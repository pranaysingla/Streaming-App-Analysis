2020-08-08 17:45:12,"Good content, bad User interface",3,Goldentoast01,False,"Sorry HBO I really love your shows, but here are the things I have issues with your App and your Xbox One version of the app (it seems like others are having a problem with this too, like Ps4)

My List- this is always a great function in a streaming service. When it’s accessible... My List does not always appear in HBO Max. Additionally doesn’t not list all the things you’ve added to it when it does. This is frustrating for people who are trying to watch something they have added, only to have to search for it again. Big no no.

Episode Selection- watching a show sometimes you miss something, wether you got busy around the house or fell asleep, I know I can find the episodes.. if I search for it again. But unlike other apps I can’t select another episode from the episode I’m in. For example. Netflix on the Xbox, or PlayStation. While watching an episode you can hit (X on Xbox) (square on PS) to view the episode list. Why do I need to search it again. 

All in all I respect the Swift Roll-Out for HBO Max, and switching the subscriptions from HBO to HBO Max. But the Max App for Console and Phone is MISSING vital features to a streaming service. I highly suggest fixing these issues because I don’t want to see your app use slow down or disappear all together. Even after a boost in advertisements, not having these functions could end the popularity of your service. Please consider these thoughts and I hope to look forward to these changes."
2020-06-12 22:06:33,Great content! App is crap...,2,newb910,False,"I love the content they have. Friends, Fresh Prince, and Big Bang are all great shows from over the decades. They also have a nice selection of movies. At the moment, their “Max” originals are lacking but it’s new so I will give them time.

The issue I have is that AT&T has never put out an app that isn’t full of frustrating glitches. This hasn’t changed with HBO Max. For example, most of the time when starting a show or movie, it gets stuck on buffering and no matter how long you wait it will not play. I end up having to go out and restart the show several times. The same thing happens when it auto plays the next episode. Then, when the show does start playing, sometimes it’s a completely different episode than the one I selected. For a company who has massive resources, there’s no excuse for putting out an app that doesn’t accomplish the one thing it’s designed to do. At least AT&T is generous enough to include HBO Max with their unlimited elite plan. That is the only reason I put up with these issues otherwise I wouldn’t waste my money.

Update: Most of my streaming’s problems are when I’m connected to my TV through the digital AV connector. It seems when I watch movies or series directly on the iPad it’s not as glitchy."
2020-10-18 21:29:34,Content Good - App Bad,2,S.C. Watts,False,"I’ve only had the app for a couple of weeks but already it’s got major issues compared to other streaming apps that I am not sure how they aren’t fixing...
When connecting to watch on my TV via Chromecast it will just stop a few episodes (or sometimes halfway into the very first episode I watch) and look like it’s “buffering” but really it’s just a connection issue, or something along those lines and it will never actually resume. The only way to continue watching is to disconnect, restart the app and reconnect which is ridiculous.
Other issues include some of the user interface irritabilities others have pointed out like the “continue watching” section giving you no options to go to the show details, episode selection, etc. and the fact that you can skip the ads and intros when watching in the app on your device, but not when casting from your device.
All of these issues make for a very clunky, unprofessional and honestly overpriced viewing experience. I’m really just binge-watching all the shows I got the subscription for so I can cancel after one month, and resubscribe in the future once they learn how to build a proper streaming app."
2020-06-12 03:48:07,Great idea but poor execution,2,Isome2000,False,"I love the idea of HBO streaming service. Since I’m a Direct TV customer I was even more excited because it’s included for no extra charge. However, I’m very disappointed to find that not only is there a maximum download limit for the entire household of 30 downloads and worst of all it seems like every time you leave the app screen it pauses your downloads. Perhaps it’s just me but even when I leave the app open in the background while I text or check email I go back to the app screen to find everything was paused while I multitasked. The 30 downloads per household maximum, if you are using all 5 profiles, really limits your ability to download much depending on what the other users download for themselves and frankly if the app can’t/won’t download your selections if you leave it open in the background so you can multitask it will take so long for people like myself to download our selections it becomes counterproductive and makes it far quicker and more efficient to simply buy the series you’re interested. I sincerely hope the app improves as time goes on, as I recognize that it is new, because I love the idea but hate the poor execution."
2020-06-22 21:32:54,Functionality not quite there,3,Madelinebelton292016,False,"The app seems to work for the most part, but I don’t like a few things: it seems weird that when I click on something in the continue watching section, there is no way for me to pick another episode from there. It seemed I had to go to the search option to find the show and THEN I could pick the episode I wanted, rather than where I left off (I often fall asleep while it’s on auto play and have to go back.) Also, it keeps giving me the cellular warning over and over, even tho I’ve turned that fiction off in the settings. One time it changed my setting for streaming with cellular data, and wouldn’t play at all until I switched the setting back. So weird. 

One more comment, why does the iPhone app allow you to jump ahead 15 seconds but the browser version on my computer does not?

All in all the app is okay, and I like the extra content as compared to HBO now. But why the separate version of HBO? Just come out with one for goodness sake!"
2020-09-02 10:58:18,Broken downloads feature,3,Shardik,True,"For the most part, this is a decent app.  The content is great, of course. Download management is poorly designed. Currently you must click edit, then scroll through your list, X out the download you don’t want, then scroll back up and click Done. It’s a lot of real estate to go through. Secondly, downloads don’t play on their own off of the phone unless the phone is taken off network. So if I have a slow or poor internet connection, shows don’t play immediately  or at all, and I suspect that they’re eating data instead of playing off of my phone. Downloads only play well in these circumstances if I set the phone to Airplane mode. Finally, the Renew option doesn’t work. If I click on the exclamation point to renew, I get a dialog to Renew or Cancel. Click on Renew and nothing happens; no shows or movies renew. I can only get them back if I delete and redownload them.  Like I said, it’s a decent app, but this part proves to be a frustrating experience."
2020-07-09 02:49:38,It’s cool but...,3,just axel reviweing,False,"I wish I could give this a star or Maybe 2, But when my parents want to watch something in Spanish they have to go to Latino to do so but what if they don’t want to watch the stuff there what if they want to see for say ford v Ferrari they you don’t get the option to hear the audio in Spanish and can’t even get subtitles to even at least read what they say translated in English to Spanish and/or audio. On a side not please get more of the best movies Warner’s media has made not some of these titles that were made like 30 years before I was born apps like these are usually attracting the younger crowed and at times (like my parents) get some time off work to watch a movie with there kids (like mine who unfortunately don’t fluently speak or understand English[i guess that might be the reason I’m writing this because I want to watch a movie with my parents without telling them every now and then what they are talking about/say])"
2020-06-04 14:28:41,HBO Now My List is missing,2,mrhoni,True,"Update 6/4/20 - Developer response was not very helpful, including the link that was provided in developer response.  I’m not certain that the link was telling me that My List was not supposed to transfer to the new app and be available.  I know where My List was supposed to be and I know where new items added to the list in the new app will show up, but irritated that I have to search and add again all items that were on my list.  Good thing it was not a huge list.

After updating HBO NOW on my Apple TV to HBO Max, I no longer have a My List or at least can’t find it.  I found the Joker movie, which was on My List prior to update, and added it to My List.  However, I can’t find My List to even see the Joker is added to it in HBO, but I can see it in HBO Max, but still all my My List from HBO Now are not there.

Now I’m just doing searches for movies that I have on a separate list.  I searched for Glass, find it, and now instead of My List its added to Up Next.  Where the heck is Up Next?"
2020-10-10 10:47:31,Worst customer service,1,Mulcak,False,"I created an account before the app was available. The app worked for one week and then I wasn’t able to play anything. I kept calling their customer service multiple times, I’d get an email from a service tech and I’d respond and nothing. Finally some rep discovered that my emails weren’t getting through. So now I had to call literally every time to respond to emails. This meant re explaining everything every time I called. But the phone reps wouldn’t just transfer me to the techs. They would try to trouble shoot. Pretty sure if my ticket was escalated to their tier 3 techs, you phone reps aren’t going to be able to help. But even the techs weren’t helpful. Every single person I worked with just asked me the same things over and over again even though it was documented multiple times. 1. Device information 2. Is my device up to date? 3. Is the app up to date? 4. What is my internet speeds? 5. Turn it off and back on.  After that when it still wouldn't work they would escalated it. For 5 months not one person tried anything different. 

I finally got fed up and just wanted to cancel. I spoke with a women she “canceled” my account. I requested to be refunded for every month this service didn’t work for me and they refused. Only refunded me for 1 month. 

Now I say “cancel” because I just got charged again today. So now I have to call them yet again. 

Horrible, horrible experience. Worst company I have ever worked with. One star is too many stars."
2020-08-01 21:58:21,One issue,4,Mer-Gamer,False,"Overall it’s an amazing app, you couldn’t possibly run out of content to watch.. there’s one problem I’ve ran into to, that’s downloading movies or videos often times when the app is in the background or if the phone locks it destroys all progress coming back to see it’s not downloaded and having to find the movie or show again and download it.. you have to literally stay on the page to keep it there so it’s a shame however once done it does stay downloaded. If could please fix this I’d consider going from my trial and to full membership. However I feel my membership has been ruined by that because I was gonna use it for a week away into a area with hardly data or wifi.. it’s not likely I could get another chance either but good app just please fix that and I may consider coming back and buying a full membership"
2020-07-08 19:21:22,Forced into HBO Max,3,AshB1717,False,"I liked HBO go and I used it all the time. In the middle of an episode I paused suddenly it was no longer supported and I was forced to download HBO Max. None on the items on My Lis transferred and I wasn’t even sure what season I was on by this point.
I can’t stand the new look. It’s trying to copy the appearance of other online companies and I don’t care for their look either. I don’t enjoy the scroll screen when I search for shows/movies or even just my list. I preferred the screen showing 6 movies and then it moves up. For some reason the side scroll makes me sick and sets off migraines. I’ve stopped using the other companies bc of it and I was happy with the other format you provided. Either I’m going to have to know what I was specifically, let my husband search, or move on somewhere else. I don’t enjoy being forced out of something I have grown accustomed to and I felt was way more user friendly."
2020-06-21 23:45:05,Not working,2,Ms Angie,False,"Currently I use this through my cable provider (wow! Cable) without signing up for an hbo Mac account and I’ve used it twice so far with no problems, it allowed me to make a profile and cast through chromecast.  Each time I’ve used it is has not saved that I’ve logged in before. I have to go through the entire log in through my cable provider every time.  I’ve done this today and when I go to play an actual video it automatically says I’m not logged in and starts over. It will not play as of today. Every video I try keeps saying log in even though the play button finally appeared after logging in before. Don’t know what to do other than to say it’s currently unusable. 

Seems like when it works it’s great but it has to work. I don’t like casting a show or a movie to be an entire process of searching providers, logging in, starting over...each and every time. Please save our provider information and please figure out why it’s currently unusable."
2020-07-10 02:23:32,"Could use more content, but loving it 📺",4,AfflictionKing,False,"When I saw this app being announced, I wasn’t onboard on getting it. But when I saw this tweet from Cartoon Network that there were bringing some classics, I had to at least give it a try.
So I downloaded, scroll through everything and I was like wowed on the contents from Cartoon Network, adult swim, crunchy roll, DC comics, and so on... it was like ultimate app to have if you’re a 90’s baby lol.
My only minor complaint is that there’s not that much content from Cartoon Network like: Ed, Edd, n Eddy, the grim adventure of Billy & Mandy, courage the cowardly dog and so on.. same goes from some the other channels.... which was actually the very reason I decided to get it, since those shows were being teased in.
But I understand could be some licensing thing and I do hope more and more content could be added. I am enjoying this and can’t wait for Harley Quinn"
2020-09-11 14:43:43,Not able to watch downloaded movies without service?,3,Kstauder,False,"I recently downloaded a couple movies in preparation for a long plane ride. I was quite excited that this is now a function and I was even going to give the “Raised by Wolves” show a try. Once in the air on the plane I was unable to access the app. Every time I opened the app it came up with an error that HBO MAX couldn’t connect. Me, a rational person, wasn’t concerned because I had downloaded movies. But the developers of this app decided that if the app is unable to get service you would be locked out of the app by a barrage of error messages, restricting access to any content you may have downloaded. What is the point of downloading movies if you are unable to watch them offline?
The downloaded movies need accessibility while you don’t have service. Severely disappointed by this failure on HBOs part. (Intentional or not)"
2020-08-12 23:49:12,Pretty Good,4,Sassy_mcRaffy,False,"Just downloaded this as my subscription was included with my new phone plan. It’s so great so far but I feel like it’s still a bit lacking. Unlike other streaming services the content here isn’t diluted with a bunch of nothing, all the series here look and feel quality. This is especially true considering when browsing the associated channels. However the series amount does seem a bit limited, especially in the horror and international sections. I’d like to see more genres like Mexican soap operas and asian dramas be included. On the topic of genre they have a sizable anime selection so I find it a bit strange that they don’t have that as a category yet. And for viewing series I wish they included a time for the individual episodes so you’d know how long the show is before you start it. Overall great new app and I’m excited to see how it develops."
2020-07-29 08:50:17,"It's okay, but could be better",4,sievrdt,False,"First of all – great choice of titles, kudos to HBO for winning over the shows like South Park and Friends along with the all-time favorite HBO originals!
As for the app itself – the UI/UX is not friendly at all. E.g. traditionally on iOS there's a back button in the upper left-hand corner; it is here too, except that only the left half of that button takes you back, and the right half takes you to the list of episodes... I guess it's convenient, but it's really counterintuitive. Same thing with the preview pictures – tap in the middle takes you to the episode's page, but tap in the corner starts playing immediately.
Just make buttons look like buttons, and if it's two buttons, make them look like two buttons – don't re-invent the wheel.
Also, please add support for iPad's Smart Keyboard – it shouldn't be too hard."
2020-08-27 03:38:28,The Infinity Train,3,Ethan Me,False,"Please please please keep making more Infinity Train, it’s many people’s favorites on this app. I heard that it might not get a 4th season because people might now be willing to buy HBO Max for it, so other people might pirate the show. One of the reasons why people will pirate is because they’re not willing to pay that much money for another streaming service, but also because HBO Max isn’t available in other countries. Many people from other countries really want to buy HBO Max and watch the content, but it’s not available to them and you may not see the numbers you want to see on series like The Infinity Train, so if it could be more accessible to more people, more people might buy this streaming service.

Edit: ok, so I got the app working, but pleaseeeee keep The Infinity Train going. Lots of kids can relate to the struggles of the characters, and it’s so well done."
2020-05-31 22:39:09,Poorly considered app,1,Christopher91206,False,"1) Auto Play: you can’t turn it off, it won’t turn itself off. If you fall asleep watching a series, it will play all night. Good lock finding where you left off

2) If you watch a series that is not on your “list,” it’s hard to get back to it without using the search function. “Continue Watching” takes you back to the last episode of the series you finished watching with no apparent pathway to choose an episode from the series. (So from the “continue Watching” menu, if you last watched Episode 5 of a series, it’s easy to rewatch Episode 5, but not so easy to get to episode 6.) 

3) The thing I hate about Netflix is that it is hard to find content—there’s so much there that you’re not seeing. Netflix at least tried to cater to your likes, to give a selection based on your viewing preferences, but this basic issue of streaming services was made worse with HBO Max. They seem to offer you some basic selections, and there’s no real education about what’s there. 

4) Searching movies by genre is convoluted. The page never loads all the way. It loads 12-15 selections then stops. If I Choose a movie, then back out of that screen, it will load a few more movies, but finding material is a nightmare, the bigger the catalog, the worse the problem. 

5) No Roku. I can’t use it in my living room. (As usable as it is.) I can’t believe this is the best effort of one of the biggest media companies on the planet."
2020-08-04 00:35:11,"Great content, kinks in usability",3,Sierra McGill,False,"Definitely room for a lot of improvements with download function on mobile. Many times when I try to select something from the downloads section that I’ve already downloaded it will glitch and tell me I need to be using wi-if to stream. If I try multiple times or close and revisit the download section it will right itself and start the downloaded video. Anytime you close or switch between the app (if you get a quick text etc) it completely resets and you have to go back through all the steps to get to where you were, which is troublesome if you’re streaming from a phone. Wish there was a longer pause in the app holding your place. All the new content is excellent and the color scheme of the app is great contrast for visibility. Just needs to be a little more reliable/consistent."
2020-05-27 17:47:00,Love HBO Max,5,Gshyne87,False,"I didn’t have a problem with logging in with my hbo now information I just wish it was available on roku tv maybe in the future. At least it’s available on all my iOS devices, xbox one s & playstation 4 the only bit of a downside no 4K HDR10 content. I was glad to find out I can watch og teen titans, rick & morty, impractical jokers, the boondocks, fresh prince of bel air, adventure time, tom & jerry, also all seven films of harry potter. The hbo max hubs include dc, sesame workshop, tcm (turner classic movies) along with studio ghibli, cartoon network collection, adult swim collection, crunchyroll collection & looney tunes. My overall experience is great I still enjoy it i’ll definitely be keeping my hbo max subscription because they’re just gonna add more content next year & i’m looking forward to it all."
2020-07-26 11:59:40,Great title selection. Horrible interface.,3,o821,False,"This post is mostly about the interface. I feel like the discovery/home page is very limiting in titles. Instead of just providing and endless list of scrolling, each section just has a set of 8 or 9 movies to choose from. There’s no “suggested titles” when you click on a show/movie to get me to view other similar titles. Lastly the most annoying thing is on mobile when I go to adjust the volume, it brings up the time scroll bar and all the other settings in the viewfinder...you seriously couldn’t develop just a tiny volume pop up to show you controls rather than putting all that extra stuff on the screen and interrupting the viewing experience? Hope this review actually gets read and you guys can fix some of those issues. Especially the volume thing."
2020-05-27 20:06:18,5 ⭐️ for HBO but 2 ⭐️ for the rest,3,Phunkedawg,False,"I had huge expectations for the new HBO Max.  I woke up, updated my app, and proceeded to check out the “new” offerings.  Though I still thoroughly love HBO’s original content, I am left a bit disappointed in the Max content.  Impractical Jokers only has the first two seasons; I had hoped for the whole original Looney Tunes series; there’s not a whole lot of the DC content as I was expecting; just a lot of old movies and incomplete series.  Hopefully they will absorb all of DC’s content in the future and add complete seasons of stuff that’s missing.  Besides those issues, the app seems clunky with much of the content images barely loading on my device. I would blame my internet, but all of my other streaming apps work fine, as does the original HBO content. I’m sure things will improve in time, but until then, I will only give the app 3 stars."
2020-08-16 13:08:10,It’s fine,4,AJShadowz,False,"When seeing negative reviews I always try and go though a bunch of them too see what people have to say rather than just accepting the star ratings given. 

That being said, I find that more often than not countless bad reviews on products and services are a result of user error or downright incompetence. I use this app on iPhone 11 Pro Max, iPad Pro, ps4, and my laptop. Works just fine 95% of the time. People tend to be too critical and it’s not a companies fault that a large majority of the population lack the mental capacity to solve the smallest of problems. 

The only issue that I have is that from time to time my show will freeze and I’ll have to go back to home screen and restart it. Other than that I have no problem finding things, playing things, enjoying things. If you are seeing a show in “continue watching” and want to see ALL the episodes available, select it, and when it pops up click on the series the title just ABOVE the thumbnail and all episodes will show up. It’s not hard to figure out. 

So for me, HBO please work on the occasional freezing/glitching and the addition of an auto play on/off option would be nice. Other than that I love the app. Thanks."
2020-07-27 18:15:27,HBO Max is Working Impaired,2,GamerCane,False,"HBO Max joins the plethora of big-business apps which show 0 regard for the visually impaired tv- and movie-watching population. It’s really easy to build accessible apps from the ground up. It’s harder to implement accessibility after release. At least this app occasionally does something when I tap on it and would, in theory, let me watch something.
I managed to sign in because I explored my screen thoroughly by touch (many blind people swipe from item to item, which doesn’t work at all in this app for ... some inexplicable reason.) I clicked on several categories and each failed to correspond with its label, though the labels were readable.
It’s like many apps. It starts somewhat useable and ends up disappointingly, predictably, foolishly useless.
Worse yet, the parent companies of these apps keep saying, over and over, that they really do care about accessibility. Forgive us if we decline to agree."
2020-06-07 09:17:06,Fix the list,3,JaxGam,False,"So I was pleasantly surprised with all the content. Specifically the older series like Fresh Prince and the TCM, Looney Tunes and DC hubs. Plus some great Criterion Collection selections. 

The sole reason for my 3 star rating is the My List function. I went through the vast content and added several things to my list. 

First, your list is not easily located. It’s on the main page. There isn’t a Home icon (Apple TV App) so you have to back into it using your Menu button on the remote which takes you through all the visited screens. So if you browsed different hubs or categories, you have to back through all of those to get to the home page. 

Once I found my list, I scrolled through to find my last 8 or 10 additions and the last option to “See More.” When I select that I get redirected to the top of the home screen. So after I spent all that time building my list so I won’t have to endlessly search for content I like later, I can’t even access the bulk of it. 

While I can deal with the inconvenient way of accessing the home page, the My List option isn’t functional so serves no purpose to me. Wasted a chunk of my life browsing and adding to a feature I can’t access. If that is fixed, this app would easily be 5 stars for me."
2020-10-12 02:58:16,Downloads,2,Jlc22451,False,"For $15 a month, I should be able to temporarily download to my laptop, a feature that I’m able to do with Netflix. Due to poor internet connection in my room, being able to download to the laptop allows me to actually watch shows and still use my phone.

I forgot to check the billing date, and was just charged, which was my fault, but if I stayed on top of that, I would have chosen to skip the HBO subscription this month, and used Netflix instead. This month I’ll have to keep HBO, but I’ve canceled it for next month, and next month I will keep Netflix instead simply because of the ability to download to my laptop. It’s also frustrating to have U-verse, pay for U-verse, but not have HBO max included. I honestly only have it for lovecraft country, and will probably be done with the service all together when I finish the series.

EVEN STILL with the ability to download to my phone, I have the same issue as another user who commented about being able to connect a device to the tv. The downloaded episodes are so frustrating to get to work properly when connected to the tv, I end up just watching it on my phone, which is no fun when you’re trying to watch with someone else. 

Too expensive, not worth the content in comparison to the many other streaming services."
2020-06-09 20:38:52,Language selection,2,Cjml2,False,When I saw the list of anime that was added I got pretty excited however when I noticed only a few of them come with both English and Japanese language while the rest only come in Japanese audio and many of those anime series I know have English dubbed versions of them as well but HBO MAX doesn’t have them. Also the old Godzilla movies that are on there which I was pretty excited to see but found only two out of all of them had English audio while the rest were Japanese audio only. I’m sorry but to each their own if they understand the Japanese language or don’t mind reading subtitles but for me after work when I want to watch an anime series or an old Godzilla movie I’m not in the mood to read subtitles after a long day of work. I’m sorry but the app and the HBO MAX service is lacking and right now all it’s good for us just steaming HBO content new movies and the DC universe movies
2020-09-24 01:47:04,Problematic with iOS 14 and Chromecast,3,jluther,False,"A pretty good app but it definitely needs work on its Chromecast connection. This is important, of course, since because of contract disputes, it can’t have any of its Max content seen on Roku. So, naturally, it’s a good idea to cast it to one’s big screen via Chromecast. 

But it doesn’t work under ios14. Not at all until Local Network is turned back on in manual settings— Apple reset it— but even then very glitchy and slow and “how do I do this?” Once Local Network is on, it just churns to connect. It will get there from the main screen (not the program) eventually, in my experience so far. But mainly, I’ve been casting from an old iPhone 6, which doesn’t have these new operating systems. Works fine. 

So: Apple and HBO Max and Google, please pull up your socks and get this seamlessly working, as it was before iOS 14."
2020-06-26 00:46:28,Maybe a few bugs?,3,captainahole,False,"I love all the content as compared to the original HBO, and the app itself is easy to use and navigate. However, every time I leave the app to check a message or if I turn off the screen, it closes out the app entirely and I have to restart it, and it resets whatever I was watching back to the beginning. It doesn’t save my watch progress. Also, it resets my downloads back to 0% every time the app closes. Please make it to where it can run in the background and not close entirely if I have to leave the app or turn off my screen. It’s very frustrating when I want to watch or download something and it resets my progress every time I have to do something else in my phone (iPhone).

Otherwise, it’s a great subscription, I just think the app just needs more optimization."
2020-06-03 07:31:52,WHY???,1,Alice Valkyrie,False,"The old NOW app won’t even load without this update, which I cannot download because my iOS isn’t supported (it’s not even that old, why do this-don’t you want as many customers as possible)? The new app is not supported on roku either.

TL;DR: This is a premium streaming network with exclusive streaming rights to one of my favorite shows (that I’ve been unable to stream since January b/c of your deal, so, you know, thanks for that too) and I. CAN’T. EVEN. USE. IT. 😡

Guess I’ll finally be buying the rest of the Blu-Ray box sets for new Doctor Who (and perhaps a couple of HBO shows) and forgetting this app exists unless things change quickly. Even my satellite provider hasn’t offered HBO for over a year now. I literally have no way to access your content anymore w/o buying DVDs/Blu-Rays. This will mean significantly less money for you in the long run (because I won’t be buying shows I’ve never seen on the chance I’ll like them) but apparently you don’t care. 🤷‍♀️"
2020-10-03 01:37:08,A nightmare to use when streaming,2,tkn_11,False,"This app is a UX nightmare when streaming to your tv. It’s actually shocking to me that somehow it got push through. When I cast it to my tv, usually the preview for a show will play again (even if you watch it on your phone already) or just spin in circle waiting to load. Once you get it to play on your tv, don’t bother trying to do anything else. The control interface at the bottom of the screen will disappear. How do you get it to appear again? Who knows. It’s a random luck of the draw.  Trying to find the control interface once casting is torturous. Also discovered tonight that apparently the 15-seconds fast forward button actually rewinds it 15-seconds. 

I’m convinced that no one tested this app before the launch. If you are only playing through your phone or iPad, great!! If you’re going to try and cast it to your tv... good luck!"
2020-06-20 16:04:39,HBO changing so often and do not care about customer experience,1,TrustMeIPlayaDrOnTV,False,"We were long time customers, but with all the changes from cutting ties with Dish, then going to the Now platform, then the Max platform its caused too much headache. Content isn’t that much better than Netflix to be worth the constant headaches. HBO can’t even keep their own online FAQs with links to the right places to log in. I don’t think they have the right man power behind their technical solutions - stretched too thin with frequent changes and having to support Now, Go, and Max platforms concurrently. Their app streaming quality sub-par on multiple different platforms and devices I’ve used. They are experts in entertainment not software, and it shows! Also not so great at making transitions easy for customers. Don’t waste your money, wait to buy until they get their model back to working with providers. They aren’t handling the transition to direct delivery themselves very well."
2020-06-03 01:55:45,Garbage,1,tord furgeson,False,"When HBO max launches my account was apparently deleted. When trying to access the Catalogue I was told that I hadn’t had an active account since June of 2019 despite using and being charged for hbo now until last week.
After called customer support twice, being told I would be contacted about my issue being escalated to someone who could help me I called today to try and find out how to stop further charges for an account I was unable to use. The operator stated canceling was simple and with no attempt at retention canceled my account. When I inquired about a refund for the charge I received on the 28th he told me that hbo has a no refun policy. Further inquiries led to findings that someone had fixed my account without notifying of the resolution to my escalation and that I’d just canceled service and would be charged to reactivate. 
So now I’m without hbo and cannot receive refund for service hbo’s error prevented me from using. 
Great customer service."
2020-09-14 14:41:24,App is less than AIGHT,3,glentippets,False,"HBO in terms of content, is for sure my favorite out of all streaming services. But the app is trash on all devices. It only works about 60% of the time on the smart tv app and the mobile app isn't too much better. 

Shows are always loading or glitching, and the app layout is way more complicated than it should be. Theres no skip intro option, like on other platforms which gets old because every single episode you have to fast forward through the intro and then it loads forever because its always glitchy. The app layout overall needs to be easier and cleaner to use. 
HBO subscription price is pretty high for all the glitches, complicated layout, and they still sneak in little ads every now and again. Love the shows, but the app has a long ways to go."
2020-09-10 04:41:50,Great Content but Bad App/Website,2,DestineeSinclair,False,"I love HBO movies and TV Shows however I have had numerous issues with the apps across all different devices. The app won’t load majority of times and when it finally does it sometimes won’t register I am taping on my profile. (I know this is an HBO Max issue because it does this on Xbox one, PS 4, Laptop, iPad, and iPhone). It often will freeze in the middle of a show and I have to restart the app. Most of the time it won’t even load the start page. It sometimes won’t show my continue watching list which is frustrating because we don’t always know which episode we ended on. Overall, I just have had issues with it loading and working properly. I do enjoy watching HBO movies and shows it’s just extremely frustrating to pay for a service and not be able to use the app or website to watch them."
2020-06-28 21:54:47,No WiFi...No Video,2,tjseagrove,False,"So, I download a few videos to watch while traveling.  I start watching one, then have to board the plane.  Now that we are in the air I decide to watch the rest of the video...would you believe, the app won’t open up to let me watch the video because it can’t reach the servers.  What is the point of downloading if you can’t watch them “off line” ???? 

Another annoyance...if you have a downloaded video and you click on the video from the main menu, even though it says it is downloaded, it will stream the video instead of using the downloaded data.  You have to goto My Stuff and look at the downloads and play from there.  Once on the ground (from the scenario above) I didn’t have WiFi but did have cellular so the app opened but I had the app set to not stream over cellular.  That is how I found the streaming issue.

Simple fixes..."
2020-07-01 17:15:52,Lol how does this get released,1,Gaspatchosoup,False,This service is such a mess it’s not even funny. So today in the just added section they added the newest fantastic 4 movie that bombed. The icon is the new movie but when you select it the main movie is the original one with Jessica Alba and Chris Evans but the one below it is a picture of the new one and says extended version. No matter which one you select it’s the old movie. Has HBO just been released or has the service been around for a long time? Another thing is take mad tv where most of each season is missing random episodes and if you watch episode 2 and the next one is 4 it will bounce you back to the menu cause it can’t continue episodes if they are not the very next one. For the price this is and the mess that it is it’s not worth it at all. Never have I ever experienced issues like this with other services that haven’t been around as half as long as HBO.
2020-08-30 23:42:21,Disappointing,2,TaliaKhrystian,False,"The app constantly crashes and constantly had an issue with buffering and we don’t have an issue with any other streaming apps doing this. 
On top of that, we have a roku tv and since the app is still not available on roku it’s just a hassle to have to hook up another console to watch it on. First world problems, I know. But with everything else being so accessible it just makes the flaws in this more apparent. I was content to wait for it to get on roku but it’s been months and still no word. It’s really a shame because the show and movie selection is great.  Maybe that’s why I kept paying $16 a month for a service that has been such a disappointment. But this is definitely stopping this month, maybe I’ll hive it a shot again when it’s roku compatible, but for now the price isn’t worth the unreliable service."
2020-06-22 01:39:37,Downloaded Feature Needs WORK,2,Carz333,False,"I was very happy to see Batwomen available on here for download! I had an upcoming road trip and needed something to watch during it, Batwomen being what I thought would work. So, I downloaded it, but it kept making me restart, had a hard time loading, and didn’t download in order (not that that’s much of a problem), it was overall very frustrating. Although this all could have been because of my WiFi. Eventually I was able to download the episodes I needed, but then when I went into the car to try and watch them none of the episodes would load, even though they were downloaded. I really don’t understand why this won’t work, I understand this is a fairly new app, so malfunctions are expected, but I hope this can be fixed soon so that I can watch Batwomen on my next road trip!"
2020-06-11 16:30:30,Refuses to work off of WiFi/cellular,2,mnyc80,False,"What’s the point of allowing users to download content if the app insists on a connection even to simply open? Even when I get it to open, it’s impossible to tell if a video is playing off of the app or sucking up my data. A major fail for such a well-funded app.

Update to developer response:
Even when I start watching from the downloads section I get a warning about data usage anytime I venture away from WiFi signal. If I then turn off cellular to make sure my program is playing from the download and not using data, the app refuses to open due to lack of signal and says “try again.”  When I ultimately get back into the app and return to my downloads, the program does not remember where I left off and restarts from the beginning. In short, this app still needs a lot of work."
2020-07-11 20:18:28,"Great additional programming, but has a long way to go technically.",3,FloridaGator1Card,False,"While the additional programming is great, I really don’t understand why they didn’t keep the same exact series navigation that you could do in HBO GO and HBO NOW. It was so easy to get to the lists of seasons and their associated episodes, but now with max it’s definitely different. This new app also doesn’t pass through dolby digital 5.1 to Chromecast. I know this because I used HBO GO for years and they worked hard to fix a lot of the bugs along the way. I really hope for the same experience with HBO Max, we just have to report all the problems so hopefully they will work hard to fix them. At least things are generally functional, so that’s a good start, they just have several tweaks to make to get it up to par."
2020-07-01 19:00:33,"Good content, Bad UI and Optimization",3,Person who reviewed this.,False,"The first part of the title is self explanatory so I’ll skip to the second. The user interface can be frustrating to use. It isn’t easy to access other episodes. Not all content that qualifies for the “last chance” and “just added” categories actually shows up there. What annoys me most, however, is how poorly optimized the iphone app is. It takes longer than many of my other apps to open, but that wouldn’t be so terrible if it stayed open while I use other apps. I could switch to a messaging app for a few seconds, come back, and it’ll have to reopen. That’s my biggest gripe. It’s a new service, but some of these things have been done so much better by other services that I wonder how they can exist this way at all."
2020-05-28 03:15:41,Great selection and almost great interface,3,admmikal,False,"Would’ve rated it higher except for the search feature on the tvOS version of the app. It is absolutely inexcusable to force users to type in a search query letter by letter on Apple TV like that. There is dictation support and keyboard support using your iPhone or iPad to type. Instead you chose to make it as difficult as possible to do a search and is the most difficult streaming app to do a search on Apple TV with. You don’t make someone a computer or tablet search like that, why did anyone think it was a good idea to do it on Apple TV when it’s just as unnecessary? Other than that it’s a great app but when the purpose of an app is to curate and allow people to search a database, it’s inexcusable to make searching so unnecessarily painful."
2020-08-29 23:39:37,"Great content, worse design",3,35volts,False,"HBO GO's design was great. I gave that app 5 stars then. I don't like reviewing new apps, but 3 months is more than enough for HBO Max to reconsider its design. I love HBO and the titles they have like The Wire, The Vow, Watchmen, LWT. The anime and CN/adult swim titles are really good too. Despite this it still feels like an app that was rushed in a week made to compete with Disney+ (miles ahead btw). It's not the worse design (like Crackle or Peacock) but I have noticed just a few things that can improve the interface.

* The background is literally a static PNG.
* Profiles should have pictures. It shouldn't be that hard to make.
* The ""about"" tab only gives a brief synopsis. I don't expect a Wikipedia info box but there should be more there to fill the blank space.
* (anime in particular PLEASE) the option to change audio/captions mid way through video like Netflix. I don't want to be looking for transcripts learning the language and switching tabs.
* Add resolution options on the download page, for those without much storage space.
* (unrelated to the app) More keyboard shortcuts to the web player on PC please? Just left arrow=back, right arrow=forward"
2020-09-30 22:14:17,Incredibly frustrating,2,demonrabbit,False,"This app’s ability to control what I’m watching on my chromecast is virtually nonexistent. The pause/play bar disappears almost immediately, and often there’s no way to get it back. I exit and go back into the app, and even though it’s still connected to chromecast, the pause/play option is unavailable, so essentially I have to disconnect if I need to pause it to go do anything. Or I can select the episode again, it which case it has to buffer and there’s a 50/50 chance it’ll start playing from an earlier point of the movie or episode because it can’t keep up. And often the pause/play control STILL doesn’t show up.
There’s also no easy option to go to series details if I want to choose another episode of the same show. Everything requires an annoying workaround."
2020-07-28 10:13:57,Everything is terrible,1,Shneur1234,True,"Despite having downloaded videos over Wi-Fi, it tries streaming the downloaded videos over cellular data, videos constantly can’t load with perfect Internet connection (not even slow, just won’t load at all), and it always locks you out of your account randomly. The worst streaming app by a mile.

Edit for developer: Yes, I am watching the downloads from the download section, and I still get the darn notification that I’m streaming over cellular data. The only way to avoid streaming over cellular data (even from the downloads section, not the main screen) is to shut off my cellular data, and then it usually locks me out of the app because it can’t verify my account without cellular data, even though I was logged in two seconds ago... Terrible app. Don’t blame this on me. I know where to watch the downloads from. Your app is just awful."
2020-08-03 02:17:24,Disappointing,1,BananaPantRamblr,False,"For such a hyped-up service, the HBO Max app leaves much to be desired. The content itself is great, but I have no other way to stream said content except through the app, and to say that is a frustrating mess is a gross understatement. Programs constantly get hung up or stop playing altogether, and at times impossible to start. Oftentimes a preview will play before a show without issue only to have my connection with Apple TV will drop out completely. I would suspect something on my end might cause the issue, but I do not have similar problems using other streaming apps. 

Then there’s the interface, which I also find frustrating to deal with for numerous reasons but will not go into detail here since that may not apply to everyone else. 

The technical issues are inexcusable for such a large media company and $15 price tag. I know a better job can be done."
2020-06-12 20:53:47,Internet Disconnect,2,grendel666,False,I thought this would be as good as the previous versions but no. I was trying to watch the beforeigners and after a little bit into the show I would get a message that it was not available. After a few times of this I noticed that my router would reset itself and reboot. I don’t need someone saying that it is my equipment since this only happens when I use this app. Until they fix this issue it looks like I will be spending money on something that does not work. I did an online search and noticed that people where having the same issues. I doubt that will fix this anytime soon and will probably only respond by saying contact there support team. Why should I do that if I explained the issue in this review. This is not a thing that should not go unresolved.
2020-10-16 01:09:33,Worst Streaming App,2,browndm08,False,"I like the content but the app is not user friendly. If you’re lucky, you get one episode in before it crashes and you have to complete exit out and restart in all the ways we have to watch it including PlayStation 4, phones, and tablets. On good days, it’ll load the next episode after anyone’s guess on how long it needs to load between the episode but eventually it’ll play the next one, sometimes. But I thought we were beyond the days of waiting for things to buffer as it also does that mid shows/movies... Overall, I wish Friends would transfer to another streaming service because that’s what’s been holding me from canceling the subscription although at this point it’d be more convenient to switch out the DVDs every couple episodes, less interruption."
2020-10-08 01:54:18,“Subscription” Issue,2,noah.302,False,"Whilst signed into HBO Max with my cable provider, it tells me to subscribe wben i attempt to watch a movie or show.. So when i select “Already subscribed? Link your subscription” i do the process again of signing in with my cable provider. After i sign in, it brings me back to the page that tells me to subscribe to hbo max. So i return to the home page, go to settings, billing information, and it says “Your HBO Max subscription throught Cox has expired”. But i know for a fact that it hasnt. Bc we still have the same cable plan. The issue i’ve experienced has happened once already. We did a troubleshoot with hbo support through text chat. It solved the issue. That was maybe 2-3 weeks ago and this issue has happened again. Doesnt make sense. This happens on my phone, computers, and the xbox."

And 1 more thing, add Roku Tv!!!!! Because everyone is asking for it!!!! Please add it!!!! 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻 And again still 1 more thing or more, but whenever I'm gonna start to watch something it keeps a saying like your having bad internet connection(?) I think.

2020-06-05 01:55:06,It’s not to great....,3,Apex_550,False,"The first thing that I’d like to clarify is a bug, when launching the app sometimes it glitches and closes the app immediately which can get annoying sometimes. I also think there should be more movies and tv shows in the kids category because there really isn’t many compared to the other categories, the last thing I’d like to add is that since the tv show “Steven Universe” is added shouldn’t there be “Steven Universe: The Movie” and “Steven Universe Future” along with it since it’s a continuation of the show,  this is just a recommendation not a bug issue or anything, other than that this app is so far pretty great and I can’t blame it too much for its issues since it just came out and that will be all."
2020-07-22 21:20:58,Glitches/ dysfunctional,1,hbo max user,False,"There are so many glitches. 
#1 at times it doesn’t play the next episode. So it will stop with no option to go to the next one and if you hit play it will repeat the SAME episode.  
#2 to view all episodes you have to manually search then click on the show. You can’t access it through continue watching or while the show is playing. 
#3 when it does play the next episode (on computer) you have to click full screen every time because it automatically zooms out if it goes to the next episode 
#4 on the phone there is both a back/ fast forward 15 seconds, but on the computer there’s no fast forward just the back. 
#5 the show/ movie when first clicked on will sit there and never load. To fix this I have to ex out, go back in, and keep doing that til is loads. 
#6 the video options will CONTINUOUSLY pop up on the screen even if you turn cellular streaming/ stream over wifi on or off either way it pops up.
#7 if both cellular/ WiFi streaming is on and you don’t have WiFi it will not allow you to play the video EVEN if the cellular streaming option is on.

2020-08-09 09:04:12,Great content but terrible app performance,2,Mdthincxnkjbvcc,False,"HBO is the only streaming service that has constant glitches while trying to enjoy tv. It buffers frequently and sometimes for long periods of time. On multiple occasions the audio wouldn’t work for any content on the service even after restarting my tv twice (and all of the other streaming services were working fine). Not to mention, their partnership subscription with Samsung made it extremely difficult to cancel. And when i decides to give them another chance, they made it difficult to renew. I don’t know if the content is worth the frustration. For such a large streaming service it’s silly that they have not fixed these basic issues (especially the buffering) and will probably lose subscribers for it."
2020-06-20 02:51:10,Ad volume is out. of. control.,3,Reb8198,False,"Overall, HBO max is much the same as its predecessor, HBO now. I have one major complaint. The volume of the occasional advertisement before a show is SO much louder than the program that it scares the living daylights out of any person or animal in earshot (distance estimate: 5 miles). The worst is when I happen to step away while an episode ends and the next episode’s ad comes up and I have to come running from another room to mute the tv lest my neighbors think I’m murdering someone under cover of the cacophony. My pets run pell-mell for the safety of the bedskirts, convinced the world is ending. The volume discrepancy is so extreme that only hyperbole can begin to describe the trauma this sound imbalance inflicts upon unsuspecting viewers."

I mean it’s nice to see some shows from boomerang make it on to MAX, but I wish they had more. I have seen some of the shows that are on MAX and was blown away by how high quality it is. I really wish the person who said they were not gonna add much from Boomerang didn’t say that because I really wanted to see old Hanna Barbera look so high quality. Yes, I know the app just launched, but it launched with lots of shows, all with full episodes. By the way, how do you make (Technicolor) Popeye look so high quality?"

From:TV Watcher-27

I like all the good movies and Tv shows on HBO Max and I like how great you people created it but I think it will be better to add a few more things. 1. I think it would be better if HBO Max added a few more things to the DC section like: Arrow(Season 1-8,) The Flash(Season 1-6,) Supergirl(Season 1-5,) Dc’s Legends of Tomorrow(Season 1-5,) and Black Lightning(Season 1-3.) 2. I also think it’s better to add something else to the Cartoon Network section like: LEGO Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu(Season 1-11.) and LEGO Nexo Knights(Season 1-4.) 3. And can you also add Scooby-Doo and Guess Who?(Season 1-2)If you can please add these that would be great have and I appreciate how awesome this app is have a good day."

I’m pretty sure this isn’t a problem when using an Apple TV or accessing HBO Max using a tv app (on a tv), but when using the HBO Max app on an iPhone, the subtitles don’t work. I’ve restarted my phone and stuff, but the subtitles don’t work. I also wish it was easier to find content through a recommended section or something, rather than having to search through every genre.

Edit:
After iOS 14, auto-picture in picture was working fine at first, and still is except for HBO Max. Now HBO Max’s Picture in Picture doesn’t work automatically like other apps."
2020-06-11 05:43:39,HBO Max is fine but could be better visually,4,Agreobnr,False,"I like the hubs and the way HBO Max is organized, but they should improve in visually. Like instead of circles, the profile pictures should be characters from the WarnerMedia library like from Sesame Street, Adult Swim, HBO, Cartoon Network, Warner Bros, DC, etc (kinda like for Netflix and Disney+). Also, I wanna see all the episodes of TV shows at once quickly instead of scrolling down in the end which could take forever so decrease the episode sizes when I look at a season so it can look nice. Aside from what I said, HBO Max isn’t awful: it has fine display and great content. Can’t wait to see the changes to the app in the coming years!"
2020-08-24 05:10:16,Needs more features,4,iconicgravy,False,I really hope this gets through to the devs bc I absolutely love the app i love the show selection my problem is when i find a show that i really enjoy but i cant look at or for related titles and furthermore the way its laid out limits what shows/movies are even presented to me for example every show i watch on HBO Max i had seen a commercial or heard about and had to go and search specifically for it and i just wish it would show me more of a personalized recommendation based off of my watch history etc etc my main point i want to make here is please show related titles when you click on a show/movie thx yall c:
2020-06-06 00:42:11,"“HBO to the max”, could be.",3,Emmanuel Joy Massey,False,"The app has quite a few bugs and glitches that need to be fixed. Also, for the downloads section, the TV show downloads should be grouped as a series rather than being downloaded as individual episodes, just like how some of the other services do. That seems very much clustered, IMO. Content don’t play at times. They don’t even download at times. I also think that there should be an option to download an entire season of a series. Many features that were promised during the presentation are missing as of now and I hope those are added sooner rather than later. So far, I like the service but it can and I hope, will be better with time."

But I noticed one thing about using the app, the closed captions never work! I tried figuring it out and eventually went to the website, and did the instructions for iPhone or iOS, and they still don’t work. This is a struggle for me as I am part of the Deaf and Hard of Hearing community. I usually don’t use this app anymore because of how tired I was of figuring out what people were saying while watching. Please fix the Closed Captions as soon as possible!! Other people I know who have this app also have this issue so please fix this! But other than that, this entertainment app is great!"

However other aspects of the UI needs working on. It feels smooth but slow, would like things to be faster. Also, it is hard to get to the next episode when you aren’t on the homepage - only way is to go to the end of the video and click on the next episode pop up. Not to mention in the “Continue Watching” section, it’s hard to go back to the main title and have a look at all the episodes in that specific season (and its description) + other seasons. Would also like 4K/UHD/HDR support on iOS devices so we can get the best video quality."
2020-07-28 23:40:02,Parental controls,2,StarkKent,False,"Parental controls are a joke. Why would you put a pin to leave a profile, rather than have one to enter a profile?  If your kids start out by selecting the profile and choose the wrong one then they have access to everything. Only if they are starting with what you set with limits and try to leave that will a pin be requested. 
“Just set the other profiles with limits too!”  Well, you’d think that would be an option too, alas...it isn’t. You can’t unlock a single title within a profile. It just tells you your profile isn’t allowed to view titles with that rating. 

This is HBO after all. There should be better parental controls. HBO, take note of Amazons parental control methods. Far better to control content."

But after using the service for about a week, I am unable to view content. I have my account linked through AT&T but am unable to view content as it asks me to subscribe or link my account, which was working perfectly when i signed up. AT&T nor HBO can help, both keep telling me the other service is the issue. So as of now I pay for something I cannot use in hopes that it starts working again. I honesty never complain but I don’t know what else to do. If the service through the app doesn’t work, it’s useless to me. I would love to keep watching their content, but I simply cannot, hopefully they get a grip on their service link issues soon."
2020-05-28 23:08:01,It’s the same thing,3,cheny414,False,"It is literally a re-skin of HBO Now and even though they added some shows to the service, it isn’t a brand new experience that HBO is trying to get everyone to believe. 

There is no 4K HDR. There is no native support on my LG webOS TV. There is no subtitles in non-English languages. There is no built-in rating system. The new website still doesn’t truly stretch to full screen which bothers me in a weird way. 

Good thing is that it doesn’t cost anything extra compared to the original HBO Now, so it can only mean good things for you if you are already a frequent/long time subscriber. However, you’ll be sorely let down if you were expecting a brand new experience."
2020-07-01 15:15:24,Great app,5,Victor Freezz,False,I always have the HBO app on my phone it’s very useful for entertainment when you’re somewhere far we’re just waiting for someone and now the upgrade to HBO max which I also enjoy but I wish there was differentGrade levels of payments like they just have it monthly I wish they would come up something like three different levels like monthly every three months and yearly I would prefer a yearly subscription because it would make payments and budgeting so much easy Hopefully take a look into that but I have no complain about the app I love it thank you
2020-05-28 07:31:58,Unable to Sign In,1,LynnB80,False,"I was just watching hbo now a few hours ago. My mistake was to to update the app. I signed in with my email and password after updating and now I just get messages saying currently unavailable through your provider. However, I signed up through Apple store, same email and password. iPad is brand new, latest iOS, reinstalled the app, restarted iPad, asked for another password as that was suggested by the site and still got the currently unavailable when I only tried to reset my password. This app should not have been released as clearly there are bugs. As of this time, I suppose I will have to wait to visit desktop site on my laptop and unsubscribe from the service and billing. I may or may not resubscribe in the future, currently super frustrated with this app."
2020-07-09 22:48:03,HBO is slacking,2,Nightliker,False,"Where to start? Since HBO doesn’t take feedback (or ever respond if you figure out how to contact them), I guess bad reviews is my only option. 

They have the worst closed captioning of any service. Weekly shows like Last Week Tonight are still spitting out text well into the next scene. It’s completely unwatchable. This is crappy for parents who need quiet and for the hearing impaired. They don’t care. 

This is the only streaming service that will NOT allow you to use the phone to input search terms, so you have to use their stupid horizontal alphabet to discreetly enter each. letter. Individually. Which means searching for anything take approximately 16 times longer than it should. 

You can’t use the arrow keys on an ipad pro keyboard (or any keyboard) to fast forward or rewind

You can’t use the space bar to pause

Right now I’m watching a brand new, HBO MAX cartoon and the entire 2nd episode does not have audio synced correctly. It really seems like heads need to roll at quality control. 

I have loved HBO since I was 6 (in 1986). I’m super stoked about the Studio Ghibli partnership. I want them to do better. Please?"
2020-08-12 07:31:53,Great Content - UI/UX a little rough,4,CanzCani,True,"I was finally able to log back in on all devices with provider creds. 👍

Happy to be logged in, however, UI/UX are still not optimized. E.g., having to back out and search the show you’re in the middle of watching to see a list of all available episodes, isn’t a great experience.  While it’s a small, silly thing to complain about, the app is D2C, right? Should be a great experience all around for Cs. I’ll hold out hope that with all the user data coming in, they’ll do some testing and get it all sorted. In the meantime, I’ll keep watching the good stuff and trying to work around the UI."
2020-05-27 22:28:41,"Nice content, some issues that can be improved.",3,"A Random, But Important Critic",False,"I like this streaming app because it has some of the content that I want to watch. I think it just needs better organization. It also needs a trending list and a recommendation list. The HBO, DC, Adult Swim, Looney Tunes and TCM buttons should be near the top like the other services to better guarantee navigation. 

Also, there’s not a lot of content in the DC section. Or original content. Which I know is hard for a service that just launched. But there isn’t a lot of older content for DC. 

Other than the content, organization and navigation issues, I will still continue to stream HBO Max. There is enough to enjoy for a while."
2020-06-01 17:12:40,Needs way more testing and bug fixes..,1,Dannydiddy,False,"As an avid Friends fan, I was ecstatic to hear that both that show and my other favorite (SaTC) would be all on one platform. However, the platform has to actually work! I can navigate through the app, but no video will play—from any tv show I click on. It will give me a black loading screen, but then after several minutes says it can’t play the content. This seems like a very poor rollout considering you cannot get the app on Prime TV nor on Roku. First they don’t offer it everywhere, then where they *do* offer it, it seems like they didn’t properly test because bugs are popping up everywhere (subtitles have been an issue for others I know that have downloaded the app). Who approved this release to production????"
2020-06-07 14:58:47,First world problems.,1,lillith1208,False,"I cannot change my tv (which is a fire tv) therefore I cannot watch HBO Max. I know there are issues over the contracts but I was really excited to watch hbo max, checked each day to see if the app had updated, and then to find out that it’s not available to me because of my tv?... that’s a no from me dawg. I do not have a laptop, and why would I watch tv on my tiny phone when I specifically bought a new and larger tv less than a year ago. My only “gaming” systems are a PS2 and 3 (too old for the app). The other TVs I have access to (but watch maybe for 2 hours a week)? Not smart TVs, but have a Roku plugged in to them. 
Why would you not have contracts figured out with two of the largest streaming providers BEFORE you launched and hyped up the app/upgrade?"
2020-06-18 16:49:43,Downloading issues on cellular and other issues,3,EdErickson,False,"Downloading continues as long as the screen doesn’t go dark. Upon relog in to my phone via Face ID, the app is closed. I have to reopen. And last screen with the download isn’t what I see. I’m presented with the home screen. I have to navigate to the screen I was at. The download progression has reset to needing to restart the download. I am using a IPhone 11 Pro Max. 

Quality is good but some navigation, layout, and actions are frankly not very well designed for efficiency. Including the above issue of lack of persistence of the last screen I was at. Continually restarting at the home screen is aggravating when in and out of the app. 

Starting episodes that have been downloaded and rewinding/fast forward in then is way too slow. It behaves as if I am steaming in a lower bandwidth situation. 

Finding and deleting downloads is a confusing, tedious process with too many steps. I should just be able to swipe left on it to see a red X and then delete. Something like that."
2020-10-14 14:12:53,Frustrating & expensive,2,jmark175,True,"$15/month for a service that barely works? Half the time I get the message “Cannot play this title” (ONLY ever happens for the current episode I’m trying to watch, any other episode will load just fine). Also, I travel for work, so episodes downloading and actually working without WiFi is really important to me. Unfortunately this is not a thing with HBO Max. An episode will say it’s downloaded, but then when it’s time for me to watch it, it either won’t load or disappears completely from my downloads. Honestly I should probably give this 1 star, but I really like some of the shows and movies they offer. Got so annoyed that I cancelled the subscription anyway though."
2020-08-01 03:29:29,Welcome to the age of competition,5,Roncapo,False,"This review is going to be very simple, HBO has finally stepped into the age of streaming and on the go.  I find that with huge data bills with some cellular providers, the average consumer can not watch a streaming service on the(HBO go)service originally provided. If you can’t download something to your device, is it truly on the the go. ""Slow clap starts in the background which grows to a standing ovation""! Give it a try because like all or most of the streaming services on the market today, month to month is the new standard."
2020-10-09 02:45:01,Interface needs improvement,2,kate__#,False,"I would love to be able to see the title and episode description while playing on Apple TV by swiping down. And I despise that when my sleep timer or auto off turns the tv off, the app continually plays episodes and episodes until I don’t know when. When I return to the app to pick up where I left off, multiple entire seasons have played while the tv was off. Other streaming apps on Apple TV do not do this. It’s also really frustrating that the top menus duplicate when trying to go back and figure out where I was and I end up in an endless loop trying to get back to the home. Thanks for listening and I hope this helps to improve the app."
2020-05-27 16:25:11,Good for the most part,5,Jaylen's Group,False,"All the shows I’ve watched over the last 10 years are on here so I’ll be binge watching for weeks to months, this has all 7 Harry Potter movies. Everything on here is good. I do have a complaint about the amount of dc content you have. You have all the newer ones like Wonder Woman, Aquaman, and Joker but lack films like the dark knight and the old Superman movies which were promised at launch. As I do enjoy the Tim burton Batman movies I feel as the dark knight trilogy was the peak of the franchise so I hope in the next few days you add these movies."
2020-05-27 09:42:19,HBO Max just outstanding start,5,Darius305,False,"I have been a fan of HBO when I had cable that would be my go to bundle deal for everything else I was gonna need to see my favorite titles. Fast forward today now we have everything we could have ever asked for at your fingertips I love the interface could be a little faster when swiping through the screens but very intuitive. I can’t wait to take a deep dive into all of my childhood memories, movie and tv shows and exclusives this is truly everything I could have asked for in a streaming app. ☺️"
2020-10-17 01:21:30,Blank screen on tv,1,sunshine rebellion,False,When I try and stream from my iPad/ iPhone  HDMI to tv all I get is a blank screen with sound. This happened during the last update. All other streaming platforms work so it’s not the cable. Your support is a joke. I get a text from you support team answered all the questions then no response. Then at 11 pm at night I get the same text from the same person introducing themselves again asking the same questions on how they can help me. It felt like it was a auto response algorithm. I would have canceled my subscription earlier but was hoping for a update or word on how to fix this issue. Your support wants to question about my t.v. How could be the reason it  not working if I’m using a hdmi cord . This has been a total waste of money!
2020-09-05 12:25:40,Not exactly satisfied customer,3,smp51990,False,"Samsung TV app- You can’t select an episode from a list if it doesn’t save your place making you have to painstakingly fast forward through the episodes you already watched to get to the one you want. 

Also, the sound doesn’t work more often than not! It will repeat the sound it just played over and over again and then the sound will shut off. You have to physically leave the app and come back. Hit play. Then it will work again for a few seconds. Then it starts all over again. It’s virtually impossible to watch anything. Why even bother paying for this crap?"
2020-07-28 12:02:22,Connection Glitches,3,J.Dingus,False,"PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE fix it to where it stops telling me about my cellular connection about 50 thousand times while watching something. Yes, I am aware. The first, maybe even second time is enough. But when I have clicked “I know” 8 times within 2 minutes, it’s utterly revolting. And it keeps going on and on randomly. Other than that, I wish the interface would allow me to go back into shows without having to re-search the title or just go back to the episode I was watching. And other than that warning of consuming cellular data, I works well. Would be a better review if not for that insufferable warning."
2020-09-02 05:27:40,Awesome! but a minor suggestion,5,Soonwon23,True,"I love HBO Max and actually enjoy the content (especially Westworld which I recommend) so much! However, there is a suggestion that would make the experience even better - I would love to see a “skip intro” option! I always have to skip ahead manually every time I see the introduction song or recap of a tv series and its a minor inconvenience but really annoying. Aside from that though, the app is so aesthetically pleasing and beautiful, with a lot of enjoyable content that I have been dying to watch! Love it!!"
2020-07-20 01:07:18,Not impressed,3,TopherOH81,False,"As a part of a bilingual household (english/spanish) that have some family members that are not fluent in english language it’s sort of disappointing to find out none of the contents in the app have an option to watch with another language audio other than the original!, most of the cable services that offer HBO have the option to watch the content in the language you want to watch it, and considering Netflix and Disney+, offer multiple language options to watch their content I thought HBO Max was going to offer the same!, but unfortunately it doesn’t, I guess I won’t keep paying it for long!"
2020-07-08 03:46:27,Downloading is always an issue,1,ndaghed,False,"I have had this app for a few days and downloading things to watch function is not working. The past 2 evenings I’ve downloaded things to watch and the next day when I go to watch they are not there anymore. The first time it happened I thought it was fluke. Then it happened again the second time. So this third time I attempted to download a move again I waited for it it finish, made sure it was in my queue, and to double check decided to exit the app to check back and the movie is NOT there. It’s frustrating because I’ve attempted to download this movie so many times on this third evening and nothing works. As someone that needs to watch movies in the background at work this is a waste of a subscription."
2020-07-06 19:29:31,Incredibly good for version 1,5,krakencracker,False,"This app is new so it’s a bit jenky but that’s what you expect. It’s quality is belittled by the absolute quality of TV and movie selection. There is no comparison to other streaming platforms. It is stacked with amazing content from originals all the way back to classics. It’s a single hub for all the screen staring that you could want to consume. So who gives a F if it ain’t the smoothest app yet. 

-Also I’m not a secret rep for HBO I’m just an aspiring cinephile. I’m objective enough for example Netflix is another good service but people already know that.

Peace"
2020-10-20 21:35:15,Awful,1,THECHICKENNUGGETSAREBURNT,False,"I have a few complaints one of which is how AWFUL the app is made i mean it took me 5 hours to even be able to get into the app and it doesn’t even let you log in so I spent time for nothing and the fact that you make people pay 15$ A MONTH. For such a poor app is disappointing, i hope you make your app better and find someone completely new to re do the whole thing because it is NOT worth the money. I will gladly change my review when you 1. Fix your app 2. Start actually fixing problems. 3. ACTUALLY START TAKING YOUR WATCHERS ADVICE.
Also, what is the point of so many ads when we already pay 15$ just to use a poorly made app.

I am now going to keep adding to my complaints every so often just to show how  much is wrong with this app 😐"
2020-09-30 00:29:05,Needs an app update,2,Luthienxo,False,"There are far too many glitches in this app, especially when streaming from an iOS device to a smart TV.   Any time I let a show go fully to the end of the episode, I have to uninstall and reinstall the app in order to get the local network sharing working again.  I have to start the app fresh, refusing to share to local networks first, and then it will work once again.   At first I thought the app just wasn’t compatible with network sharing.  Turns out, it’s just glitchy.  I love the service and content.  It’s a shame it’s not compatible with an LG Smart TV so I could have a device centered app instead of being forced to use a wonky and problematic network share."
2020-08-28 23:55:23,Not compatible with fire stick or Roku,2,hayleyhch,False,"I just downloaded it on my phone and made an account. But then I go to put it on my tv only to find out it’s compatible and I’m unable to download onto a fire stick or a Roku device, which happens to be the only types of tvs we have. So I will only be able to watch on my phone which is very frustrating. Will most likely end up unsubscribing because I don’t want to have to just watch shows on my phone. And I’ve been seeing some shows and stuff that are coming out for hbo max that looked interesting, which is why I subscribed in the first place. But there is no point in having the subscription if I can watch it on my tv. Highly disappointed"
2020-07-20 03:41:29,Irritated,3,kellyj,False,So.... I was forced to take HBO max to replace my HBO now subscription. Now I’m loaded with a bunch of content that I didn’t ask for and I can no longer get a live showing of my television shows. I’ve been watching Last Week Tonight for years. It starts at 11pm but I can no longer watch it at 11pm. It’s after 1130 and it’s still not available. I’m very happy I was forced to this platform AFTER Game of Thrones concluded. I would’ve cancelled the service. The whole point of HBO now was that I could watch HBO LIVE right NOW. A ridiculous amount of content was added that I don’t need and you’ve missed the point of what the original application provided.
2020-06-28 12:38:01,"Good on device, bad for casting",2,Maksu1982,False,"I don’t often use this device to watch shows on so it’s mostly used for casting to my Roku which HBO made the incredibly stupid decision to not put their app on where I watch all my streaming services. In that aspect of what I primarily use it on its unwieldy, slow and a pain. It has drops in quality at times ( I have a 215 mbps cable connection constant and the latest iPhone so that’s not it ) and trying to access the controls every time I need to pause a movie or show by unlocking my phone every time and wait to show that it has a casting connection when all I want to do is use my remote is very tedious. It does its job but not very well hence the two stars instead of one."
2020-08-17 22:58:01,Very disappointed,1,Canyonmommy,False,"Considering how much the service costs I would expect the app to be at least comparable to other streaming services. In addition to things others have mentioned, the thing that absolutely drives me bonkers is when I’m downloading a show I have to keep my phone “awake” or I loose everything to that point. At the very least, if it can’t continue downloading in the background, it should pick up from where it was. Also if I leave the screen to answer a text or look something up I shouldn’t have to start all over again. I live off grid and my service is hit or miss, so when I have good service I like to download a few things for later. But the app requires you babysit it for the whole download."
2020-06-17 10:14:13,"App is great, but something confuses me.",4,dtx_anime,False,"So yes, this is a great app. It has great classic movies and new recent movies, but the one thing that confuses me is that it’s says that some movies are available until July 1, 2020. 

I’m wondering are they going to take the movies and shows off, because if they are I’m going to be highly disappointed I want to keep these movies and shows for the times I want to rewatch them. But know that I found out there is a time limit I’m a bit upset. 

Especially ‘Wonder Woman’, and ‘Us’. Can you please answer back to my review to explain some things a bit clearer than before."
2020-05-28 01:16:58,WOW 🤯😍,5,HoodiesOn,False,"I recently resubscribed to HBONow. And let me say that the transition from Now to Max has been so seamless and so smooth that you couldn’t ask for anything better. 

I love the “HUBS” feature and look forward to more of them for content that can be grouped. I also love the addition of all the classics like Yogi and Scooby-Doo and The Jetsons(!!!??) which I had no clue would be on here! 

So far, from what I’ve browsed and used of the interface, I’m extremely impressed with what WB/HBO/AT&T have put together with this. I can’t wait for more content and most importantly: THE SNYDER CUT."
2020-08-30 21:23:56,App terrible since today,3,Bob 64,True,"Barely works. I watch one episode and it’s just stuck on loading. Reinstalled. Rebooted phone. Removed sim the whole nine yards. Nothing. App is terrible on iPhone as of late. This isn’t the first time this has been happening.

I can’t see the develop response. But I’ll say after restarting my phone it worked. But it still happens. There’s an issue with playback and after leaving the app it does fully reopen to the episode it was on. But if you guys allowed backup app data to run I wouldn’t have to wait 2 minutes. Or the 6 minutes it takes me turn my phone off and on. Please help."
2020-06-20 03:14:09,Solid streaming app,5,Yumyum21,False,"The newest of the HBO streaming app and it comes with plenty of stuff to. The studio Ghibli selection is one I enjoy, tho they could do with more choices as they only currently have a fraction of the movies. The app on the IPhone on the computer are easy to use and visually appealing. They currently still support Now and Go however I would imagine they will eventually discontinue these as if you have GO you have Max  as well and possibly offer Max with adds for the price of now. 

Overall Solid streaming platform."
2020-05-27 18:46:00,Well Done HBO!,5,atxlnghrn,False,"First off, this app was well worth the wait! Being someone who is invested in the Apple Ecosystem, the application works amazingly on Apple TV.

I can enjoy the cartoons that I watched as a kid and so much more. I get this free through my cable subscription and had no issues getting it to work.

Ignore the people complaining that there's no support for Roku or Firestick. It takes time to roll out to multiple platforms. Also, the lack of 4K is not an issue. The platform just launched today, so I am sure that 4K content is in the pipeline."
2020-06-06 09:49:00,"Potential, but",3,AMN1202,False,"The app for the most part is decent. I have two technical issues with it. 
1) How do you turn auto play off. If there’s not a way yet it needs to be added ASAP. 
2) Like with HBO GO before it, the app has a tendency to drag when loading content. I used to think it was my connection but it’s not. 

Regarding content, for the price point I would have expected more content accessibility for the sister channels to be there. It makes it more compelling to keep if you know you can have a favorite niche content access and broader content overall. HBOMAX has the potential to be great but it has a way to go."
2020-06-01 20:53:01,Glitches galore,2,GailenNico,False,"I love that I can watch Friends again, but is it worth it on an app this undeveloped? It’s only available on mobile devices and can only cast to some other screens, but it can’t be downloaded on fire stick, roku, or smart TV’s. The shows glitch and buffer a lot, sound quality is poor, AND THERES no way to skip thru the intro like Netflix does. 

It’s definitely NOT worth the $15/month price tag. It looks, feels, and behaves more like a free app. Also that price is way too high to still have to sit thru commercials. Probably going to cancel my subscription unless they update it and make it downloadable on all steaming devices and as well as better sound and video quality."
2020-08-03 01:03:59,"Great App, Subtitles Don’t Work",4,G94758362,False,"I just want to say that the content on this app is absolutely amazing. So many movies and shows I’ve always wanted to see or never had the chance, or shows I wanted to see again that just disappeared (oh god how I missed Doctor Who). But, subtitles stopped working. They worked in the beginning, but then one day they just weren’t showing up. I had subtitles on. I tried closing out and going back in. Turning subtitles off and on. This app is amazing, but I kinda need subtitles to help me understand what’s happening over the sound of my chewing."
2020-07-16 02:10:56,"Love the content, hate the user experience",3,BraStrapDJ,False,"HBO has the best programming around, but what good is it if you can’t manage it or find it?  It’s also very pricey and would be nice if the app maximized you’re ability to enjoy it. Simply put, I don’t understand this user interface and it seems like a big step back from HBO Go.  There’s no ability to organize your preferences, no watchlists, no individual profiles, no way to set reminders for upcoming programs (based on trailers offered in advance).  They have a long way to go to catch up to the UX being offered by other streaming services, but I’m confident they can do it with some effort!"
2020-08-15 14:09:05,"Yep, content is solid, needs some updates.",3,3-Sev,False,"My biggest peeve with the computer/internet version is that when I put my shows on, I have to click it back into full-screen between every episode. I love to watch cartoons like South Park and Adventure Time (Adventure Time episodes are only 15 minutes) I set my computer up to my TV via HMDI and all is great except getting up every 15 minutes to put the next episode on full-screen. If you all could figure out how to just leave a show you are watching on full-screen because you are still watching it.. that would be amazing. I would easily rate 4-5 stars."
2020-06-07 17:24:11,Horrible Interface,1,Patrick16273,False,"I was excited for HBOMax to launch due to the new shows however, I’d gladly give up content for a platform that actually works. The sign on process just didn’t work. After typing in the password I had to trick it into actually submitting by hitting sign in and not done as that would grey out the sign in button. Then it told me to subscribe when I’m already a subscriber. I had to click a few declines only to be allowed to log into my own account. Then I had to select my profile multiple times. In addition the chrome cast just does not work... this is by far the largest flop for a platform ever. You had so much time to make this work and fix the bugs before the release. Hopefully an update is soon to follow!"
2020-06-07 17:36:32,It needs some work,3,AlexG419@,False,I’m excited for this app and what I’m sure they will do with it.(Syndercut)  Unfortunately right now it needs a lot of work. You can’t continue watching anything you’ve started without it restarting back at the beginning. One of my other huge issues with the app is that when you download a show it still uses data which defeats the purpose of downloading the show from the start. That being said I know that this app just came out so I’m sure they’ll fix this issues soon. I’m also very excited for the different plans that I’ve read AT&T has for this app going forward.
2020-06-28 18:34:40,Absolute trash,1,Smidy23,False,"DO NOT SUBSCRIBE TO THIS SERVICE. 
The customer service is absolutely trash. The fact my smart tv doesn’t support it was annoying enough. I got over that but then a lot of content I was hoping for was missing... or incomplete...for 15 dollars a month that’s inexcusable. The straw that broke the camels back  was how quickly they cancelled my subscription after my debit card got hacked and cancelled.  I literally had 12 hours to put a new card on the account. I could have accomplished this but they since they contacted me by email on a Saturday night I was unaware it was even an issue. They took away my promotional pricing and just said tough.  This has got to be the worst streaming service I’ve experienced yet, for the highest price. Makes no sense."

On my iPad, content will stream for a few minutes, but then routinely dies into a cycle of ceaseless buffering (I don’t experience this on other streaming services). I’ve found that the only solution is to download the content to my device. However, the app spontaneously deletes my unwatched downloads every few days, so I have to waste bandwidth to redownload whatever I happen to want to watch—and that necessitates planning ahead, which is counter to the concept of on-demand. Really frustrating!"

(Previously) While I am obviously online with a valid connection, my HBO Max app has been reporting “you’re offline” for three days now. All other apps working fine. Rebooting my ipad, updating the app, etc, have not helped. Disappointed in the fragility of this app. Netflix working great, though!"
2020-08-19 13:14:06,So Disappointed,1,🐣🐥🐣🐥🐣🐥🐣🐥🐣🐥🐣,False,"HBO shows are worth more than to be on this app! The app on a TV is slow, on my iPhone 11 it gets hot, all while offering ZERO features. There is no “15 second” ff or rewind, no FAST ff or rewind option, no way to “restart” and episode FROM the actual episode, the “continue watching menu” is ONLY the episode (you can not access the shows main page or any thing other than THAT ONE episode), there is VERY LITTLE info on shows/movie, no actors or cast listed, and no intuitive recommendations or even “more like this” listed. Oh, and I haven’t mentioned the crashing, at least once a day, always when using captions. ANY streaming app is easier to navigate and use, and this one COSTS MORE THAN ANY APP! So bummed out. The old HBO app funtioned better."
2020-06-01 16:09:00,Cost is way too much for an App that doesn’t include all content,1,Justanothercomplaint,False,"I have the same  complaints others are sharing, but I would also like to add that the App shouldn’t have been released until ALL contracts are signed with companies.  Because of the rush to get this out, I can’t watch this $15 a month App on my fire stick.   MAX includes all shows and my HBONow is limited still.  I subscribed to this for Friends and other specific shows and now realize the app cannot  been added to my fire stick or the Roku device because the greedy companies can’t come to a decision on their costs they want to pay or be paid.  You shouldn’t be charging the consumer your high-price if you aren’t able to supply the full product."
2020-10-08 10:43:10,Can’t watch downloaded shows offline!,2,Ntombi,False,"Please tell me the point of downloading shows (or movies or whatever) to my iPad if it won’t let me play the stuff when I’m not connected to the internet? I open the app, go to downloads, and I get a message that I’m offline, and should check the connection. There is no way to watch. Seriously? I KNOW I’M OFFLINE, that’s why I downloaded the media ahead of time! If you don’t want people to be able to view content offline, don’t offer a download option. BIG FAIL. 

My second big complaint is the same as a lot of reviews: I can’t select a different episode from the “continue watching” screen. Moderately big fail."
2020-07-03 07:10:37,Frustrated,2,thesybb,True,"I have never been so frustrated with a streaming app.  I have yet to watch anything without constant buffering, my internet is a fairly consistent 7.0 Mbps dL speed.  I have been (attempting) to stream it on my PS4 but constant buffering makes it impossible. I have deleted the app and installed it again and nothing changes.  Maybe there will be an update to fix this on the coming days or I won’t make it past the 7 day free trial.

I have a consistent 7.0 Mbps DL, the app seems to work well on my I phone however with the PS 4 app it does not work properly and I get consistent buffering.  All other streaming apps work just fine on my PS4, this problem only persists with the HBO Max app"
2020-09-02 09:58:11,Where are the movies going??,2,M0rgAn H0n3y BuN,False,"What’s incredibly frustrating about this app, that I’ve noticed, is the fact that you’re taking a gamble whether or not they have a certain movie or series. For example, the movie “Elf”. I know you’re app has it because I’ve added it to my list but now every time I go in to watch the movie it’s taken out of my list. And when I go to search up the movie title nothing shows up. This is frustrating for someone who just wants to watch a movie they KNOW you have. I’m fine with the app, it’s okay, but sometimes I want to watch a Christmas movie and I should be given the ability to do so when I know you have the movie."
2020-08-29 01:53:53,"Amazing content, really bad app..",2,Lexiiandria,False,"I love all the content this app has.. I’m a fan of a lot of the movies and shows the app has available to stream.. but the app is crap.. I honestly think they spent very little time at making it a good streaming app.. I keep going to the app store constantly to see if they put out a newer version.. the main problem I have with the app is that it buffers, ALL THE TIME!!! No matter what I’m watching.. And if that weren’t enough, it shows an error message on the screen and prevents me from casting anything.. I really hope these issues can be fixed because I really enjoy the content and I’m paying to watch it.. it’s getting ridiculous.."
2020-08-25 22:48:32,Thank God I didn’t Pay for This,2,Pepperpottz,False,"The app works fine on my iPhone XR.  When I try to stream it through Chromecast or Apple TV though, I get a message saying “there was a problem decrypting this video, please try again later.”  When I got to stream movies or episodes, the trailer part of it plays fine.  As soon as it’s time for the feature film there is an issue.  I thought the issue was being caused by needing a software update on my phone.  No.  Update the Chromecast maybe?  Still won’t work.  I’m very disappointed.  I have no issues streaming any other app through Chromecast.  I’m getting a headache trying to get this thing to work and it’s just not worth it."
2020-08-14 19:22:10,Watered Down,2,Pavicich!,False,"It has a few shows I would normally pay for HBO for(which there are not enough of now- I almost just subscribed but here is why not) but I was curious to the “Hubs” they offer of other networks. The hubs are watered down versions of the actual channels and do not have all(or even half) of the programs those hubs have to offer. If the DC and Crunchyroll catalogues were complete I would sign up but I’m already paying for them and you do not offer all the shows I watch or enjoy on that network.  When you step your library I might pay $15 for this, but as it stands now, just know what you’re getting before subscribing if you are attracted to the hubs."
2020-07-01 11:02:38,"Good app, broken voice search",4,c3o7l4,False,"It’s a good app. I can turn on/off subtitles without pulling down a menu. I appreciate the Just Added/Last Chance/Coming Soon sections. I appreciate that it doesn’t try to skip intros and credits. There’s plenty to watch. The only problems I’ve seen are a few movies that left that weren’t in the Last Chance section, and voice dictation for search doesn’t work on the AppleTV or iPad. On the iPad (model MP2H2LL/A, iOS 13.5.1, HBO Max ver. 50.2) dictation gives results, but it causes an error message, with no option but to restart the app."
2020-05-27 10:13:26,HBO plus a fantastic selection of grade A classics,5,lec0rsaire,False,"Really impressed with Max. The UI is modern and smooth. The complaints I had with Now have all been taken care of. The selection of classic films, both from Warner and Criterion is spectacular. 

The only letdown is that there is no 4K DV/HDR and Atmos support at launch which is disappointing but it’s easy to look past this given the quality of the content here. Hopefully it won’t take too long for titles such as GoT, Westworld and recent films to be upgraded considering that 4K HDR transfers already exist."
2020-06-10 00:57:52,This app needs some serious updates!,2,Amp45,False,"I would like to give kudos to the amount of content on the app. However, the experience of browsing is terrible. First the app doesn’t actually work well with Apple TV. When you add a show on up next not only does it not stay updated but it keeps trying to force me to use HBO GO (which is not on my Apple TV at all). Secondly, it really is hard to navigate. Trying to find a search button 👀 seems nearly impossible. Content is layed out to show what THEY want you to see first, not the content that you’ve already watched and want to continue to watch. 2 stars I told all this craziness can get refigured out."
2020-10-08 15:34:20,Necessary but could be better,4,AngryDaughter,False,"I need this platform to access Sesame Street for my little one and discovered other series I enjoy, such as South Park and Doctor Who.

My main complaint is the captions, whether on the app or the tv, just do not work after one episode. For someone who is hard of hearing and prefers captions over volume this is a huge disappointment. Exiting out of the episode and going back in does not work, you have to exit the app completely and then return to the episode each time for the captions to return."
2020-06-15 22:14:15,Max streaming,3,Airborne307,False,Nice work I’m so happy that HBO has joined the App world. Please note that there are some bugs. I was downloading a show to watch later off line. However once I started watching if I had to pause it or got interrupted by a call. Once I returned to the current show to continue. It would start over from the beginning of the show and not where I left off. I do like the option to download and watch later great job. If possible the streaming warning that comes up before view is it possible the have that agreement only once not every time you open the show or shows?
2020-05-27 17:21:58,Was good until....,3,KaoriVenna,False,"Was good until it updated to MAX now it says  it’s unavailable for my provider, but if I start a free 7 day trail it allows me to stream. So ridiculous, after paying for a full month already, I would have to cancel and re start back up again just to get the app to work. Tried contact HBO to trouble shoot and fix it but couldn’t get through ANY of their contact us links. Very unsatisfied. I only signed up for HBO NOW so I could get MAX when it debuted, I’ll probably just cancel it all in the end since I can’t access even HBO NOW anymore since it’s updated to MAX. What a waste of money."
2020-06-03 21:17:05,"Love the Library, Needs to be organized a lot better",2,bd_sean,False,"This is movie and content heaven. But navigating the app is very difficult. It would be nice if they organized their catalogue the way Disney+ has it organized by into different sections. I know if you scroll down to the bottom you can do that, but it makes navigating so much easier if it’s at the top. 
Also, the one thing that would make the app perfect is having a voice search function in their Apple TV app. Instead of typing out each there, this would make it so much easier. And lastly, switching between pages takes too long. Please make the animation faster."
2020-08-13 05:10:31,Issues,3,Grappa ucla,False,"Seems pretty buggy currently, sometimes it auto signs me out. This time it signed me out and when I was trying to sign in it says the app is having issues at this time I go to hit restore purchase and it somehow miraculously signed me in (without being prompted to enter credentials).Now I’m trying to download a couple of movies for my plane ride and I’ll click the download button it will flash and showed queued then immediately show the option to download again thus repeating the process. I’ve deleted the app and re-installed to see if that helped nothing does."
2020-08-25 10:00:14,"I love the content, but offline downloading is poor",2,mng_84,False,"I’ve tried multiple times downloading episodes and it works great in one go while app is running, but as soon as you close the app while it’s still downloading it’s either dropped from your queue or all progress is erased. This needs to be fixed. For Last Chance listing, a date of expiration would be helpful, and movie selection pages would benefit from a continue button. Continue Watching would also be helpful if it brought you to the listing page or season list instead of auto play instead of having to scroll and find the show again"
2020-05-29 07:07:26,HBO Max is not ready for prime time,1,boogie2172,False,"With all the hype and lead time to develop a quality experience, they dropped the ball on this one. The biggest draw for me was the ability to download programs for viewing offline, something HBOGO lacked but other streaming services offered. 

I downloaded several programs. Some won’t play at all. Others pause for no reason. You can’t resume from where you left off. And worst of all, several times it wouldn’t load downloaded programs without an internet connection. That is the ONLY point of downloading anything! 

I know it’s new, but AT&T’s (parent company) track record with video services tells me they won’t be in any hurry to correct these issues."
2020-05-27 14:46:55,Great but where are the other languages?,3,samgeeahh,False,"This is worth the money. We this during quite time because we all had the virus and couldn’t go anywhere: we’re still trying to isolate as much as possible. There are tons more shows and the Harry Potter movies?! It is unfortunate that there are no other languages available, not even subtitles. That’s one thing Netflix has over this. I know they had Game of Thrones in Spanish at some point because my dad watched it. But now he can’t rewatch it the same way. I hope they update this so we can keep it even after this is all over."
2020-08-31 02:51:31,downloads,3,bighbofan!!,False,"i download daily shows/movies to watch on my morning 2 hour commute. netflix is my “go to” for episodes, but HBO is preferable. But i cannot re enter a movie or tv show i download once i pause it to answer a call or check other apps! I get a notice that my connection is offline or unable to connect pops up. I don't have the pleasure of always using my at&t’s slow service for my shows. Is there a way around this that i am missing? HBO MAX is the only app that kicks me out until internet is turned back on. I see nothing in the trouble shooting."
2020-07-07 19:48:37,It is ok,3,hdhbrfhf,False,"HBO max has a wide range of shows and movies to watch but it is a hassle to watch them. It takes two minutes to load onto the app and to click on shows . You also cannot skip intros to shows like Netflix has, you have to do it yourself. Fast forwarding is also a hassle and you have one set speed for it . It takes a minute to go 10 minutes ahead. The app lags even though I would use other streaming apps and it would work perfectly fine so I believe it is the app itself. The layout is also a bit challenging too."
2020-08-17 10:15:27,It's great! Just some questions.,4,wolflover ROBLOX Is ThE BESt,False,"I really love HBO Max, unfortunately I can't figure out how to get it on my TV. Except the thing is, my account is set on age 8; that means I can't watch some Harry Potter or Justice League movies even though I've already seen them. HBO Max is a great source in finding shows and movies, just it doesn't have very good ones.

Questions/Suggestions: Is Upside Down Magic coming to HBO Max and if it is when. Please add more Animal and Wildlife shows. Please add LEGO Ninjago Movie.

I hope this was helpful to some, also thank you if you read this review!"
2020-10-06 23:29:16,Great content terrible app,1,DalexC,False,HBO is HBO and their content has always been great but for these people to make us get rid of the 17 apps they made us download and combine them in this one app that doesn’t have ANY of the features of the previous apps is down right stupid. You’ve been in the streaming app game for plenty of years and you don’t have auto play? No continue your series/ where you left off ( like the next episode is already loaded just press play)? No skip intro? No skip credits? No section for shows you’ve been watching ?  It annoying every time I try to use the app that I prefer to stream content using other services or watching HBO content via other sites  👀👀
2020-08-27 17:17:53,Same as all others,3,Lupe Lupita,False,"Tv is dead and unlike how TV guides use to inform us what was up and coming or being cancelled these streaming services ones we have little to none of that. HBO puts things in there existing section like all other sites yet they do not tell you what will be in there, why or more importantly how long you have to enjoy it. With that said hbo is still really good with new content giving directors writers a platform to tell/show their stories. 1 Star for no details on the expecting of contracts and two for the contents given to those of us paying."
2020-09-01 19:35:58,"Great viewing options, bad app",3,Gabs_00,False,"I love the viewing options provided on this app as well as the layout and overall mapping of the app. My HUGE issue is that the app just doesn’t work well ... on any device. It constantly slows as if there are internet issues, but I have 150 mbps internet speed and only 3 devices connected. Another issue that I’ve encounter is that the show/movie will play without sound, resulting me in having to completely close the app and restart what I was watching. I found these issues on both the iPhone app and the Samsung TV app."
2020-08-01 04:33:47,Doesn’t work all the time.,1,Jose Dirte,False,"I loved it at first! I downloaded it to watch Game of Thrones and rarely had a problem. Setting up to my tv was a bit of a pain but I got it going. This app only works when it wants it to though. I have TERRIBLE WiFi connection but I can watch Netflix fine. The episodes buffer every 5 seconds and it is literally unwatchable. It’s frustrating. The ui (user interface) is slow and just clunky. Oh and it works only when it wants too remember! If you’re considering paying for this, wait a little until they fix what’s wrong. There’s plenty of other reviews just like this and i hope this helps make your mind up. This will be my last month."
2020-05-28 03:08:33,"Good, but could be Better",4,MongoJustPawnInGameOfLife,False,"I pre-ordered this over a month ago and have been excited about this service for a while.  The amount of content here is staggering, with a not-very-impressive DC library (not a single Superman flick at launch? Seriously?). If WB found a way to put their heads together and integrate DC Universe’s content (which I pre-ordered and currently subscribe to) with HBO Max, I would legitimately drop all of my other streaming services.  Figure out what’s happening with DC Universe, then I’d be thrilled to come back and give this service 5 stars."
2020-10-10 06:02:50,Won’t play downloads. What’s the point?!,1,Nalmie,False,"For me it happened after iOS 14, but my boyfriend experienced this maybe a month before then. I download shows and movies so I can play them offline. I mirror my phone to the TV through hdmi cable  connected to an apple brand adapter and everything works fine up until I click play a downloaded video. The odd thing is sound will play but the screen will go black, it won’t even show hbo app after I click play. No other streaming app has done this so far. Other apps play downloaded content fine and I’m able to mirror them to the tv without a problem. This is the main use of the app I have. Please fix this."
2020-07-01 07:00:23,Who designed this?,2,Confidential1035,False,"Just like the regular HBO app, it’s trash. Can’t easily navigate back and forth or fast forward. All to often you hit back or just try to click a description to read it but it plays instead. When you click back and back again to see the other search options, it acts like you have to start all over. I mean, someone designed this and then someone approved this! I hope they are in the unemployment line soon, because this is pure garbage just like the original app. If the content was so amazing, I would have ditched this crap long ago, but HBO makes the best shows and movies around."
2020-06-27 15:47:27,Lacks Language variety,2,Kirby Cares,False,"I like how much content there is, but I’m very disappointed that there are no dubbed versions of movies. Although I am knowledgeable on the English language, my family only speaks spanish. If I where to watch a movie with them, they wouldn’t understand anything, and there’s no fun in that. I know there’s a “Latino” category. And you’d think “maybe there’s dubbed versions of movies in that category” but no, it’s just a small corner filled with Hispanic movies. 

I’m pretty sure y’all have the choice to make dubbed or AT LEAST subtitle versions of different languages, I’m just disappointed that you chose to stick with english only."
2020-05-29 13:47:15,"Good app, needs improvement.",4,Ira Cogan,False,"It seems streaming is the default setting even with downloaded videos.  In order to watch downloaded videos I had to switch to offline mode otherwise I get a message telling me to find wifi or change my settings to stream over cellular. Anyway, when I put my phone in offline mode, the downloaded videos work play just fine. It’s not a “huge” inconvenience to put my phone offline to watch downloads, but it is an inconvenience."
2020-06-06 12:59:30,Confusing Sign In Experience From Apple TV Channels,3,Forest10W,False,"It is confusing to figure out how to sign in and use your Apple TV Channels HBO account to access HBO Max. The sign in page is buried under TV providers. Once you start the sign in flow the forms do not interact well with the iPad keyboard. For example, they do not auto populate with your Apple ID and password and the keyboard is constantly dismissing on each field, which makes for a painful sign in process.

Then I’m forced to create an HBO Max account when I’ve already signed in with my Apple account. Why?

Please make the sign in process easier!"
2020-06-07 12:07:54,Hijacked,1,FoxFyre001,False,"They changed their app, and now I cannot access HBO, I cannot access my account, I cannot cancel HBO, AND I CANNOT GET A RESPONSE FROM MY REQUEST FOR HELP AND TO  DISCONTINUE HBO. I’m so disgusted with these arrogant people who seem to have total disregard for their customers. I use an iPad and if they didn’t know whether their ‘new’ system would work, they should never have pushed it out to the public. I know this will be hidden and no one will see it, but here it is anyway.   

UPDATE:  reloaded HBOMAX to try again. Sure enough a few shows came up but would not allow me access eve after I signed in. Told me it was not supported on my device. SO WHY HAVE YOU LOCKED MY DEVICE INTO THIS ‘NEW’ APP WHILE TELLING ME TO USE THE HBP NOW APP?  Are you really THAT STUPID?"
2020-09-03 16:47:41,Good Content. Video Issues,3,Gabriel Bahamonde,True,"I’ve had some troubles watching the videos because of my problem with the captions. I like all the content you have in the app, but I’m practicing my English and I still can’t watch the videos without subtitles, that’s why even though I like the app so much I can’t watch the videos cause’ I don’t understand them at all. I really need your help to fix this because if I can’t fix it at the end of the next month unfortunately I’ll have to unsubscribe of the app. I really don’t want to. I hope you can help me with this."
2020-05-28 23:53:42,"Wow, such junk",1,Hanna866,False,"Well thanks for taking yourself off of my streaming platform without any notice. I only find this out after 15 minutes of trying to just get to the sign in page. I can’t believe that the hbo website can’t even make a link on the page that’s supposed to help you sign in. Instead I had to read through a bunch of jumbled nonsense of directions trying to tell me what will and won’t work. Oh well, I only liked you for John Oliver anyways, I can find a stream somewhere online and save myself some money and the headache of dealing with a company that is out of touch with their customers. Ending of GOT blew anyways, your company deserves to lose customers."
2020-05-28 02:51:18,ATT login not recognized,1,GwenNH,False,"What good is Day 1 access if I get told “can’t verify login”? Went through all the steps including refreshing cache and resetting password, HBO Max still says it can’t verify my account through ATT wireless. My ATT TV login for free HBO still works but I can’t access HBO Max using the same login info. Called ATT and confirmed my unlimited data has it included. Stayed on hold for an ATT tech rep for 40 minutes. Never reached a live person so I gave up trying to get this resolved. I took a screen shot of my current plan on ATT which states clear as day “HBO Max Included” just in case they try any funny business. With all the emails and texts I received stating I would have access on Day 1, this crap is pure BS!"
2020-05-27 19:07:17,Typical Streaming Playform,4,B-Blogit,False,"Typical streaming platform.  Lots of black, user friendly.  Only let’s you have 5 user accounts.  Adult accounts and child accounts.  Child accounts have ability to choose movie and tv ratings, with PIN lock to switch accounts.
I couldn’t sign in with my DirecTV account on the app until I first completed the sign up on a desktop and refreshed the app on my phone.
Seems as reliable as other streaming apps so far.  I like it and look forward to viewing more content."
2020-10-14 19:43:06,Not user friendly,2,wishfulshopper32,False,"It’s very annoying to have to search a show to go back episodes of the show I’m currently on. It freezes/buffers a lot so working on that issue now. Also having to stream from my phone causes issues of it not always mirroring if I walk away with my phone and come back. It may have kept playing and my phone is no longer on the same page or responsive so I have to disconnect and close out everything and start again. Sometimes a few times. I like the selection they have, but buffering over 20 times in a 22 min show is pretty lousy."
2020-09-13 14:20:04,AirPlay erratic,2,WM Houston,False,"I have to use this app to watch HBO Max via AirPlay on a 2020 Vizio TV because there is no HBO Max app available for the TV. AirPlay works fine for other apps on my iPad, but it is erratic with the  HBO Max app. I successfully watched a few episodes of “Raised by Wolves” yesterday, but today it does not work for other episodes of that series. Yet I can watch the film “Dirty War”.  “An Angel on My Shoulder” worked the first time I tried it, but now will not play. “Young Sheldon” played successfully when I first attempted to watch, but won’t work a few minutes later.  I have no problems with content from the Apple TV app playing via AirPlay on the same TV."
2020-09-11 18:23:56,No app for tv,2,fourteetwo,False,"Great content but app won’t stream to tv. Tried mirroring, casting, and Airplay. It worked once and then hasn’t worked since. App is updated. Tried deleting and reinstalling. Still get same issue. All other video apps work as expected except this HBO Max app which requires to Airplay/cast to watch on tv. By having it continually error, I’m stuck watching on small screens. Tried on iPhone 11Pro, iPad 6th gen, 4K Apple TV and get same results with same failure. All powercycled, same network, all updated, etc. Once it can stream again and not give errors, it will be more enjoyable. Please fix or advise of other way to resolve."
2020-05-28 01:28:00,The Way a Modern App Should Be,5,MilkdotWhole,False,"The new HBO Max update was much needed. Prior to the big update, trying to navigate HBO Now was an absolute nightmare on Apple TV and iOS. You were better off using the Apple TV app to find and continue shows on HBO. This update fixes the spotty user experience and I’m proud of Warner to fix it.

The content is so much more worth the asking subscription price. $14-$15 to watch Game of Thrones, Succession, all the old Batman movies, and best of all... SAMURAI JACK?? Definitely worth it. Thanks Warner!"

Also I click on something to find more details and go back it takes me back to the beginning of the list vs keep me where it was. Also would love a better system for finding shows. Hbo content would be better if it wasn’t mixed in with everything else.  Maybe I’m still new to it, but I had hbo before this and I want to see the new stuff"
2020-07-11 06:38:32,Great but needs work,3,Jnc71125,False,"Love that I can watch friends and quite a few shows from my childhood, but they really need to fix the fact that it won’t stay full screen between episodes. I travel for work and watch on my laptop on my bedside all night long and it’s a bit annoying having to click the full screen button every episode. It’s been about 2 months and there still hasn’t been an update, I know there are bigger fish to fry, buuuttt I think I can speak for a lot of us when I say that we’d LOVE this small change."
2020-09-02 07:04:54,Recent update is buggy,1,Camelhive,False,"The recent update introduced bugs that make using the app a pain:

Popping out the video stops it, and continuing to play is thereafter buggy and difficult to manage. The video should switch seamlessly between pop-out and full screen.

It is no longer possible to jump back from an episode to the entire series, there’s just no link to do this. Tapping the “left” button (with the series name on it) brings the user to the home screen, instead of the entire series. In the previous version, it was possible to tap the “Sxx Eyy” link above the episode title to go back to the show page, but this is no longer working."
2020-07-24 03:08:02,Spoiler Alert!,2,lilodeboy,False,"Honestly, I’m not a major fan of being forced to leave HBO Go, an app that I was using for 8 years, and having to transverse to another brand new, bug-filled, glitchy app, with more content than I asked for. 
That is what I was afraid of with HBO Max. 
But even worse, is that I feel like the descriptions of some of the movies, illustrates far too much information than is needed. I want a summary of the movie, not a detailed description of what happened! 
The summary of the movie, “A Perfect Murder” is a perfect example. 
I like the idea of HBO MAX, but I miss HBO Go, with the short and sweet movie summaries that draw me in instead of spoiling the whole thing."
2020-07-13 18:09:53,Good Navigation but Poor Audio,4,MikeInRI,False,"AppleTV app review.
I feel HBO Max has a lot of content to offer and is a fantastic upgrade from regular HBO. The navigation didn’t change too much with the switch to Max. But, compared to Netflix, the audio is horrible. I have to turn the volume up 20% higher compare to Netflix and even then the dynamic range isn’t that great. They need to stop doing their audio so compressed. If I have two movie choices of equal interest I usually pick something not on HBO Max due to the poor audio."
2020-07-05 02:15:45,So mad with this app,1,Kpmelgar,False,"I’m so mad now to watch a movie I can use my data I have to use Wi-Fi why plus I have my TV connected I got the application in my TV and I cannot find the same movies in my TV just in my phone how is that even possible I even have updated the version on my TV I just hate this this is why I’ve been unsubscribed to a lot of applications because they start with all this dumb thing with Wi-Fi that is the reason why I got this app because I don’t have Wi-Fi in my home I live in the middle of nowhere do you people should realize that not everybody live in the city just waste my money this months for this......
Never leave bad reviews but right now I’m so upset with this.."
2020-10-21 02:43:29,Don't waste your money,1,Flump W0bbler,False,"Every time I try to use this app on my TV, it either streams without sound or doesn't load at all. This was happening a while ago with game of thrones.. I could get it to work about 25% of days, the other 75% I had to go with Netflix. Now months later, trying to watch a show on here for the first time since then and what do you know! No sound and/or will not load. I am cancelling this terrible service and getting my money back. 

PS: no, it's nothing to do with my internet or TV. I have tried EVERYTHING other times this was happening. Just had to come back the next day and hope HBO was going to give you what you pay for."
2020-07-05 23:01:33,"Good Content, UI Poor, No MyList for Apple TV Device",2,MtrMaid68,False,"As the title indicates, HBO Max has great content, BUT the UI is clumsy at best and the functionality has has yet to come to maturity. I feel as though the app is somewhere between a beta and ready for release. 

My complaints about the UI and functionality is not different from those that have all ready been mentioned by many others about this app and subsequent feedback exchanged with developers. So, I won’t repeat them here with one exception.

Would like to point out the Apple TV app (Apple TV device, service accessed via DirecTV) does not have MyList. At the top of the screen: Browse, Search and Settings—no MyList. The iOS app has a MyList, but not the app for the Apple TV device. Hope that this will be remedied in the near future as I would rather not have to keep a written list of what I want to watch and then have to search for each program every time I use the app. 

Hoping the app will vastly improve in future."
2020-08-15 05:32:40,User Interface Not Intuitive,2,eric12345678910,False,"Which makes me wonder why, because all they would have to do is take notes from Netflix and adapt it and make it better. Why on earth would you not be able to see all episodes from where you view one episode to easily switch to watch another? You have to go back like two screens. You’re telling me none of you seriously thought about that? How many people did this app go through that gave that the green light? I seriously didn’t even want to write this review because it gets me mad thinking that I’m doing their job. Get better."
2020-05-29 23:32:11,"Avail. on Apple TV, Fire TV, Nvidia Shield, iOS etc",5,WILLxLOVE,False,"This has been available on all major platforms for awhile. It’s a growing but handful of new releases, with a few choice quality new additions to the “HBO NOW” content in an a slick streamlined interface. 
The win here is the quality of what’s on offer. It’s not a bunch of B movies overdubbed in English. It’s all considered top quality movies and tv. With the growing content of exclusives it’ll only get better. It’s only monthly. Try it yourself."
2020-08-13 06:41:53,Great Shows Awful App,2,Just another joe shoe,False,"I had previously used HBO Max on my smart TV and had few issues. The interface is ugly and clunky but I had no issues. 

The app has the same ugly and clunky interface but with a slew of issues. It takes 2x the bandwidth to stream a show as Netflix does. When Steaming from 4G I often have to give up on HBO and switch to Netflix. HBO does a bad job packaging the data. 

Additionally, downloading shows for later does not work. They often remove themselves from your library once downloaded or reset to 0% once they are fully downloaded. I spend a great deal of time away from internet so I like being able to download my shows for later. It’s not possible with HBO MAX. I have only ever been able to successfully download 1 episode of 1 show in the last month. 

The selection of shows is great and that is the only reason for 2 stars. 

The app is awful execution and is by far the worst of any streaming service."
2020-07-05 09:24:28,Good service,5,bobthefunkofanatic,False,"It is a really good service that includes lots of movies and shows old and new. It movies such as the goonies, spongebob the movie, godzilla and the LEGO movie 2. I also enjoy the studio ghibli films on the service. I like the Cartoon Network section of hbo max,I just want more to be added. Also the Hanna Barbara catalog is good. It also has good shows like the Big Bang theory and we bare bears.  My only complaints is add the LEGO movie, the LEGO Batman movie, and the LEGO ninjago movie and they should add a section for Hanna barbera."
2020-06-15 23:36:33,Family Sharing?,3,Manon_ee,False,"Maybe I’m missing something, but I can’t find any information on how to enable family sharing with the Apple family service. My husband is paying for this service and I’d like to be able to watch stuff on my iPad, but it doesn’t seem to work? 
Bigger issue is lack of information and support content overall, I’ve spent 20 minutes looking and haven’t found anything from Apple or HBO on how to use/setup the app, just a lot of media articles.
Agree with other users, content is great, but interface is meh."
2020-06-30 07:55:31,Apple TV app interactive problem,2,FrankAppfan,False,"The Apple TV app’s interaction is a mess. The menu button’s mapping is different from any other app I used. You cannot resume playing by pressing Menu button when you’re swiping through the timeline. Also, how can each episode get its own page and can be add to watch list individually? It is so confusing. The subtitles of new episodes of Last week tonight with John Oliver are delayed in playback. And the search function on Apple TV is still completely broken! Who has time to scroll through 26 letters? We need dictation and being able to type on iPhone!"
2020-10-09 22:55:20,Great Company but buggy App,3,TTT.......,False,"I’ve been an HBO user for some time and I honestly think that for premium content they compare to none- I appreciate them for this but I think they’re let down by the app at least the iPhone version. I tried changing my password and it kept freezing. I can’t imagine that for a simple task as changing a password could be so frustrating, I checked and there wasn’t any update for it and that’s even more crazy. It’s a buggy app and it needs to be updated. 
Great content but the app needs work. Thanks"
2020-06-12 02:40:31,Disappointing all around.,1,Channing Wong,True,"Really wanted to like this, but there’s too many problems. First off the interface is horrible. The biggest sin would be the streaming quality. You can tell there’s much more compression and noise, audio cutting in and out with just plain HD. Just figured out that older movies don’t have the 5.1 track. Why is Batman in HD but with stereo? My old batman DVDs have a 5.1 track. Can’t even get the basics right. They advertised such a deep pool of content, well you can’t get that here. Want more DC? You have to subscribe to that. Want more anime, you have to subscribe to that. Expensive, low quality, shallow content, and they drove the guy that made great content over to AppleTV+."
2020-10-20 02:00:22,Doesn’t work!,1,+Unthinkable+,True,"Tried to watch 3 shows in the past month and each time it played a few minutes, paused a few times, then displayed a screen saying “Can’t play title.  We’re having trouble playing this video.  Please try again later.”

I tried.  Multiple times.  On various shows.  At different times.  On different days.  Monday at 1:30 in the afternoon HBO MAX won’t stream a movie.  A documentary on a weekend evening won’t play.  ABC works fine and I’m not even paying them anything!  Pay $20 a month, and HBO tells me I should want to watch sometime later, not now.

HBO MAX demonstrates exactly why streaming is such a bad idea.  This NEVER happens with DVDs or OTA television!"
2020-07-29 06:54:25,TV show never stops playing,3,34534653356,False,"Love the app besides the fact that that my TV show continues to play all night. I wish HBO Max would update with the similar feature as Netflix where it asks if I want to continue watching. When this message would pop up it would be great because my show would stop playing and my iPad would turn off if I was asleep. Instead of waking up to it still playing in the middle of the night or morning and seeing future episodes. Please consider adding a feature like this. 

Thanks!"
2020-10-04 07:19:21,No longer works with chromecast,2,IanC89,False,"Title says it all. I own 3 chromecasts and have the same problem with all three. This is a recent development as it worked before. I can click the cast icon and the purple HBOmax screen comes up, but then the app won’t play anything I click on. It’s like the screen on my phone just doesn’t recognize I’m hitting the play button.  I can watch content on my phone and then click the cast icon and this also fails to play via TV. Since I use chromecast to watch HBOmax on my TVs I’ll probably just cancel my subscription. Hoping this gets fixed by the next update."
2020-05-28 04:11:53,"iPhone app great, PS4 not so much.",3,Los.91,False,"While I understand this is a review on the Apple App Store, this was the only way to provide feedback to HBO Max developers regarding the PS4 app. It is very laggy and I took a long time to add all movies to my list just to find out there’s no section on the user interface to expand the full list. So I only have access to view the 20ish most recent things I added. That is a problem that needs to be addressed.  Auto play next episode as well as skip intro would be amazing and is currently lacking on that interface."
2020-06-01 21:53:35,"I love the service, but now I can only watch on my iPad",1,Reev0,False,"HBO decided they were going to save money and not put an app on a lot of devices, to include Roku (which is how I watched HBO Now on my TV).  According the their support pages, all Samsung SmartTV after 2016 should get the app, but my model is having mixed results (with it working for some people but not others).  HBO needs to get their act together and provide the same level of support they used to (and the same level of support their competitors provide) or else there is little reason to have the service.

The iOS app works fine, but there is no syncing between HBO Max and the devices still stuck on the older HBO Now."
2020-05-27 14:26:13,Very good launch,5,ebannnnnn,False,"This app has what I think is one of the better catalogues when it comes to streaming apps. It’s worked well the last fee hours and actually has profiles, unlike HBO Go and Now, which is a welcome change. I have one very minor complaint however, I think the video player needs to be updated to something resembling Netflix’s or Hulu’s where you can double tap to skip and rewind. All in all, a successful launch."
2020-07-12 18:12:11,Amazing content. Terrible streaming.,2,Equipo Tigre,False,"Best content by far in a streaming service. The streaming itself, however, is frustratingly horrible. Can’t go longer than 5-10 minutes without it needing to buffer. On average it takes a solid 5 minutes to continue playing if you let it figure itself out. I’ve taken to hitting the 15 sec rewind, then pause and play. That seems to kickstart it. But it continues to happen. Makes watching things a task since I always have to be ready to nudge it along and can’t just sit back and enjoy. Hope it gets fixed with an update or something."
2020-10-14 16:49:25,Requires New HBOMax Account,1,andrewaltogether,False,"To be clear, I subscribe to HBO Max and have an account which I use on computer (though it doesn’t work in all browsers). When I open the app and tap Sign in with Provider, it takes me to the Create an Account page. If you do that, none of your saved shows or progress or settings are retained. They say you can link accounts, but they assume it’s easy and will always work flawlessly, which means it doesn’t work well at all. This, plus the segmentation of HBO into different services you have to buy? TV is back to the dark days of Cable. Except this time it’s going to be even more expensive and confusing."
2020-09-24 17:44:08,Can’t get the basic functionality right!,1,InvinciShan,False,"I don’t know who developed this app but they’re either underpaid and it shows or Warner Media is flushing money down the toilet on this developer. 
Here are my issues:
1. The app doesn’t work with cellular data even when it’s enabled. Keeps giving me the prompt to enable Cellular in video options. 
2. App doesn’t recognize the downloaded episodes and you need to actually go into the Downloads section to play a downloaded episode. 
3. Playback ends after playing each downloaded episode. You have to manually play the next downloaded episode and there’s no Autoplay for offline playback."
2020-09-21 20:08:27,Your service is broken,2,Gun seven,True,"How long has HBOMax existed? Several months now? You’d think a cash machine like HBO would be able to utilize technology that isn’t completely broke or at least they’d know how to fix it. But since launch this app is broken and doesn’t even work fifty percent of the time. It’s an exercise in frustration where it’s the most expensive streaming service where you pay to not watch anything because it doesn’t work at least half the time. Pull your heads out of your greedy corporate butts and deliver what we pay for, you miserable incompetent morons"
2020-09-19 02:06:58,Parental Controls Completely broken make it unusable,1,crsouser,False,"Parental Controls broke so most content I pay for is inaccessible with “Title Blocked” and no prompting for the HBO Max Pin, the apple tv restriction pin , nothing... just blocked blocked blocked.
I have parental controls on my AppleTV setup to 12+ and I can watch hardly anything on this App because the parental controls are completely broke. It locks you out of all content and does not even provide a pin override even on “Max User” or  an adult profile setup in the app itself.. no way to get around it but completely disabling restrictions. 

This is NOT something I have to do in Netflix, Prime,  CBS or anything else for that matter.. if restricted content is accessed. 

Ive also made multiple reports of this on the Apple Feedback app and the developer has done nothing and it has been weeks. I wonder how many people have dropped HBO or had kids watching adult content on HBO due to this major bug.. so incredibly irritating the developers and HBO fail to act."
2020-06-07 08:19:20,Horrible Interface,1,brandoff818,False,"Such a glitchy app. They literary had the better part of a year to create this app and we get left with this garbage at $15 a month. Try adding a bunch of content to your List and then watch everything constantly disappear. Even better is when you re-add stuff, it don’t disappear, but only the most recent 10 “adds” show up. Then, when you click “see more” to view the rest of your content, the app recycles and takes you back to the home screen. So good luck having to remember all of your saved content. It’s a blast after a long exhausting day. Not that I’m surprised. AT&T owns HBO and they’ve always been garbage."
2020-06-03 00:53:15,Best of HBO and more.,4,Anime Nut 2000,False,"I have to say when I download the app last week, I was very much impressed with all the content that was available.

I can watch the entire Studio Ghibli library as well as some of my favorite Cartoon Network show such as Steven Universe and We Bear Bears just to name a few.

However my only complaint is when I switch HDMI ports from my Apple TV to my cable box, when I switch back to my Apple TV, it automatically plays my show where it left off without touching my remote.

I don’t know if this is a glitch that others are experiencing, but hopefully this will be resolved with an app update in the near future.

Over all a great service for the money. The only thing that would top this is using the HBO in space logo from the 80’s as the start up screen, that would be awesome for old and new users alike."
2020-09-19 22:44:55,Very nice selection of content,5,Brysonperidot215,False,"I love how much content and how diverse the content is on this app. It is very nice to have it all organized by the original source (HBO, Cartoon Network, etc.) as it makes browsing for content easier. HBO Max is great for animation lovers like myself. I’m glad that AirPlay works so seamlessly with the app. 

Please get HBO Max as an app for Vizio TVs though, because I’d rather not have to always use my phone when watching HBO Max on my television."
2020-05-28 23:52:59,Make em stop please,4,Iphonester,False,There is no ability to have this turn off auto play. If you fall asleep on the first episode expect to have this sucking bandwidth ALL night non stop. Other services with don’t have auptoplay of at least stop after a period of inaction every couple episodes. Also please make it work with the space bar on iPad Pro 2020 magic keyboard. And advance and go back 10 secs with the direction keys. Nice selection of titles for the price but it needs to take advantage of keyboards.
2020-09-25 22:47:26,Language options,3,aguacatero,True,"Once again. I loved it,  but there is no choice at all to find Game of Trones in Spanish. I used to have Direct TV and watch it in Spanish. I got a feed back from you guys in my previous review about this issue. Still  it wasn’t helpful at all about what I’m looking for. There is no way to watch some series in English in to Spanish like I used to do it on Direct TV. Would be wonderful if you guys fix this issue. For sure you guys will get more Spanish speaking people get this HBO Max and will get more profit for you guys. Thanks"
2020-05-28 18:43:14,Audio Glitching,3,alee_umf,False,"I’ve been watching a show on my iPad (I can only access HBOMax on my phone/iPad/computer, which is an entirely different annoyance/issue), and I got to episode 5 when the audio started glitching! It cut out maybe 5 or so minutes in and then started playing random audio from a previous episode. I’ve closed out of the app and re-opened it multiple times and this keeps happening. It could just be this particular episode, who knows, but hopefully whatever is going on gets fixed soon."
2020-09-06 08:07:26,Download option is useless,2,Sin Dios,True,"The app gives you the option to download content, but won’t even open without internet access; so forget about watching anything on an airplane. Tried on two flights. Even turned the phone off/on. And for some reason, it won’t let you organize your list. iPhone 11, latest iOS.
UPDATE: After latest update I was able to watch one downloaded episode on a flight, but the app wouldn’t let me play another episode I had downloaded. I closed the app to try again but got an error message every time I opened the app."
2020-08-10 17:31:31,"Great Content, Meh Features",4,drewjb25,False,"I love the content, and it’s the good service, but it’s missing a good amount of stuff. The big one for me is no Roku support, I hate how it’s not on it. Other issues are lack of 4K, lack of recommendations (I know, I know, you do handpicked stuff instead but like.. could you at least put a row or two of recommendations?), and the features you said would be coming out soon, like Recommended by Humans (celeb recommendations), dual profile watching, etc. Still, I recommend!"
2020-06-30 00:44:21,Terrible.....,1,CarbonX,True,"I cannot unlink my HBO Max subscription from my AT&T Wireless account that I canceled due to terrible service in my area. I contacted HBO Max to get it unlinked or to get the account deleted so I could use the service. Easy right? Nope..... HBO Max was not able to help so they sent me to AT&T to get it resolved. AT&T wasn’t able to help so they sent me to HBO Max. After about half an hour each with reps from both parties, I gave up. When they get it together, I’ll try the service again. AT&T really took on too much when they purchased all these assets. Not only is their wireless service in the garbage, everything else is going down the drain with it.   Get it together."
2020-06-25 10:07:47,Great but needs work...,4,-rzero-,False,Occasionally deletes downloaded shows or movies on its own before I get to watch them and have to re-download if I have time to do so. Also for shows that are series it would be convenient to have the ability to choose to watch more episodes of that show from the existing screen rather than having to search or type in the show every time I want to watch that particular show. Otherwise great app with great catalog.
2020-10-01 17:42:31,Really enjoyed it when it worked,1,iphone user KM,False,"HBOMax has great content. We really enjoyed the DC movies and shows, Studio Ghibli movies, TCM and our little one loved the Sesame Workshop programs. BUT the app is buggy and recently stopped working with Chromecast, so you’re stuck watching it on a smaller device, which isn’t great if you want to watch something with friends or family.  Customer service won’t help beyond telling you to reinstall the app. (Which doesn’t fix the issue). It’s frustrating. UPDATE: Just lowered this to 1 Star. It’s no good if you can’t use it and after repeated attempts to contact  customer service they have not responded in any helpful way."

This way, it doesn’t keep playing all night. This is something that really needs to be addressed!  Perhaps I’ll change my rating after that is fixed.

Update:  found another thing that needs to be fixed. My daughter downloaded some things on her iPod. She cannot even open the app if she isn’t on WiFi. Please look at some of the other apps and fix this stuff. If she downloads something, she should be able to watch it off WiFi. Otherwise, why bother downloading?!"
2020-06-25 15:24:40,Not User Friendly,2,Still Wild Stallion,False,"This app requires an internet connection even when you’ve downloaded a movie or episode to view in a low or no signal area. The graphical interface is lacking, always making you go through multiple screens to get to where you need to be. When you want to view what you’ve downloaded, the app should have a button solely for downloads and when you are in that section, the app should understand you want to view what is on your device, not stream from the server that you cannot reach due to your location."
2020-10-09 02:46:39,Cartoon Network!,5,thesuperkiller,False,"So I downloaded this app originally to watch Steven Universe since I didn’t want to watch it illegally. I was fine with making a subscription and continued to watch Steven Universe, after watching a few episodes I found out there’s a bunch of Cartoon Network Series on this app! I got excited I watched Steven Universe, Clarence, Adventure time, Regular show, Uncle Granpa and We Bare Bears. Overall this is a complete success! Thank you so much HBO Max!"

I just want to watch my shows and can’t do that because no one will help
2020-08-20 13:23:58,Please Fix The App,1,kylie.olsonUWGB,False,This app is the worst streaming app I’ve ever used. It crashes constantly. Tells me “can’t play title we’re having trouble playing this at this time” EVERY TIME I try to use it on air play or even with an hdmi adapter. There isn’t an app for the the television yet which is also annoying bc I don’t want to have to use my phone every time I wish to watch something then I have to deal with the app crashing if I do want to view it on a bigger screen. It’s so frustrating I’ve been thinking about cancelling my subscription until it’s fixed. You have a wonderful service the crappy app is ruining it. FIX IT!

The kid profiles are great because there’s a password for it for the kids can’t see or watch the adult movies when you create it it asks you witch rates you can watch like tv-y or pg that stuff. But it’s not that great if your kid knows the password. I totally recommend this app.

2020-07-16 10:35:11,Streaming series could be easier,3,Kojirō,False,"Enjoying the content. Please make it easier to choose any other episode of multi-episode or multi-part content from any given episode. Often when watching a show, I get distracted or fall asleep and if I want to go back and review content I’ve missed, I have to go back to the home page and search for the show again to find the episode I want. Also, it would be helpful if the search bar automatically showed most recent searches."
2020-07-07 19:47:42,"Great content, app is designed poorly",2,ChaseTheAce8,False,"I love the content on HBO Max, but the app is very irritating when trying to find exact episodes of a series you are already watching.  Also, there is no double tap to skip or rewind feature, instead you have to use the buttons in the bottom left of the screen when you have the full UI when watching a movie/tv show.  Whenever adjusting volume, it brings up the full UI instead of just a small volume bar at the top. Like I said the content is great, it’s just the app is poorly designed in my opinion."

We finally got in. We have an LG tv and apparently the app is not available on that. We also have Roku and the app isn’t available on that either. So then I tried my phone. I see all the content, but it says I have to download each show or movie that I  want to watch? Is that right? Why do I have to download everything? Will it take up space on my phone? Why doesn’t it stream like Netflix or Disney? Am I doing something wrong?"
2020-06-11 08:50:35,Not worth the money!,1,@mike....,False,"They say “Turner Classic movies” but all of 15. You would think everything played on TCM would be available... Nope! You would think every classic western, war, or black and white movie would be a  must. Its selection is 1% of Netflix unless you want musicals.

Their search feature is trash. Even when you do search, it can’t just give you what you are looking for or genres, but give random content. Search “john Wayne” you get a few movies but then Sesame Street, Veep, watchmen, Westworld etc....

This is almost as bad as Disney+.... for $15/month, haha! yeah not worth it! Netflix has a better and bigger selection of content, I don’t know how."

Not good. Poor planning. They never should’ve launched and promised a product that leaves huge swaths of its consumer base locked out. Again, love the content—if only the business end was good at its job then maybe we wouldn’t have TV content that people can’t watch on a TV. The executives really botched it on this one."

When prompted it said to hit the (already am a member), that just to hit click that & that I would Not Be Charged! Free Streaming!!! That’s what the Text Said... Can you please tell me if this is Legit or Not? Thank You!!!"
2020-09-08 20:27:15,"Great Content, horrible app",1,VirginSturgean&theUnusedBagels,False,"Everyone knows HBO. Besides being a household name in entertainment, they host modern shows of all genres. People love HBO for the awesome movie selection and amazing original shows.

I cannot login with this app. Or on my tv. When i got the app finally working through my PS4 (all on the same TV and the same wifi mind you) it somehow magically works fine. This is a problem. 

Again, I like the content and am interested in enjoying HBOs product. But their delivery applications make it nearly impossible to even view their shows/movies. 

HBO cant get an app writer, coder, development team that can actually do their jobs. It doesnt matter what device, what generation of device, or even the internet connection, HBO apps never work for me. HBO Max is just HBOs latest failure. They couldnt get HBO GO to work. Or its predecessor. Now they unveil this monstrosity. Please fix yourselves before HBO becomes the Comcast of the entertainment world. 

There is great content. Just be better HBO"
2020-06-11 02:28:45,Good but needs work...,3,NadiaNadee1015757,False,"App overall is pretty good. I’m enjoying rewatching GOT. 🙂 

Few suggestions that I’m hoping are already in the works:
1. When you go back into the app on your phone to finish what you were currently watching, it only shows that one episode and then extras and sneak peeks. There’s no way to select a different episode without typing in the name of the show and going through the seasons to select the next episode. 
2. Please speed up the fwd/rwd feature. Trying to rewind an hour long episode back to a certain part or skip ahead to a certain part takes entirely too long. 
3. Please include a Skip Intro option and Play Next option at the end of the episode so you don’t have to back all the way out and scroll through episodes to get to the next one. 

Other than that I’m really enjoying the app so far."
2020-08-07 20:22:58,This app should be improved for people like me who rely on voiceover,3,iliveinatunnel,False,This app is not voiceover friendly I have not been able to access this app far as using it and another problem when it comes to signing in it doesn’t work I have HBO max included in my phone plan and not able to use this service at all a quick suggestion there should be a way where you can sign in on the app using your AT&T phone number I think this would work out much more better
2020-05-28 02:14:13,The app is broken,5,teamtdog,False,"So I am trying to sign in to my account and it gives me an error message. I realize that it’s only day one so I try to watch on my ps4 pro. Turns out that did not work either. HBO max, can you please fix these issues soon before my trial is over. Don’t get me wrong I love the service but, with issues like these and no fire tv or roku app I don’t know if I’m going to keep your subscription."
2020-06-01 22:33:45,You could do better,3,beandino0869,False,Is this HBO or some new company that just started to have a streaming program? HBO could do better with the layouts and tiny little details that helpful for viewers. Excited for Friends and all the Ghibli Studios. But not because you got everyone hooked on those and they don’t care about the app’s performances. It is part of the watch experience after all. Do better please! Make my $15 worth it. You’re HBO after all. Or have I been giving you too much credits this whole time...?!?!
2020-07-15 02:10:23,Needs to cast but ok,4,Stoner_link,False,It’s ok has some bugs here and there but it is a new app. The continue watching section doesn’t seem to let you pick an episode so a little annoying when I fell asleep and want to go back a few episodes. Another is it needs to add being able to cast from your phone to other devices connected to hbomax or even over WiFi connection like other streamers long apps. Other wise tho it’s pretty smooth
2020-07-26 01:15:56,A few things wrong is why I gave 2 stars.,2,PooPsWell,False,"First the app cuts out during movies and won’t come back to the spot if cut the movie out at. Sometimes you can’t even get the movies to play, it just keeps loading. Second when watching a show and the next episode comes on the screen blacks out. I dig HBO but when I am paying for an app on subscription, I expect to have have problems with it. If they fix what is wrong I will change my rating but as of now it makes me angry and I find it highly unprofessional for a major pay cable network."
2020-07-19 04:51:29,Hello 👋,5,allison alvardo :3,False,"look ima jump to conclusions.. I may don’t have the app but I watch it on my tv so all I’m asking is.. PLEASE PUT STEVEN UNIVERSE FUTURE ON THIS APPP 😩😩😩 pls? HBO max is a wonderful app and I’m surprised u guys have the walking dinosaurs on this app I used to love dinosaurs 😁 but any way pls read this and pls do this?

Future so I’m counting on u guys to pls do this                                  Goodbye! And again pls read and do this"
2020-07-12 12:13:35,HBO was the greatest thing ever.  This isn’t.,1,DanVT,False,"Where HBO had loads of high quality content and incredibly unique series and stories, the additional content added by HBO Max is loads of athetic and unsolved shows, where finding entertainment is like a needle in a haystack.

For now, I just go to the HBO section most of the time, but the app seems fully intent on mixing these disparate content sources together into some disgusting and repulsive media jambalaya.

If you enjoy picking at the carcass of old and expired attempts at entertainment, reruns, and the memory of HBOs greatness, than this overpriced app might be for you.  Just don’t forget to cancel, this is not a place for new content."
2020-05-28 05:46:18,LOL,2,Akawin,False,"6 originals. 6. And I have 0 interest in watching any of them 😂. One is Elmo hanging out with the Jonas Brothers and then you got some low budget looking reality shows and Anna Kendrick going for the paycheck. The rest is ancient TV shows you see on replay on late night basic cable. No 4K? What are you guys smoking over there??? My guess: tried to pull a Disney+ with the stay at home crowd but this sure ain’t to Disney+. HBO is a winner. Always has been. But man, this is weak. Hard pass, stick with “basic” HBO (which is all you’ll use in this app anyway). Prove me wrong, HBO. I beg you, because this looks pretty sad."
2020-06-13 16:05:02,No Siri search,3,bats64,False,The app is ok. All these streaming apps are “special” in their own way but it’s functional. But I don’t understand why they use a non standard search UI. You have to use the remote to scroll through letters. The standard search UI used by many other streaming apps is much better. You can dictate a search or use the remote on your phone to type with a full keyboard.  It doesn’t make sense that they did extra work to have a worse experience. Very odd design choice.
2020-05-27 12:30:51,This is a great place to find all of your favorite shows and movies,5,Slenderbag94323,False,So I’ve been using Disney plus for quite some time which is awesomeness so when I saw hbo max bring some films and shows from CN hbo and others I was shocked it blew my mind so I was really excited and yeah I can literally watch anything from these channels so this was probably your best idea hbo and Warner media I hope a lot of People enjoy it as well
2020-09-29 09:37:45,Disappointed,1,ixlekzi,False,"The selection is awesome I love friends , Big Bang and fresh prince! 
HOWEVER! I haven’t been able to watch going on two days now the apps on both my smart tv and Xbox one says connection error and can’t connect . I tried downloading to my phone so maybe I can log in to see if it’s subscription mess up on my part but I can’t even log in at all!!!!!! I thought it was because of my password but I do the reset password like 3 times but nevvvver get the email!!!!! How you expect people to pay for something they can’t watch or even get access too??? Guys really need to get this fixed!"
2020-09-09 23:05:45,Connection issues,1,Anthony_56_,False,"The content is great, but it is heavily out weighed by the poor performance of the app. I use the app with a Chrome Cast to stream content. Every time the app is used it disconnects from the casting device and takes several minutes to reconnect. This completely prevents users from pausing and rewinding content. Additionally, when you do use the back up 15 seconds feature the app either crashes or buffers forever. Finally, I use the same chrome cast with several other apps and this is the only one with these issues. Therefore, I don’t think the chrome cast is to blame."
2020-09-03 02:56:32,Please fix Captions issue on IPhone,5,dte232627,False,"I can’t turn on the caption while watching on my IPhone. Captions work fine when I watch on Apple TV and Smart TV, but not on my iPhone . I tried delete the app and downloaded again but still doesn’t work. Even after the newest update it still doesn’t show captions on my IPhone. I’m using IPhone 11pro right now . Thanks. Love the app ."
2020-08-19 03:14:26,Horrible! Don't waste your money!,1,expressionsbyjess,False,"The app is not available for Roku. Screen mirroring is no longer supported, you only get a black screen with just sound. Tried to use a laptop to watch, it works for only 10-15 minutes then the sound goes away and I'm soon left with a message saying the video can't be played try again later. That's bs. I have wasted three hours trying to watch one 40 min episode of PLL. For $15 a month the app and the webpage should be much better than it is. I am extremely disappointed. I have never had more trouble with a streaming service than I have with HBO."
2020-07-28 16:40:52,Consistent sign in issues,1,TruthIsImportant15,False,I’m still shocked at HBO’s inability to partner with AT&T and not address sign in issues. It is still a boondoggle to sign in via a provider account and does not work. It’s clear they want to drive anyone getting this with a mobile plan to pay them directly for a monthly subscription. In an era so saturated with content I would think they would put more emphasis in letting people in to view their content (people who have authorized access...like people with qualifying mobile plans). This was an issue with HBO GO and apparently continues to be something they don’t care about. Sad.
2020-07-27 07:34:53,Nothing new,1,The Big 1000,False,HBO Now/Max/Go I wish this company would get it’s act together and offer a streaming service worth paying for. Or they should team up with a streaming service that knows how to stream content! They need to hire me to make their decisions and focus on making content! Content=A. Streaming service(s)=F. Their recent failure of an app doesn’t work with firestick. So I can’t watch the same things on my TV as I can in my phone. So it’s completely worthless as I would rather stare at the wall than watch a movie in my phone. Unless I’m on a 13 hour flight! I have tried all of HBO’s apps and been left with a bad taste in my mouth
2020-07-19 08:55:36,It has potential to be great,2,amm202020,False,"I was so excited to see the titles HBO max had to offer that I subscribed to this service immediately. However, it became very clear that it is not there yet. Why am I unable to get this app on my firestick or roku? 

Even on my iPad or iPhone, my biggest complaint is downloaded content. I have things that are shown to be downloaded, but when I try to watch them it just buffers. This is my second time being a subscriber because I was so frustrated but I will most certainly be cancelling until they figure it out!"
2020-06-01 05:07:49,Disappointed,2,Breazer125,False,"I was super excited to be able to watch my favorite shows again, until I decided to move from my living room to my bedroom and realized the app is not available on my tv upstairs. How can such a large company only have it available on certain TVs?! We have a Roku TV and we cannot get it on there, nor can I stream it from my phone to the tv. I would HIGHLY recommend you check to see if your device has the app available before paying for the service, otherwise you will be upset just like I am."
2020-06-01 01:17:49,HBO Max versus HBO Now...what’s the difference?,1,Ana Nanci,False,"So I just got HBO now a month before this app came out. I didn’t oh much mind to it because it was the same thing nor did I think it would affect my subscription to hbo now. But long and behold I can’t sue the app because I have hbo now. Can someone please explain to me...wth is the difference. It’s HBO in general, why screw over current customers that PAY for an HBO service wether it’s like me or thru their cable. It’s the same thing. Now I can only watch anything hbo on my web browser. If you have hbo now. Do not update it. It will turn into the max version and won’t let you watch anything."
2020-10-17 13:19:20,"Great content, terrible execution",3,riley111111,False,"I read the reviews when I originally downloaded HBO but i thought with the large number of reviews cover in app issues that some of them would of been addressed already. Boy was I wrong... it seems next to impossible fast forward or rewind anything more then the 15 sec skips. Only seems to be working with Apple TV which is garbage. All my other streaming apps work with my Chromecast, i even tried another stick and it still didnt work."
2020-10-04 18:13:24,Closed captioning,3,CharlietheTiefling,False,"So before this new update if you turned on subtitles, it just stayed on until you physically turned it off. Which was ideal for watching a series. But now it has to be turned back on for every new thing you watch. It’s so inconvenient when watching a series, you can’t just let it play through and there’s no way to keep them on. Really hoping this gets fixed. Especially because this is the only place I can watch friends!!"
2020-09-08 00:53:10,Good selection but very slow,3,jtrip06,False,Great selection but holy moly is the app extremely slow. Takes forever to launch and if you’ve been signed out and have to sign back in it takes unnecessarily long and just sits on the loading screen if it even lets you sign in at all.  All of my other streaming apps work perfectly fine so I really don’t think the problem is on my end. When it takes a half hour to get signed in something is clearly wrong.
2020-09-17 22:21:55,Where’s the HBO quality in this app?,2,meeeangie,False,"I love the content. HBO certainly rocks, but this is app is just not at the same level of quality. The user interface is bad. It freezes and is so slow. For instance, to search for an episode of a series you’re watching, you have to search for the series because there’s no way to check all episodes from home menu or on the episode continuation). Not user friendly and intuitive. 
I wish HBO could invest on creating a better app so we can watch their awesome content in a better platform."
2020-06-25 14:42:42,Good selection but still need some work,3,BlackMoonDragon,False,"I am really impressed with the selection this app has but there is currently one thing that is preventing me from subscribing. Personally, I think that there should be more options than just a monthly plan. I can’t speak for other people, but I personally don’t like paying monthly plans and would really like it if they had a yearly plan. If they had a price I could pay to get a years worth of subscription, I probably would subscribe."
2020-08-22 13:30:05,App is trash and they know it,1,cheese burger deluxe,False,I was given the promise and promotional pricing to watch free for 30 days. I downloaded the app on my iPhone and Apple TV. I followed the directions and it still would not let me watch anything at all. So I canceled even the free subscription. This was back in July. Now I got charged for it and had to log in just to cancel it again and request a refund. Then get the reply via email that it is a one time courtesy to me to give me my money back and it will take up to 7-10 business days. Which could be another month or so. Smh don’t bother with the app. It’s obviously a scam!!!
2020-08-06 22:18:29,No mirroring or roku!?!!!,2,Ninsixnic,False,Pay for direct tv with all the premium add ons and several other popular streaming services and now if I’m at my office or another property I have to pay for another hbo subscription to watch on roku? This is ridiculous and outright thievery!! It’s bad enough that you can’t mirror but charging again to play on roku goes beyond greediness. Watching on small phone screen only seems hardly worth having app so you can just track and sell my data for the few things I don’t mind mainly just listening to on my phone. Shame on you HBO!
2020-07-11 19:34:30,What a waste,2,patrick739,False,"I have downloaded, streamed, believed and more and yet this thing just doesn’t work. Gobble up a bunch of good movies and shows they executed well but then I can’t watch them for $15 a month. Downloaded movies don’t work when you’re even connected to WiFi and the whole point is they’re supposed to be free of WiFi needs. Try to watch a movie while sitting 3 feet from the router and that doesn’t work either. Get it together champs because you have 23 days till my subscription runs out and I’ll never download it again."
2020-06-23 21:59:34,Some episode glitch problem,3,Hytrscghhgfxdfnnhhfdggvh,False,"While I am enjoying the HBO Max app, somehow I’m experiencing a episode glitch with the show I was watching called The Amazing World of Gumball (a show that I used to love watching all the time on Cartoon Network) and as I got to the episode “The Procrastinators” right as the intro was about to finish, it all of a sudden brings me to the first episode of the show. I don’t know if the glitch is a problem with other shows available on the app but I hope it gets fixed on a future update."
2020-09-01 01:21:14,Tentative 2.5 stars,3,palex222,False,"Glossy graphics are not a helpful addition if it's at the expense of every other UI feature (or lack thereof). 

I don't want to see newly available on your platform. I want to see 'New in My Stuff'. 

I will re-watch a stand up comedy special, bur do not want to see one I just watched suggested, or their old stuff interspersed with other old stuff I've explored, out of chronological order.

I want 'continue watching' separate from 'my stuff' (which should be recommendation fodder), with sorting options. This must include a ""watched"" and rating function. Gonna make it difficult to find anything I like? I'd rather read. 

Ideally a formerly coveted premium service would provide stuff I want AND a pleasant experience. I would settle for telling you what I want (and you deliver) OR you streamline browsing options."
2020-06-14 18:42:46,Great Streaming Service But...,4,ferrisprescott,False,"HBO Max is a fantastic value prop but my disappointment is really that it wasn’t its own app. I use to have HBO Now and when I no longer needed it, I hid the app so it stopped interfering in my Apple TV app. I was shocked that when HBO Max released it was just an upgrade to the Now app so I could not enable the Family Sharing to allow my kid to download the app. Outside of this issue which is a bit of an iOS and developer issue I’m loving Max. Please add more DC content."
2020-05-28 02:04:20,UNDER THE REGULAR STREAMING SERVICE 😔💔,2,waltwhite_,False,"I’ve been a huge fan of HBO since 20 years ago because of the quality of the content, I was exited to give it a shot once it’s streaming service become available. Unfortunately, it has not 4K and/or HDR support, the absenteeism of subtitles and language audio tracks make it a weak service against competitors; taking on count Disney Plus offers Dolby Atmos and Dolby Vision, on top of the options for subtitles and audio languages tracks since the launch date. So disappointed about the lack of important features for a worldwide brand in 2020 ☹️💔"
2020-05-27 15:44:20,Same Old Quality-No 4K HDR,2,LiZZARD23,False,"The app works and the content is there. The streaming quality is the same old HBO GO or Now quality. Meaning not great especially compared to other services. We have the same blocky H264 codec being used, with the same crushed blacks and smudged brights. A large swath of the new DC content is available elsewhere in 4K HDR, while some of HBO’s own content is available elsewhere in 4K as well.

HBO Max is the most expensive service to not offer 4K HDR content, and putting something on a roadmap isn’t a selling point. Implement it now since you want our money now..."
2020-09-30 08:56:09,Glitchy/ Needs work,2,Eddie1199,False,"I love this app and the content, although I do have a few issues with the way it works. Mainly the fact that when casting content on the app from my iPhone to my TV, if I turn off my phone or jump to another app and then back to the HBO Max app, somehow the app stops showing that I’m casting content -even though the content is still playing on my tv. I then have to disconnect the cast and reconnect so that I can continue to have functions like pause and volume controls display on the app. So annoying. So simple."
2020-07-15 22:46:26,Works but has bugs with Chromecast,3,Amgdmbski,False,"The app is designed better than HBO Now and has good content. My major issue with the app is its functionality with Chromecast. HBO MAX no longer ‘speaks’ with GoogleHome, which is not the biggest problem. BUT what is a major problem is that fact that EVERY-TIME anything is streamed to Chromecast it eventually no longer connects. And HBO MAX will not re-connect to Chromecast, until i shutdown my iphone and restart my iPhone. Nothing else has been found to correct the issue."
2020-06-19 20:06:45,Constantly glitching,2,HilDuffFn1,False,"The content available and coming is worth five stars itself. The problem is the app continuously glitches. Casting to a smart tv, the content pauses to “reload” every couple of minutes. It also throws the feed off, not allowing the content to air on the tv in full display. Tried downloading content first before casting to see if that was a solution but it comes up with the same result. Extremely frustrating when trying to watch new content and you can’t even see half the screen."
2020-06-23 10:57:15,Can’t access what I paid for,1,PatrickDF,True,"I’d rate this if you had not removed access to those of us that subscribe to HBO now!  Why would you create a replacement app that doesn’t allow people who are paying you a subscription to access said subscription?  Why delete the app that worked for us and then say “this isn’t available through your current provider”. My current provider is DIRECTLY THROUGH HBO.

Edit to add in response to your comment: there is nothing “more” to tell you via email, you know the problem, there are many other posts about it. This is horrible customer service."
2020-05-30 14:31:57,Different language tracks missing,2,Random -_-,False,"I thought HBO Max would finally add different language tracks for their shows, that are missing HBO Go and HBO Now but are available if you have cable. I was wrong. Not even HBO Max original content is available in different languages. Which makes it so half my family cant fully enjoy the shows. Netflix original has different language tracks, Disney Plus has different language tracks Apple TV Plus has different language tracks, why cant HBO Max have any? Unless they add that option ill skip"
2020-10-01 13:16:42,EVERY APP/SHOW DOES THAT! Sorry but change is needed.,4,moonpieyumyum,False,"This is a very great app but overall...... it mostly just steals your money cause you have to pay for almost EVERYTHING in the app. But it’s a great app so I recommend it if your fine with losing your money. And I love the colors it’s so spacey and cool! However did that is smart! But anyways I love your apps have a great day! Oh, and please make it a bit cheaper and I also was trying to say whoever but it corrected me."
2020-05-28 22:48:19,HBO Max is Awesome!!!!,5,Breezy243,False,"I love HBO Max much better than old HBO Go and HBO Now! It have old TV Classics series, Max Original, I love Looney Tunes cartoons, DC Universe, so much more! There is no problem for me to use (CC) closed-captioned and apple devices & PS4! I hope someday will add Nintendo Switch, & Roku. Hey I suggest to feedback to add HBO Max profile name with icon or avatar, like Movies Anywhere do that. I’d still give 5 of 5 because HBO Max is so awesome and keep it up to better and much better in future!"
2020-07-03 06:32:43,Too much buffering,3,juicy j homie,False,"Got so excited for this app! Love the selection, including the classic movies from tcm is HUGE! Always wanted a streaming service to make an emphasis of classical movies and you guys did that thank you! HOWEVER you must fix the constant freezing up and buffering in episodes and movies. A twenty minute episode of fresh prince takes thirty minutes because it freezes up like six times in one episode! Please fix that! I promise I’ll give you five stars when it’s fixed!"
2020-08-17 02:45:38,Content is the only good thing,1,hpb1995,False,"I was so excited about the titles I’d have access to with HBO Max, but the experience is horrible because of this app. There are a lot of international titles and the language controls don’t work. Casting is inconsistent and disconnects often. The download feature doesn’t work, so you can’t watch anything offline. The interface isn’t intuitive at all. To top it all off, every time I’ve reached out to customer service I’ve had a bad experience with them as well. Really wish that they had done a better job with the service. I really wanted to like it!"
2020-07-28 23:00:47,Great subcription service!,5,Silver-X,False,"What a great service! HBO Max gives Netflix a run for its money, it’s amazing the shows and movies available to watch, i started the 7 day trial and was amazed by all the content available, also by how good the app runs on all my devices, (ios, xbox, playstation, mac safari web browser) i just had to stay!.. keep up the good work guys i totally recommend it!"
2020-07-15 03:56:01,Laggy App,2,Jefforee,False,"I have a new smart TV, and 100mbps internet. I try watching this from my TV, from my computer airplayed, and now from my iPhone 11. The app takes forever to load, buffers often, and exits altogether frequently.

I’ve looked at many HBO forums, and there are many others with these issues. HBO support consistently attributes it to slow internet. And consistently, others point out that their other popular streaming services don’t experience the same issues.

The content is great. The delivery is buggy and needs attention."
2020-09-16 12:32:37,Great content bad pricing,3,LASflores2006,False,The content in the app is great but I feel as though there should be a free trial of a month or two and you can cancel anytime I love the content in your platform it has the classics lots for peoples childhood the only problems is the amount of movies is seriously lacking not having much to offer but besides that you are amazing the price is a bit high especially since others offer the same for 6$ a month which is better
2020-06-10 17:13:34,Meh...,2,mr. negative ------,False,"The TV Shows and Movies are great! I love how you can download shows and movies, but i have a few concerns. First, on the iPad app, you can scroll left and right and it hides some episodes on TV Shows. Auto play doesn’t work great, it is usually 30 seconds late, and there is no skip intro function. Also, if you have a keyboard, there are no functions that you can use (e.g. Space Bar = Pause/Play, Arrows = +or- 10 seconds). Also, on my iPad, whenever my iPad is on mute, the sound from HBO Max Doesn’t come out. I have to unmute my iPad, and then it starts playing."
2020-06-10 05:49:08,Disappointed,2,PhillipoftheFuture,False,"No 4k hdr support.

For advertising Snyder Cut and making such a big deal about it you don’t even have Man of Steel, which starts the story, or the extended edition of Batman v Superman, which you’re essentially spending money on making one for Justice League... it’s just odd.

You have Harry Potter. Cool. But we’ve all seen them and own them. Imagine if it was the extended editions! Not just 1 and 2 but also 3-8! It’s been done before on broadcast freeform, abc, added deleted scenes back into 3-8. Something you cannot buy! Imagine selling HBO Max including Harry Potter the extended collection. You’ll make a lot of money I’ll give money for that. I’ve wanted all 8 extended versions on Blu-ray for years and I’m not even that big a Harry Potter fan. So imagine!

Love the looney tunes cartoons old and new. Very fun to go back to the first ones ever.

You removed Gone with the Wind. That was a big mistake. Sets dangerous precedents."

I keep having this issue and it’s frustrating because it defeats the purpose of having individual profiles all together. 

Otherwise I love the content and interface."
2020-10-09 02:53:23,Doesn’t recognize chrome cast half the time,3,plebwholived,False,I love the app and the content! The only problem is I can’t cast it to my chrome cast cause the app seems to ignore the one in my home. When I click on the cast option it says it’s listening for a pin? I got it to work once by uninstalling and reinstalling but since then I haven’t been able to get to cast on my tv again. I really just want them to resolve this issue and then it would be a perfect streaming app.
2020-07-24 05:56:47,Closed caption doesn’t work,2,Michelle Ascanio,False,"I really love all content that HBO max has, but I have a few complaints. It only works correctly on the webpage, which bothers me because I don't always have a laptop with me. The closed caption doesn't work on the iPad/iPhone, and I don't know why you haven't tried to solve this, because it is essential. Also, you don't have an app for ROKU, so if I want to watch a movie from my tv, I need to connect a computer, and it's annoying. You should get your service better for it to worth paying 15$ per month."
2020-06-25 06:22:08,Actually really good and a growing collection of Anime,5,Migeelpv,False,I get this app through ATT and there is a nice selection of shows to choose from. I really like all of the Ghibli films and am liking the growing collection from Crunchyroll. I am actually surprised by the good selection of Anime the app has ( although still not large enough to replace other services). I see big things for this app in the future.
2020-05-31 02:46:14,Several issues with language inconsistencies,2,Vezor,False,"Currently, I am working my way through Doctor Who season five using a lightening cable with my iPhone to cast it onto my tv. Now all episodes on the season worked fine this way except 10 and 11 which were playing in Spanish I believe. But as soon as I pulled out the lightening cable, the episode played in English just fine. It’s a strange bug that, if fixed, I would love to write a better review. Also one of the episodes was cut a few minutes short of the end."
2020-05-28 14:13:17,Disappointed,1,Jhockersmith,False,I was super excited when I pre paid for the subscription. I was going to have access to my favorite shows and was planning my binge session. I have a Roku tv and can’t watch HBO max. This is ridiculous why release a streaming service and not be available to people who have roku or amazing devices. I’m not about to sit on my phone to watch these shows when I paid good money for a tv that I’d rather watch it on. I even tried to screen share and it wouldn’t work. Really contemplating canceling my subscription until they get it together and get hbo max on ALL streaming devices.
2020-07-21 05:02:34,Great but not the best,3,JaneIrving31,False,"There is a wonderful selection of content , but I guess the My List feature bothers me the most . What’s the point of it being an option if you can’t see what you save . 

The app also constantly crashes on Apple Tv
. This streaming platform has great potential, but it needs to improve on its design , layout , and functionality. Also it would be great to have a more tailored experience. I’d like to Get the most of out what I’d truly like to see ."
2020-08-15 00:57:01,Love this app,5,PinkyPie1977,False,I highly recommend this app! I got a 30 day free trial not thinking we would really use it but turned out the whole family loved it. Our son and daughter kept asking if we were going to keep it over and over again b cause they loved it so much. App is very easy to use and has wonderful content for everyone’s likes.
2020-10-19 03:46:10,Won’t cast anymore,2,Working Mom Gamer,False,"I really enjoy having access to shows I want to see on my phone when that’s the best option for viewing, but the ability to cast to our television just stopped without explanation. We aren’t having issues casting with our other apps, and online, lots of people are having the same problem we’re experiencing with the HBO Max app. It’s much harder to move around and watch the show on my small phone screen, so I’d really appreciate being able to cast shows to my television."
2020-06-13 03:54:09,Ads and not on Roku,1,BigbangtheoryDeprived,True,"I was really looking forward to being able to stream Friends and The Big Bang Theory (along with the TCM content!). I wasn’t expecting COMMERCIALS before each episode (almost every single episode), especially because they advertised their program as “Commercial Free”.  I was also hoping to watch these shows on my Roku. Apparently that’s not possible. What a waste to have a TV in each room to have to sit and hold my iPad or phone, where only one person can see it. When the ads disappear and I can watch the content on my Roku, I’ll be happy to leave 5 stars."
2020-05-30 16:56:12,I LOVE THIS!❤️,5,AA1908,False,So i was looking for friends but i could not find it but one day i Found HBO MAX! And when i looked inside i found all sorts of things AND I EVEN FOUND FRIENDS! This app is so so cool i love it. I think we all Need this app because sometimes in netflix or anywhere else you watch your things might not have what you are looking for but this app Has what you are looking for download now!!!! 🥳❤️
2020-05-27 22:29:52,So good so far.,5,RebeccaV28,False,"So far it’s a good app, I’m happy they added some of the Cartoon Network shows on there and Adult swim shows for everyone. Hopefully they’ll add more shows on there, along with other animated movies on there as well. I actually like to have Ed, Edd & Eddy on the Cartoon Network collection and other CN shows on there. Thank you very much HBO Max, hope to see more shows and movies you will add soon. 🙂"
2020-10-03 23:07:42,This app is horrible,1,StephKesh,False,"I love the HBO content, but this app is the bane of my existence! There so much I want to watch, but I get so frustrated with this app that I have to walk away before I throw my iPad across the room.
The 2 most frustrating things are not being able to skip the previously/intros and the fact that when I watching something (I cast it), if I go back into the app the program progress is gone. Just poof, disappeared. So I can’t pause, stop, go back, nothing without stop casting then go back in. When I have to do this, all progress of the program is lost. So annoying."
2020-10-01 12:45:25,"Great content, atrocious download experience",3,Omorgma,True,"HBO Max has great content that can be downloaded; however, accessing the data is regularly a nightmare. HBO Max handles downloads worse than all of it’s primary and secondary competitors in the streaming services market.

With no internet access, the files are frequently inaccessible even if downloaded minutes before trying to access the file offline.

Unlike other streaming services, HBO Max is get the entire file in one attempt or lose the entire download. Finally, the app tends to show something is fully downloaded when it actually has a few more steps to take before it is fully downloaded (and if you close the service... download lost). 

All of the above should be easily mediated to improve the app."
2020-10-02 19:32:27,Constant interruption,2,lizcooper,False,I generally liked the HBO go app. I also really appreciate HBO Max his new content platform. But what I really don’t like is the fact that when I’m trying to stream some thing on my phone and interrupted every few minutes to warn me about cellular data usage. Maybe having a single notification at the beginning with an option to change my settings would be helpful but when I’m trying to just watch a show or movie being interrupted constantly is unhelpful and annoying.
2020-08-15 06:06:19,"Good content, bad streaming",2,Marcpp889,False,"HBO streaming is very poor in basic things compared to any other service. Every time I decide to watch something I know is going to be painful. You need a lot of Internet, most shows have only audio and captions in English, the “continue watching” is useless and annoying (it still says I’m on episode three of a show I finished), it has errors when downloading. They should adapt to the audience that pays instead of making people struggle to watch shows on their phones or computers."
2020-05-28 03:35:22,The App is Slow,2,Logan27267,False,"The app is quite slow, slower than the CW app! The animations are choppy and the loading times are long. There is a lot of content but the app makes it troublesome to search. I think there should have been better preparation for the release. Before it came out, there should have been a UX and UI reset. It feels like it was built from a template instead of from scratch. Hope there could be an update in the future! Unfortunately, I will not be paying $15/month unless I see speed improvements."
2020-09-27 14:43:59,Love it,5,ariheart1,True,"I love it.  Just add a skip intro and skip end credits to your series. Thx

Thanks for adding the skip intro for the series. 

The other issue I have is the volume.  For the movies and shows, it seems very low however the 30 sec ads play loud. The ads seem to be the right volume because when I go to other apps it’s just fine.  Thanks!!!"
2020-09-02 19:06:48,Good Streaming Service,2,Darth Vader Lord Of The Sith,False,"You’re probably thinking finally a Warner Bro’s.  Streaming service! I  use to like this app until they got rid of the Harry Potter movies!!!!!! What the heck dude!? Why would you make a streaming service only designed for WB especially Harry Potter! That’s the other thing, we finally get HARRY POTTER on a streaming service and they decide to get rid of it all !!! What’s next, FRIENDS ? The Brothers of Warner don’t get the bigger picture like Disney +. Lucky for me, I’m almost finished watching the show FRIENDS.
After watching The Wizard, I’m getting rid of it."
2020-08-22 14:59:56,The sound quality is unacceptable.,1,Javish,False,"Kudos to HBO for finally showing films in their correct aspect ratio after so many years. The sound is horrendous (TV 4K). For some reason during the previews that air as you start playing content, the sound is amazing. 

But the moment the actual show/movie starts it's awful. You have to turn it all the way up to hear dialogue but then the sound effects are way too loud. If you browse the HBOMAX subreddit, there are dozens of complaints about this and it seems to be a carry over from the HBO GO / HBO NOW versions.

Please provide this your immediate attention."
2020-08-19 13:12:42,Not enough content,1,RuneChainzz,False,"How can HBO charge so much for such  little of their content. They claim to have sub categories ready such as DC, looney Tunes,  Cartoon Network, [Adult Siwm] etc. but they don’t even have the majority of those prime television and movie content form those those studios. DC alone is missing a crap load of content. Not even to mention the looney tunes and Cartoon Network. All I’m saying how can HBO CHARGE SO MUCH for such little content. You literally have It’s competition charge half the amount for more than double the content. All I’m saying HBO you need more stuff or you will lose people’s interest fast."
2020-07-28 18:26:14,Best video streaming app I’ve used,5,Gooddayeveryone,False,Deepest library of big name movies over the entire history of hollywood. Imo. And no issues streaming unlike many other apps who are dropping connections all the time. Love the attention to classic titles as well as new films. I suggest the new viewers to try out the Clint Eastwood films. Can’t find such a deep collection of his films anywhere else. Thank you !
2020-07-12 05:25:51,"No Spanish,French, portugués etc language options",2,Charmander1410,False,"A wide range of movies and franchises that are well known. My major complaint is that you are not able to select the language you want to see it in. Only English, not very supportive and not to mention the bigger consumer viewer you could take in if you have a multi language option . Only way to see different language movies if they were originally made in that language. If that’s the case why not just leave the studio ghibli films in Japanese and not in English. 🤷🏽‍♂️"
2020-06-15 04:21:23,Confusing Interface,2,bmkruse,False,"First of all – HBO Max’s “Hubs” (which have the in-depth catalogs), should be prominently displayed at the top of the home page. Those shows and content aren’t even found until you scroll almost to the bottom of the page. Or accidentally come across it from the sidebar. 

I admire the way they’ve made their extensive catalog something of a strength. But it needs to be displayed first. 

As an HBO subscriber who accessed its library via HBO GO previously, this interface pales in comparison to that. The interface is lacking useful information similar to a website. Most of the data/ or links should be located above-the-fold. Such as shows that are “Featured”, “My List” & “Continue Watching”.  

Then as you scroll vertically down the page, things like “Coming Soon”, or “Just-Added” Movies/ Shows should follow the home page links."
2020-06-12 00:03:49,Umm.... Really?! They make it where you can’t,2,charibear,False,I glad I am using my free trail but it’s a waste since I can only watch on my phone or IPad. I have two Roku TV and can’t watch HBO Max on either. To watch on my Apple TV I have to AirPlay it.  It’s the most expensive streaming service out there and it only works on limit platform.  I can long into HBO now on Roku with the HBO Max long in info though but I really think most people signed up for HBO Max for friends. If your thinking about trying it out. I say wait until it’s more available on other providers.
2020-05-28 05:11:37,No keyboard and trackpad gestures support in 2020 :(,4,ninside,False,"There are a lot of things to like about the app. Prominent download buttons. Continue watching. Manage list.
Easy to discover content. 
I replaced prime video HBO access with direct HBO max. The biggest downgrade is keyboard support. Volume control with arrow up and down. Jump back/forward with arrows left and right. Space for pause. Swipe back on trackpad to go back. Etc. 
Please please please add support for keyboard and trackpad."
2020-06-13 06:53:36,Binge Worthy Feature Request,3,Kaytejarl,False,"I’ve been an HBO subscriber for a while and I’m glad to see the inventory expanded. However now that more shows are available (that people tend to binge) I would love to see a “Skip Intro” feature and or speedier cut after credits. I’ve been spoiled by using this style of feature on other platforms and would love to see it here. 
User Interface is important, with millions at home streaming/ binging give us a little treat with a Skip Intro button."
2020-08-28 04:06:43,Bad,1,evil 👽,False,"I like the shows. However, the app keeps signing me out of my account. It’s a terrible pain to sign back in it’s challenging, won’t take my password and when I try to change it HBO says they’ll email me a new password and never do. I just want to watch my show and end up spending over an hour trying to fix my account. I like and enjoy watching the the shows I think there’s a good selection but there’s no sense in paying for the subscription if I can’t sign in to watch the shows. Please just send me an email with how to get a new password already."
2020-09-28 08:56:46,Buffering & Screen mirroring problem,3,x.calii.x,False,"HBO Max has great shows/movies but it seems when I’m not streaming it from my iphone and try to play it on the big screen on my PS4, it buffers sooo much and won’t even play, it may be an internet problem but everything else loads super fast on my ps4 with my internet including Netflix,Hulu, etc... so instead I tried to screen mirror it from my iPhone and it literally won’t let me on the HBO Max app? It’s really disappointing. 🙁"
2020-06-05 04:17:03,Junk!!!!,1,ItsTaz,False,I signed up for HBO 2-4 weeks ago and was using HBO Go to stream shows from my phone to my old Apple TV. Didn’t have any issues. Several days ago I was force on to this new app and I can barely watch for 5 minutes before it stop playing. I downloaded a show since I got a repeated “internet connection” error message (which I didn’t believe) and I still have issues streaming from my phone to the Apple TV. Thanks a lot for forcing a crappy new app on me and preventing me from watching what I’m paying for. How do I get refunded for all this wasted time and frustration?!?!?!?!
2020-05-30 02:33:54,Are you kidding me!!!,1,Rita Sul,False,"I never ever leave reviews. I also never ever get mad or upset. I usually just let things go. But, thisssssss....I am beyond upset with how this all turned out. You spent so much money advertising something that was supposed to be SO amazing and it is absolutely horrible. YOU HAD ENOUGH TIME TO FIGURE THIS OUT!!! I am unable to download the app on my IPad. Can only watch my one show on my phone and there isn’t a stopping point on it...so If I fall asleep, it just keeps going and going. Find a way for us to be able to have this app on ALL PLATFORMS. Quit cheating people out of their money. Man UP!!!"
2020-05-29 02:09:06,Really??,1,jazzy0803,False,So now I can’t freaking watch any of the shows I USED to watch on the HBO Now app because I didn’t know updating the app would cut my access?? I shouldn’t have to go to the website to watch shows! Why didn’t you just create a new app? What’s the point of this HBO Max B.S. if people can’t access the shows they used to?? You all are money hungry donkeys (you know the word I really want to say). Shame on you for cutting people’s access and not giving them a heads up that updating the app would result in no longer being able to access the things they could on the HBO now app!
2020-09-26 18:21:18,"Content is good, but AirPlay works about half the time",1,floridaman2000,False,"Good luck trying to airplay anything to your tv with this app. I’ve attempted countless times to air play shows and movies to my tv and it simply doesn’t work. Or when it does work it cuts out after 5 minutes of use and you have to mess around with it for 10 minutes to get it to stream on your tv. 

Also what a terrible design for an app to default to only working over WiFi on your phone or tablet, even when you have unlimited data and they advertise you can stream anywhere with it."
2020-07-26 02:06:47,Needs improvement,3,Mdeeeeem,False,Hbo should have the language option as a drop down menu of some sort instead it is a weird one button which goes between the languages whenever you click on it. If you start the movie in one language and want to watch it in a different language it stays in true original language you chose rather than the one you want- very annoying. Please fix that.
2020-09-08 22:34:58,The worst streaming app!,1,Ncs131313,False,"Simply horrible. Can't watch a movie on iPhone X without a million problems. Gets stuck, disconnects, suddenly shows black screen but movie goes on. And restarting the app rarely fixes the problem. Have to delete and re-upload the app almost every time we watch a show! 

Shocking that HBO spends 100ds of millions on creating great programs but they try to save on the most important thing there is: the tool that brings these movies to the customer. Whatever pleasure the series bring into our lives is destroyed by this stupid dysfunctional app. FIX IT ASAP!"
2020-07-26 14:57:07,No Good Movies and Expensive. Also stole my money.,2,pump did 9 damage,False,I’m editing this review and saying that the service stole my money. I paid $16 for a month of this service and only got 2 weeks and now wants me to repay. I don’t even think it’s worth it because most of the movies I’m seeing are really boring or I’ve already seen. I only bought this expensive service because of Close Enough. However that’s the only thing I watched because I can’t find any other good movie or show. Does this service even have like newer titles.
2020-07-16 21:45:40,It’s off to a good start.,5,AgentWoomy,False,Many people complain about HBO Max for it’s lack of support on other devices. It’s still quite new so you can’t blame the developers for it’s lack of support plus the app itself is pretty clean and easy to use I personally haven’t had any problems experience-wise. It’s a great app that just needs minor improvements.
2020-07-06 02:10:48,Eh...,2,hsalonzo,False,"Eh. It’s very hard to navigate. Before the app change, I had HBO Now and it was super easy to find the shows that I wanted to watch. Now, it seems I have to spend 30 minutes looking for my show, which is annoying and makes me close the app and go somewhere else. 

It needs to be better organized. I get having the other networks...but I feel all the movies and shows are grouped into one section. I personally would like to see it organized by individual networks. 

It can be better."
2020-06-04 23:10:04,Doesn’t work with Apple TV HBO subscription,1,RA RED,True,"I am subscribed to HBO through Apple TV. Apple claims that HBO MAX is included with Apple TV HBO channel if you sign in with Apple ID but that’s a false claim. HBO Max charged me $15/m extra (7 days trial is free). I have no problem in spending some extra bucks but business model based on lies and deceit will not work

Looks like the response is just a poorly programmed generalized statement from a bot. I clearly said , I subscribed through Apple TV HBO channel which includes HBO MAX. I know how to sign in. Your HBO Max is messed up or you are just plain unethical who should be sued for making false claims and fraudulent charges."
2020-06-02 07:37:35,Love it,5,Tommy1179,False,"Only problem I’ve had so far is when I try to scroll down on the titles info I can’t so I can’t read all of what the show are movie is about hopefully u fix this issue 
Other than that live the app works way better than Disney plus when I got that. 
Was just going to do the free trial but will definitely keep."
2020-05-28 13:51:35,Amazing!,5,hellomommma,False,I love everything about this app it’s easy to navigate and it has all the shows that you can’t stream anywhere else. If you have a direct tv you get it free which is another huge plus. It has shows ranging from pretty little liars all the way to all 8 Harry Potter movies I would recommend you try it it’s definitely a game changer!
2020-09-24 04:34:57,Poorly designed user interface,2,robchronos,False,"Like many others, I’ve found the Apple TV app to be very poorly designed:

1. There’s only one way to search for titles: using the onscreen keyboard which is SO very painful. Every other streaming app has a search field that lets you use voice input or your iPhone keyboard if desired.

2. Movies don’t always disappear from the Continue Watching section when finished. You have to go to the HBO Max website to get rid of them.

3. You can’t see other episodes of a series from the Continue Watching section. If you want to see the episode list, you have to SEARCH for the series (did I mention how painful that is?)

Because of all of these problems, I try to avoid the HBO Max app and instead use Apple’s TV app for things like searching (which fortunately includes results from HBO)."
2020-08-14 12:22:26,Can’t connect consistently,2,7468385388257397488257,False,"I enjoy the app when it works.  However, whenever I change WiFi networks I receive an error message when I try to login.  The most recent has been true for several days.  I can login with my phone but not my tablet (and I could before).  I have restarted my tablet, logged out/in of my TV provider, and removed and replaced the app with no results.  It seems that you have a good product with a poor application when looking at other comments."
2020-08-09 00:26:00,WORST OF THE WORST.  Rarely does this even work,1,minecraftpleasestopcrashing,False,"I do not write reviews.  Usually ever.   BUT after having evening after evening ruined by trying to use this app, (so I could movie marathon with my daughter or trying to have a romantic evening). 
It doesn’t work on the phone, it doesn’t won’t to work on the smart tv and it will not even cast.   I can not believe they got my money for this, and the amount they charge to use this mockery.   I should have read more reviews before downloading so I wouldn’t get caught in this utter display of incompetence.  HBO should do everyone a service and refund their money and then pay them to use this poor excuse of a service.   

But hey!!!! At least they will let all of the previews of what they want to show you play just fine and then of course once the movie starts..... crap.   

Goodbye HBO.  Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice..... well that won’t happen."
2020-08-07 19:13:21,Disappointed,1,hs2554,False,"I’ve been trying all day to login to HBOMax from my iPhone with no prevail. Every time I try logging in it gives me an error message saying that too many attempts have been made trying to login. That could be the furthest from the truth. I’ve tried troubleshooting all suggestions from Google, but still no luck. I’m not interested in changing my password.  I not only have Internet and cable (HBO included with my ATT package), but also unlimited wireless service. Guess I’ll have to miss out on a program that I was truly excited to watch. Thanks a lot HBOMax app or ATT."
2020-06-13 00:22:06,I will eat crow,5,Homebrew81,False,I complained earlier that I had downloaded content but it streamed is anyway. It gobbled up data. I put my phone on airplane mode and found a different way into downloaded content from there. I was mad at first. The developer pointed out that I was probably in the wrong section. They were correct. For that I am reevaluating them at 5*.
2020-06-03 05:30:58,So many problems and glitches,2,disney098,False,"I know this app is new but it needs lots of work! Great options of shows/movies to watch but the app is constantly giving me problems on the tv and on my phone. The app just suddenly shuts down, it forgets what episode I left a series on, it’ll tell me there’s an error and just freeze, I’ll press one thing and a whole other movie will come up. But hopefully with upcoming updates everything will get better. I’m so happy to be able to watch friends again"
2020-10-18 06:37:36,Horrible for trying to cast to TV,1,Jparkgirly,False,"So, there’s no fire stick app so I have to cast through Apple TV or chromecast. Ugh to both. No other tv app is so glitchy. Apple TV—will play and then at random intervals just pause the show. Chromecast—after you connect and press play the controls to chromecast disappear so if you want to pause you have to close out of the app, then to keep playing you have reconnect and then press play again. Newest IOS and most up to date HBO max app. And I deleted it, restarted my phone, reinstalled it and restarted my phone again. Same issues."
2020-06-13 04:36:41,Close to great,3,geepolkgee,False,"The app is good, but really, really wish it didn’t require bouncing out of the Apple TV app to watch content—it would be fantastic if content just streamed within the Apple TV app (like it does with Channels, including CBS All Access for example and even the previous HBO offering through Apple TV Channels). 

I understand that’s beyond the scope of just this app, but this is a component of it, and the overall user experience suffers because of it.

Please, please consider this."
2020-07-19 00:36:59,Not Voiceover friendly!,1,Boandkatie,False,It’s not Voiceover friendly using my iPhone 11 Pro.  I did not try it on any other device.  Almost everything I do is on my iPhone 11 Pro using Voiceover.  Voiceover is very clunky on HBO Max app.  I can’t advance to the next item by using Voiceover jesters by swiping.  If I want to search around the screen I have to move my finger around the screen.  I am probably missing a lot of content by doing things this way.  It would be helpful if I and other Voiceover users could simply swipe around the entire HBO Max app smoothly to fully engage in the experience.
2020-07-03 00:32:40,Problematic,2,MrPBS,False,"This app has possibilities. I like the addition of TCM and Ghibli content. However I noticed that when I’m online and try to play a download it streams the title instead of playing the download which costs me a lot of data. The solution, so far, is to go offline and then the app directs me to the download page. I guess it’s a glitch in the app’s program which should be fixed. Secondly, when a download expires and I attempt to “renew” it doesn’t renew the download. I will update my review when problems are corrected."
2020-06-09 04:52:54,Good Content. Buggy App.,2,ZenMartha,False,"I’m enjoying the selection of entertainment here but theApp needs work. When I stream a movie from either my phone app or my iPad app, I get an error message that it can’t play the movie or show. If I respond to that message it crashes. If I ignore the message it plays the movie to the end. Unlike other Apps that stream media you can move to another app without it shutting off the movie and you can dim the iPad or iPhone. I am running the latest version of IOS on an iPhone 11 and an iPad Pro."
2020-05-31 01:00:17,Does not prioritize downloads and forgets place,1,Pandas at the Zoo,False,"I download episodes because my internet is intermittent. The only way to use the downloaded episodes is to turn wifi off, but often I need to leave it connected (for example, downloading software update). Even though I have the episodes downloaded, it shows that the episode is buffering because my current connection is not good enough.
Also, it does not save the place I left off at for downloaded episodes. When I start an episode I have partially watched, it starts at the beginning."
2020-10-17 05:45:09,"Great content, terrible interface",3,TasaPNW,False,"I’m so fed up with this clunky app I’m actually thinking of canceling my subscription! No ability to turn off auto play, getting back to episodes in series and wanting to restart episode (it can be done but only after wasting time hunting through the app for the main listing of all the episodes in a series)...I get tired just trying to explain it. HBO, there’s just no excuse for so bad an app. Fix it!"
2020-05-27 22:12:52,HBO Max was worth the wait,5,njhchung,False,"I’m glad I waited for HBO Max. Heard about it late last year, and waited so long for this. Holy crap, this update is GOOD. 

The app is so sleek, hasn’t crashed on me and is just all around easy to use (take note Netflix, your UI has gotten progressively worse over the years). 

It also comes with all 8 Harry Potter movies. You really can’t ask for more!"
2020-05-27 21:32:07,Criminals,1,Jfary,False,"Total disaster so far and can’t get a person on the phone who knows how to help me. Oh and here’s a nice little slap in the face: just - week ago the “hbo now” app disappeared from my Apple TV. So I try watching hbo now on my i pad and I figure I’ll mirror it to my tv. Nope. They somehow rigged it so I cant mirror it. So I spend hours on the phone with Verizon who tells me I don’t pay for hbo any longer. But I produce an Apple bill which says I do. The other thing that is hasn’t been accessible to me in over a week is hbo go which I’ve been watching on Apple TV, phone and iPad for about 3 years. Morons"
2020-10-01 21:44:20,"Shows are great, app is garbage.",1,lpr2012,False,"There’s no reason this app shouldn’t support 4K. HBO has taken shows that I’ve watched before on the same set-up and made them complete garbage.

The Apple TV app should get negative stars. I’m forced into this half-baked, garbage app so AT&T can steal more of my data and habits than they can get through other players that work well? Please. The piece of garbage TV app doesn’t even support scrubbing, so god forbid you need to go to the middle of a movie, which you often do since the app will often crash and not remember where you were in the film."
2020-08-25 14:19:02,If 0 starts we’re an option,1,Gingerlandmommy,False,"That’s what I’d give. One day, out of NOWHERE, the app stops working. I have an account t that I pay for and can use on my TV with a fire stick, but it WILL NOT WORK on any laptop, tablet, or other mobile devices.  It tells me that my service is not supported. It used to work fine, now it’s a waste.  We will be canceling our account because this is has been an issue for MONTHS and has yet to be resolved.  I’ve tried to contact HBO about this issue multiple times, and NOTHING is done to fix it.  This is how you lose business."
2020-08-04 01:49:05,Got HBO through AT&T?  Think again.,1,DragonEddie,False,"Ever since the HBO Max campaign rolled out, anyone who had access through the AT&T unlimited data plan has been cut off.  I've called in repeatedly and they can't/won't help me.  Last time I called in they bounced me back and forth between customer support & tech support and each claimed that the issue is with the other department.  This went on for 4 HOURS.  Each transfer the sound quality got gradually worse and worse.  Last guy I talked to was really nice and confirmed that this has been pretty prevalent.  Then he promised to move this up the chain and confirm via e-mail.  

That was over a month ago.  

Never got an e-mail.

I tried the chat function but as I was waiting for anyone to answer, it kicked me off because it claimed that I wasn't responding so I got booted.  

Don't even bother with this app and don't expect any help."
2020-05-28 01:31:08,I am still paying — why can I not access through an App now?,1,JWK2408,False,"I understand the contractual issues with Roku, through whom I subscribed years ago.  But why am I cut off from all HBO Now access through an app until that gets resolved?  I cannot log into Max, even into the limited library I still have a right to watch.  I am stuck with a cludgy browser interface, unless I am missing some obvious solution.  And there doesn’t seem to be an option to go back to the old now interface.  Very frustrating to a long time customer."
2020-10-06 22:41:58,Casting feature worked fine then didn’t,3,AEC76,False,I have a Vizio smart cast tv. I have no stream/cast issues with my other apps. Hbo Max was working fine until two weeks ago. It will not cast from my iPhone or iPad to the tv any longer. I have searched the Internet high and low for a fix but it seems there are none. I am not purchasing a chrome cast to attach to my tv since it’s already built in. What is the issue HBO max?
2020-07-11 19:19:07,“My list” needs improvement,3,Angvaz,False,"There should be a specific section where I can assess My list and not have to scrolled to the side to see everything I have added and on top of that I can’t see everything I have added to it, there is some limit. My boyfriend spent hours adding stuff to our Smart Tv app to later realize only part of it is in that list. Please fix that. Other than that, no complaints."
2020-10-04 05:17:07,HBO max was a complete mess and is a scam,1,matias11133,False,"when I tried to cancel my subscription they didn’t give me the option on my phone they just said to renew subscription clearly they are to still have me have that subscription they can go to hell I got 15 dollars off my credit card and before I also tried to cancel my subscription but it gave me no option on my phone I refuse to download this ever again money I could of used to buy food but no and let me remind I have no computer so I had no option but to continue it , very bad !!!"
2020-09-06 19:27:41,Great content but app needs fixing badly!!,1,Mustang2066,False,The user interface is lousy and the downloading feature is broken. The downloads section is buried in the user profile and more than half the time that I try to download something the download percentage just gets stuck at 0% and once it does get downloaded after I watch it and try to delete the download it takes forevvvvver until it even registers that I tapped on the buttons to edit and delete it. I love the content but the app itself is crap! Very frustrating to use!
2020-07-15 03:35:52,APP REPEATEDLY CRASHES TO SIGN-IN SCREEN,1,543Ellie,False,"I wish I can give this app no stars, but unfortunately I am forced to put a star to complete my review. This app is really buggy to say the least: after logging in and getting to my “who’s watching screen” I hit my name and I’m automatically taken back to my log-in provider screen. This is very frustrating and annoying. The developers need to do a better job in fixing the bugs if they ever want this app to be successful. This is only my second time using this app and it’s very disappointing. Please fix the constant crashing!!!"
2020-07-06 05:48:04,Worst interface,2,James8497,False,"Pretty much the worst interface out of any other streaming service. 

Suggestions: center play/pause button, add next button for tv shows to play the next episode, show season number in the title that’s being played, make episodes easily accessible, add skip title sequence option, and fix the issue of closing out of minimized screen when episode ends and play next episode instead.

It’s really weird that the app is so terrible....
Come on, it’s 2020, streaming services are part of everyday life, I’m sure there is plenty of research about user experience of such apps, app development is pretty advanced. Being a multi billion dollars company, how did you end up rolling out such crappy app....you really dropped the ball. It’s been over a month now and no significant updates to fix this crap."
2020-06-16 23:22:44,HBO NOW subscribers have been SCREWED by HBO MAX,1,2for2tru,False,"I recently tried to use the HBO Now app on my iPhone, only to find it had been replaced by HBO Max. The app said I could use my NOW account info to log into MAX, but when I tried logging in it told me that because I subscribed through Roku, my account would no longer work. So now I’m paying for an NOW account that won’t work on either my iPhone OR Roku. How is that for screwing your customers??

My advice? Don’t spend money on an HBO account. There are so many PPV choices now, so why spend money on one that you cannot rely on to work with your devices?"
2020-06-16 00:28:41,Major connection issues,2,Shauntazzy,False,"I have had major connection issues on my PS4 since the update, it loads the previews just fine but it will not play any shows. Customer service says it’s my internet, but all my other streaming apps work just fine, as well as using my phone to stream the app with my internet. The issue has to do with the app and the PS4 specifically, I’m wondering if others are having the same issues. If I can’t watch on my tv anything I will have to unsubscribe."
2020-06-11 05:14:21,What am I paying HBO GO for??,1,bananna1237,False,"I haven’t use the HBONOW app on mobile in a while; we usually stream via Roku. I just saw that my app auto updated to HBOMAX instead of HBONOW and the Max app won’t let me log in with my EXISTING subscription that I pay for. Some kind of message about my subscription not being compatible, and telling me to watch through HBONOW online instead. When I go to the HBO Now website, there’s literally no place to sign in, just to download the HBO Now app, which no longer exists. Seriously ridiculous - why am I paying for a subscription I can’t access on all devices?"
2020-05-28 19:30:36,Love the App but,4,JeyMusicLover,False,"I would have stay with my subscription but then I realized that you can’t play in any of my tv. I have Roku in all my tv. I even try to see if I go to my Apple TV app it would work, but no. Could only use the app in my phone or my Mac on browser. So when HBO max is on other platform I won’t be using it. I can’t be watching on my phone all the time, I would have love to see it on my tv."
2020-08-01 18:29:56,"I love it, but there could be some improvements",4,shorty squad member,False,"I mainly was excited to get this because of access to ghibli content. I want to be able to watch it in Japanese without English subtitles, or even better, with Japanese ones. I can’t remove the subtitles while watching it in Japanese, but I think it would be a quick fix to have an option to remove the captions"
2020-06-29 04:06:45,"Review for the App, not the content.",1,Big ,False,"I switched to HBO Now years ago because I liked the idea of getting my content directly from the network that sources instead of paying Comcast. 

The only reason I did this was because HBO Now streamed their shows the second they aired locally on TV. I was able to watch every episode of Game of Thrones the moment they aired, no delay. If I got home a few minutes late I could start right at the beginning, making it veritably better than HBO Go or HBO w/ Comcast. 

For some reason, this FORCED upgrade to HBO Max has me sitting around waiting for my show to finish airing before I can play it for myself. Completely unacceptable and the only reason I ever made the switch to HBO Now. 

Game of Thrones is over, and while HBO still has the best content, I won’t stick with a service that sheds its biggest selling point for me. The competition is fierce."
2020-08-06 05:45:54,Headphone Quality Issues,4,C-Smoothie,False,My big complaint is that the sound can only be heard in my left headphone on random shows/movies. That just started this week. I didn’t have any problems with that while watching Curb Your Enthusiasm a month ago but it’s present now. I don’t have that issue with any other streaming sites. It’s even disproportionate without headphones.
2020-06-06 23:53:39,More subtitle/audio options !,3,Gabylicious18,False,"If HBO max wants to compete with Netflix it must offer a wide variety of Subtitles and Audio, at least start off with spanish for now. My parents pay the bills including subscriptions and for now they will only stick to Netflix because it's the only platform that will offer these variety selections. If you want more viewers streaming your service you must offer this! You are loosing viewers by not doing so!"
2020-05-31 16:51:30,Skip intro function,4,CutlerCa559,False,I find this app okay. Would have gave it 5 stars if they would have just added a SKIP INTRO while starting a new episode. Like for example I’m watching The Sopranos on my Samsung TV and the start of every episode there’s no SKIP INTRO which I find it annoying cause I have to manually fast forward every single start of an episode. Other than that it’s a great app.
2020-08-15 00:24:27,Interface is terrible,1,JDSomething,False,"Whether it’s on the iPad or Windows, HBOMax is terrible to navigate. But the biggest issue for me is downloaded programming. First, if you are connected to a data source it will stream instead of playing the downloaded material. Secondly, if you have no data (think flying) the competed downloads are so poor it attempts to “buffer” missing sections of the download. Making offline viewing very painful. So much for my Perry Mason binge while flying over the Pacific. Every episode had 15 seconds missing about every 3 minutes."
2020-09-20 21:53:09,Persistent audio issues,3,splme2,False,"I love the app, I love the content. All of it has been pretty good for me except the low audio levels on some content. The most egregious example was Deep Blue Sea where it was unwatchable due to dialogue not being decipherable. Today it was trying to watch The Invisible Man on the app (on a 4K Apple TV). It was in range but too low so I switched to watching the film off the cable box instead of the app. Please fix this. Thanks in advance"
2020-06-06 00:07:18,Eh. I expected better.,2,SEF89,False,"The two stars are for the content. Warner Bro’s obviously has some great programming available. 

If it wasn’t for the content it would be a one star review for the app itself. Lack luster features when compared to other streaming apps. Definitely have some improving to do for the plan price.  

There isn’t the ability to auto skip the intros to TV shows. You have to fast forward through it. 

The navigation of the episode list is frustrating and counter intuitive in my opinion. 

For the price I’m paying for this subscription I am not happy with the fact that there are ads at the begging of some programs - you can fast forward through them - but still. 

Biggest problem right now - I can’t get it on my ROKU!  Come to a freaking agreement already!!!!!"
2020-07-07 03:11:33,Meh,3,twingreatwaves,False,"The app itself is okay I suppose. It seems to work fine most of the time. My only issue is HBO removed their Apple TV channel so now I have to download another app when it was already built into my TV app with my other subscriptions. I would much rather watch it through the TV app because it is far superior in design and function. On the content side, I am fairly happy. Original HBO shows with some really Max originals."
2020-08-07 00:28:38,Garbage Downloading System,1,Tom smithgwgshs,False,"App is fine (minus occasional freezes and lag) but the system of downloading is such utter garbage. After tropical storm Isaias, I went into downtown to download shows. With 5 bars of LTE it took two hours to get to 51% on four TV episodes, I closed the app and when I came back everything, both partially downloaded and in the queue was gone. 2 hours wasted. Its now 8:30 PM and I am left without anything saved. It’s 2020, the issue of TV downloading shouldn’t be this awful. every other streaming service does this fine."
2020-07-06 19:23:35,Hit or miss after downloaded episodes,3,cjohnd10,False,This app has been hit or miss after downloading several episodes and then trying to watch them in airplane mode during travel.  All of the episodes say they are downloaded and have not expired but will not play... even after landing and on WiFi.  Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn’t...so much for watching them on the airplane....
2020-05-28 06:26:38,Been waiting for something like this!,5,Miss D. LeShe,False,"So happy that I can finally stream all of the Fresh Prince  episodes and a few of my other faves like Pretty Little Liars and Friends. It was simple to sign in with my tv subscription. 

I hope that add more shows like Wayans Bros, My Wife and Kids, Family Matters, A Different World, and 2 and a half Men.... and more 90s and 00s sitcoms."
2020-10-01 00:27:38,Fantastic,5,Xesrever333,False,"Watched an Entire Season of a Cool show, no problems at all. Added several shows & movies to my list and no problems with that either. Watched a downloaded Show offline and works fantastic. Highly recommend my family and friends to try this App out!! Love it!!"
2020-09-10 18:07:49,Unfortunate.,1,DasNeko08,False,I couldn’t cancel my subscription through an online platform. In able to cancel my subscription I had to download the app and do it through there because going online and trying to sign in would redirect me straight to the App Store. Definitely an unnecessary and annoying step. Then I log onto there only to be redirected back to the webpage I was originally trying to access to cancel my subscription. Which doesn’t really make any sense to me and honestly was very inconvenient and annoying.
2020-06-27 23:43:42,Not VoiceOver compatible,2,mirnitica,False,"I was really excited to get this app, though I am totally blind, I am an avid TV watcher; and really wanted to re-watch pretty little liars. Signing up for the free trial was easy because I did it from the website, but when I go to put in my credentials in the app, that button that says already sub subscribed  no matter what I do that button is not detected by my screen reader and normal of double tapping makes the button work. It’s really sad since  HBO is backed by such a huge company."
2020-10-19 00:39:17,What We NEED!!!,5,hangryhank,False,Its 2020 they’re should be a remove from list button! for all the half watched and unfinished  movies you’re not going to continue! I’d love to be able to jump back into my show without having to scroll through 10 different ones I didn’t like.
2020-09-04 17:22:31,The worst HBO app,2,Kmcquinn8956,False,"I have never had an app freeze as much as HBO Max. It is the only app that freezes, so I know it’s not our internet service. It freezes when I try to go to the next episode in a series, it freezes during viewing and the A/V gets held up and “skips”. It is incredibly frustrating but it is the service that came with AT&T unlimited. If I was paying for the service independently, I would cancel immediately. I only gave it two stars because I like HBO itself."
2020-08-18 20:23:24,No internet connection,1,never affais of Angie Stone,False,"I’m using an iPhone X with 13.6.1.   I successfully used the app on several occasions.  Recently when I click on the app, it opens to the message that I have no internet connection.  I checked a few other streaming apps on my phone and without hesitation they open and stream content without issues.  I vetoed I have internet connection and deleted and reinstalled the app twice.  That’s a lot just to get HBO MAX to work.  In the end know many default solutions as a techie junkie... the app just doesn’t work."
2020-07-15 22:36:27,Great app,5,kitttykat👑,False,This app is great good variety of movies! The thing i don't like is that i can only watch enjoy this on my iPhone? We have a Roku and been trying to find this app and it's not available? Why can’t it be available for us to enjoy this great movies on TV? And will it be available  soon for us to download it? 🙁
2020-07-10 03:36:22,This is horrible,1,rizintyde,False,"I can’t even log on. I’ve tried using my old hbo now password and log in, Nope. AT&T log in, nope. Resetting my password, nothing has been sent to my email yet so I guess that doesn’t work either. It even asked to verify my account by going to aT&T, when I click the link it provides it just refreshes back to the same page. The transition should never be this difficult and frustrating. I’m giving up tonight, maybe there’ll be an email to reset my password when I wake up in the morning."
2020-07-10 01:20:51,Missed timing of a show,4,Darren Sengphachanh,False,"I really like the streaming service and all but
For some reason I try watching a show I’ve been waiting to come out for 2 whole years (close enough) and it was an awesome experience.  Tho I have a problem with a sound error where the voices don’t match the frame of the video.  But that’s okay.  I’ll try another time"
2020-07-07 00:38:03,Bad initial user experience,1,sonivore,False,"It doesn’t matter how good your content is if it is a huge hassle to just start watching a show. Take my money! If you’re worried about Apple taking a cut, just charge me more! The sign-up process involves disclosing my name, email address, and agreeing to terms of service, when ideally it could be a single subscribe button. In a world where everyone has 1 million accounts and passwords, it would be nice if all of my content subscriptions could be managed through a single source that actually respects privacy."
2020-07-01 13:16:49,Good content But no Roku,2,jaymat33,True,"The content provided is good, and the way things are categorized helps. But the lack of availability on Roku is probably going to really impact subscription numbers. I find myself using other services that I can watch on my TV, rather than using my phone or tablet to use HBO Max. I’m going to give them a little while to figure it out, but they really need to make it more readily available if they’re going to want it to work. 

Also, doesn’t work off WiFi."
2020-06-19 21:46:26,HBO is bugging out,3,OfficailNia,False,"Every time I would try to watch something on HBO it would say “ video can’t be played right now , please try again later “ so I would either come back later , restart my phone , or close the application but every time it says the same thing .. I’ve been waiting for HBO max to air then I had to wait to get the app and now it’s bugging out .. please fix this problem ( I have an iPhone XR by the way )"
2020-06-30 15:20:14,Unable to watch on Roku,2,Kimbergro,False,"I was excited when the app on my iPad changed to Max. But then I couldn’t access it on my Roku devices...and now can’t access with my 3rd gen Apple TV device! I’m done...I’ve waited for you to come to an agreement with Roku, but Apple TV is the final straw. I can only watch on my iPad. Unless I am traveling, it is worthless to me. I have now unsubscribed for HBO. Someday, maybe, I will check again to see if you are on Roku. There are a lot of options besides HBO! Guess they will get my money now."
2020-10-01 06:41:09,Glitches,3,K coops,False,"-Sometimes when I open it, it freezes. 
-Everytime I try to play a show with airplay, I have to skip to the middle of the show just to get it to sync properly with the tv. It otherwise won’t do airplay. 
-if I want to fast forward, rewind or use close captioning, I have to do it by phone but the controls disappear unless I pause it on the tv. 
-sometimes if I rewind it, it glitches and skips and moves to a place I didn’t put it at or restarts.
-we have a smart TV and can stream all other apps through our tv except this one. We have to use our phones for this. So it really is drag when it doesn’t work well.

I hope the UX and programming is improved. So far we’ve been frustrated."
2020-06-19 07:28:28,Cant get signed in with mobile provider,1,Jules Faith,False,"I have AT&T as my mobile phone provider.  AT&T customers are suppose to get HBO MAX free with their unlimited plan. I have checked with my mobile provider, and yes, my phone plan does include HBO MAX. But, every time I try to sign in with my mobile provider, the screen keeps cycling back to the sign in page where it asks you to link your account. I have tried to sign in on my phone, my daughter’s phones, my son’s, my husband’s and even on a TV with no luck. I have even called tech support. Still, no luck!!!!!!!🤬😡"
2020-06-11 19:27:36,Just doesn’t work,2,amxndak,False,"I was very excited to finally watch hbo again; however, it’s very hard to watch anything on the app. I rewinded on a movie and for the rest of the movie, the frame rate dropped completely. The dialouge was so far in front of what was actually on the screen. I tried fixing my internet, I tried restarting the app and nothing worked. I’m very disappointed with this app and I hope there will be modifications to improve its’ quality of streaming."
2020-05-27 10:25:52,"For a new release, color me impressed",4,Ivan Zhivaga,False,"The lead up to this launch was a long one. Licensing deals, HBO executives leaving, and the question of how such a varied amount of content would be organized in app. But I have to say, it’s well laid out and the separation between different sections is nicely obvious. All in all, an excellent launch with great content for the same price as HBO Now. Looking forward to the Snyder cut!"
2020-09-18 16:34:29,Using Xbox? Read,3,Chris27CSS,False,If you are using this for your Xbox which is why I got the app forget it. Sometimes it will work long enough to watch a whole tv episode other times 5 minutes. After reading many other reviews I see it is a very common problem. I haven’t used it on my phone much yet but I will update if they fix the issue or if phone has similar results
2020-08-10 02:53:20,Don’t Download This App!,1,Jnbethany,False,"THE WORST streaming service I’ve ever used. HBO, you guys need to really get it together. I have HBO, but wasn’t necessarily interested in downloading HBO Max. But now there isn’t even an option to just have an HBO app on my phone. Not only was I forced to download the HBO Max app, but had to subscribe to it in order to watch some of my favorite shows on my phone or iPad. On top of that! You can’t even watch any shows from this app unless you are on the WIFI! I repeat, this is a horrible app and HBO has lost another customer. Do not download this app."
2020-06-28 05:08:44,HBOMAX in my TV not working,1,Jcantor13,False,"What is going on? I installed the app in my smart tv and I watched maybe three movies but each time it would take long to get connection to search for movies, since yesterday I have not been able to get movies the app is searching and searching, the three dots are blinking like it searching but it has not been able to load any movies anymore. It’s very frustrating. It’s supposed to be included in my package with my wireless but the app is not working in my TV like it supposed to . Not happy right now."
2020-06-09 16:33:02,Frustrating,1,Spider guy on the 4S 2012,False,When I pause and try use another app (reply to a message) and come back I have to start the show over again from the home screen and scroll back to where I left off. Sometimes I’ll come back and it starts where I left off. If I’m downloading to watch when I don’t have service if my phones screen goes dark I have to start downloading again from 0 and start over again from the homescreen. I would think I could download in the background while using other apps.
2020-06-06 20:02:07,Very Poor Decision,1,Frankie Stephenson,False,"I have had HBO Now for years and have been very happy. Today I tried to watch it on my phone and found out that HBO Now is no longer available and if I want to watch something I have to subscribe to HBO MAX. And if I subscribe to HBO MAX I can not watch HBO on my ROKU. So basically I have been forced to make a decision keep HBO Now and only watch it on my TV or subscribe to HBO MAX and only watch on my phone. My choice will probably be to drop HBO all together, as I'm sure a lot of other people will do. Thanks for making my choice to save money each month easier."
2020-06-03 14:44:25,So far so good,2,jeorgestow,False,"The app is good so far, but need some tweaking, needs a search by genre, and please give anime an independent genre, anime is not for kids.
A little big detail it doesn’t support Roku nor Firestick.

No other languages options, no suggestions, little content. I have had HBO for over 10 years so I was excited with this new app version, but I see no improvements in general to HBO now or HBO go.

A week later since the launch, the repertory is so little compared to the other streaming companies, still the language and subtitles option is basic, the biggest is the Roku and Firestick platforms not available yet! HBOMAX was announced one year ago, yet they couldn’t copy and paste, tweaked from the the other streaming apps... very disappointed now.. there was no need to create HBOMAX"
2020-05-27 12:35:05,Awesome!,5,PCx12123,False,"It has such a wide range of content with so many great films and shows, it’s almost overwhelming as I don’t know where to start first! It has a great system which makes it super easy to find what you’re looking for and I 100% recommend this to be added to your list of top streaming services."
2020-07-10 04:01:10,Won’t even open up,2,Grhdbfgu,False,"It has all the potential of being my next favorite streaming service but for some reason, when I leave the app and go back in later there’s some sort of connection error. At first I thought it was just my connection but all my apps work perfectly fine, I’ve tried re-downloading only for it to work for a bit before acting up again after I close out the app and go back in later on."
2020-06-08 03:23:32,Are you KIDDING me,1,love the live album,False,"I have paid for hbo now as long as I’ve been a cord cutter and was so excited to to see that my account rolled into hbo Max with all of the new content. Come to find out that the hbo Max app  is NOT ROKU COMPATIBLE!? So because I have a Roku tv I now have to go out and buy a new Apple TV or device (or whole new TV!?) to get the new hbo content I’m literally already paying for? Meanwhile my hbo now app still works, it just has none of the new stuff. Imagine a whole channel just being like “nope sorry f your brand of TV specifically”.  What a freaking joke."
2020-10-19 20:29:09,Issues!!,1,Camilla!2,False,It was a great app at first I really loved all the content. But then out of no where it logged me off ok no problem I tried logging back it and it said my information is wrong when I haven’t changed the password or anything it won’t let me connect using my xfinity information then it says I have to pay for the app but it’s suppose to come with my plan with Comcast. If this is just a way to get people to pay more for something they don’t have to pay for then I’m done HBO and Comcast
2020-08-18 05:28:39,"Great selection, bad App",2,No so patient man,False,"The movies and shows speak for themselves they’re top notch. But the app is really really bad. When I select a movie and hit play to chrome cast it will usually cause an error on my TV causing it to crash. When it does load it will play for no more than 20 seconds before it does the same, it will crash and cause my chrome cast to kick back to the menu. It’s a massive bug that means I can only watch these shows on my cell phone."
2020-05-29 18:01:56,Zero stars!,1,MoniMommy1,False,"They get zero stars but forced to give one in order to submit review. Why offer free subscriptions if you’re not going to honor them or pay for something you cannot sign in to?!?! It will not allow me to do either. Absolutely ridiculous! I sure hope you read your reviews and value your customers enough to compensate for all the inconvenience but most importantly, fix the issue and prevent this from happening to anyone else. I was never able to watch anything on the app & never reimbursed. Not happy."
2020-05-28 18:36:05,Hate the updated version!,1,Irritated human,False,"When I first received the notification that I would automatically be given this new updated version of this HBO Max, I figured it was cool. However, I did not think it would reset ALL of my saved content. Now I have to search for my shows; some of which I cannot remember, and save them again to my list. I am very unhappy with this. Also, some of the content HBO Now had advertised as coming soon that I was interested in watching is now completely gone so that makes me sad."
2020-06-26 23:58:08,Managing profiles not working,2,Nadedi,False,"I have just installed this on my phone and I created profiles for my kids with parental control and now it doesn’t let me see movies because it’s applying the parental restrictions to my profile as well. I have deleted and reinstalled the app, I have removed my kids profile and still the same. The section of Manage Profiles on the app doesn’t do anything but changing the circle around the name. You need to fix this ASAP."
2020-06-11 21:44:03,Paid subscriber yet still playing ads,3,Linachi,False,"I’m a new paid subscriber to watch Friends. I like that HBO offers good selection of movies and tv shows. However, between the shows, I just hate watching ads for other HBO shows they are promoting. I understand HBO wants to promote some of the shows and movies, however, it should only be played during the free trial periods not when you are already a paid subscriber."
2020-09-09 04:58:17,Great until it lost all my profiles,2,JeffTPharmD,False,"The app was working great, excellent content, no real gripes with the app itself. Then today I try to login and when it connects through my tv provider like normal all the user profiles for my family are gone, so is viewing history, etc... Deleting and adding app back didn’t fix the issue. This is a core function of this sort of app so 2 stars on what would easily be 4 or 5 if it functioned as expected."
2020-06-05 02:11:50,No audio,1,pjzzzzzz,False,Every time I try to play any movie or documentaries in my Tv there’s no sound at all. What am I supposed to do! And funny thing is It has audio on Phone or iPad. I did everything but nope no sound on my tv. It’s just for HBOMAX rest of the other apps  like Netflix and prime are just fine. You guys really need to fix this. And the app should be loading faster too it almost took me like whole 2 minutes every-time I try to login. These glitches might lose your subscribers as fast as they come in the first place.
2020-05-27 11:41:36,HBO Max is Solid 👍🏻,5,JackInfinity203,False,"I just started using HBO Max after I got it for free (thanks to HBO Now), and so far so good! I’m hoping more big titles like (The Matrix) arrive on here, because so far the content here is great!! The interface is pretty simple and easy to use, but I do expect some changes between now and then. For now, HBO Max is perfect for those who love HBO and Warner Bros."
2020-06-05 15:21:02,Great selection - major connectivity issues,2,Rev. Lord,False,"HBO has my favorite shoes and the movie selection here is nothing short of amazing. If I could ever connect. Or when I do, stay connected. And it’s not my WiFi. Other streaming services work perfectly. I tried using my data on my phone, same problem.  This would be the best streaming service available, if it worked. I spend more time watching those three dots than I do my favorite shows."
2020-08-23 20:07:13,Glitchy,1,AnthroGirllll,False,"Sometimes HBO Max works, but most times, there is no sound for ANY of the movies or series. It’s not my TV, because if that was the case the sound would never work. Also, if you try to use the back button after watching an episode or a movie to return to the home screen, it never loads! You’ll have to exit the app completely and go back in. I cancelled my membership because there’s no point in paying for a streaming service that doesn’t work most of the time."
2020-07-16 18:23:25,Crashes and logging out every single second,1,Tomthebrilliant,False,"So I decided to get a free trial of hbo max so I decided to watch some shows you know like close Enough and all that stuff 2 weeks later I ago onto hbo max and suddenly it says that I’m locked out! But I don’t even remember signing out. So I sign back in and I continue watching hbo max shows, BUT THEN while I’m in the middle of the show a second later it suddenly says “SIGNING OUT” when I was in the middle of a show! Please hbo max fix this stupid bug you have the worst streaming app ever"
2020-06-23 19:58:29,Great app but needs auto play,5,ImGoingToXPLODE,False,I love being able to watch all the shows and movies. It would be very beneficial to have an auto play feature and a skip intro option or skips intro automatically if auto play was used from last episode.
2020-06-14 09:13:33,Pretty good app,4,CrAzY_77,False,"I don’t know if it’s just me but, the sound seems kinda low compared to the other apps. I have to put the volume up pretty high just to hear the conversations people have either in the movie or tv shows.  I haven’t used to much of the app because I’ve been busy, but the sound was my only complaint so far."
2020-06-14 01:54:01,"Content is good, app stinks.",1,F-U AT&T,False,"The layout of the app stinks. My son wants to watch DC Comics stuff, and the adult profiles have a special tab to make it easy to find. My son is special needs and has difficulty typing out names and whatnot. It seems mighty stupid to give adult profiles more tabs to make things easier to find so why in the hell doesn’t a child’s profile have more ease of access buttons. Then again, coming from AT&T I should know better than to expect anything to be well thought out or easy to use."
2020-08-07 18:50:54,Start From Best Streaming Practices,2,LazFuentes,False,"We should not have to be your product managers. Start the user journey from the high point of what is already accepted as “best practice” in streaming. Also, you’ve had years of learning from GBO Go and Now that should’ve been baked into this app and it’s like you threw all that learning out. By the looks of this app, some of your WFH product people are doing more relaxing at home than working. Fire a few to wake the rest the fk up."
2020-10-18 22:57:02,Poor airplay support,1,Jcdentonkiran,False,"This app is terrible UX wise and playback wise. All the content is restricted to 1080p. On vizio the chromecast only plays audio in stereo. Airplay does play audio in dolby format but for some reason HBO restricts the video to 720p. Pathetic! The airplay pauses in between because HBO plays different videos! First the trailer plays and the airplay pauses, then you hit play manually again and there’s a video about “this is a hbo presentation” followed by the actual movie. What a terrible experience! The wishlist is hidden under the user icon for some reason."
2020-10-03 00:50:18,I am a subscriber but cannot login,1,RachelK2012,False,"I can’t use any of my subscribed benefits online because I can’t login. AT&T can’t seem to fix it - they are totally at a loss since I came in before bundled services and before they bought DirectTv (when Directv was separate things were a lot simpler) and therefore HBO can’t fix it; therefore, the app is completely useless for me. 0 stars if I could. A separate login would solve this issue - I provide my account # and set my email and password. Fixed! But no, that’s too easy."
2020-09-12 05:28:44,Closed captions need to be fixed,4,Mredlp,False,I really like the app I really don’t have any problems when I use it movies and shows load with out a problem. However the closed captions need to be fixed I press the cc option on the bottom corner to turn them on but nothing appears on screen.
2020-08-14 04:24:26,"Good in concept, bad in execution",1,Calmighty,False,"I like the app because it gives the option to download for offline viewing. It also has Close Enough (which I’ve waited years to watch)

That’s pretty much where all of the good ends. For some reason I can’t pull up my downloads unless I have service. Even then, if I’m watching something I have downloaded and I lose service again, the message saying I’ve lost connections comes up on the screen. 

I believe that some bug fixes, and this app will be golden"
2020-08-13 21:09:30,Can’t Log in,1,Sandruuhh,False,I downloaded HBO Max a couple of days ago and it let me sign in through my tv provider without any issue. The next day I went on the app and saw it logged me out so I proceeded to try to log in with my tv provider. Every time I press the log in button it gives me a “connection failed” message. Other people at my house can log in through the provider with no problem. I’ve deleted and re-downloaded the app a handful of times and it still does not work. I don’t know what to do.
2020-07-12 03:56:10,WHERE IS THE ROKU APP,2,mnunez20,False,"I won’t make this longer than it needs to be: the content is GREAT. Fantastic even. Loading is inexplicably slow, and like others have pointed out, it is not very user friendly in that it’s hard to find where you left off when binging a show. Again, bizarre at this point for a streaming app. But worst of all, I hate that I cannot watch this on my tv with my roku. HBO, please get contracts in order to make it happen. It’s been a month now!"
2020-06-06 09:23:35,There is no skip intro!,4,olivialiv10,False,"I would live this app even more if there was a skip intro button while the intro plays. This is because I find it very annoying that you have to skip past the intro manually. I would love if you added this feature. Otherwise, keep up the good work, and keep adding amazing features."
2020-05-31 19:21:33,DISAPPOINTED,1,nsb9720,False,"So, I see that HBONOW has been “replaced/upgraded” by this supposed new app...all WITHOUT clear instructions to user on how and WHERE it would be available prior to the “upgrade”.  I just attempted to log in only to learn that it’s “not available” on my devices and I can’t get to the old app via Prime Video - WHO PLANNED THIS MESS???????

Tell me how to watch the remaining HBO shows that I’ve paid for until I can get the new mess!!! And, oh btw, I have an HBO account that I can’t even use to upgrade to Max...for some reason it isn’t recognizing it.  Go figure.."
2020-06-05 00:42:08,It’s worth it.,5,Mr. Leon From California,False,"It’s worth the price because you get movies and shows from: Cinemax, HBO, DC, CNN, TNT, TBS, truTV, Cartoon Network, Adult Swim, Rooster Teeth, Looney Tunes, and Warner Bros all in one place. They have hundreds of movies and shows plus they’re adding more every week! It’s better than Netflix because Netflix doesn’t have that much newest movies like HBO MAX does..."
2020-05-27 17:46:46,Disappointing start,3,Cell.shell,False,"There are a lot of movies here, but it’s the little things that are off Putting.  Things like cropping friends to fit wide screen instead of keeping the original aspect ratio.  

If you are going to offer anime or other foreign films, please make sure to include the original audio as an option.
Not including Japanese language and subtitles to the studio Ghibli films is a huge miss as most watchers of Ghibli studios are older than young kids.

I opted to try for this reason alone and was greatly disappointed (like season 8 of GoT level of sad)

 You can also let the user decide on language, and whether to allow for full screen vs cropped.  

I’m hoping this gets fixed in future updates."
2020-09-04 23:51:37,No picture when connect Apple device to a TV,3,Hal9003,False,"I download content (high quality) while at the office to watch when at home where there is no reliable broadband internet connection. I connect my iPhone or iPad to the TV using the Apple cable.  Lately when I try to watch content, there is no picture on the TV. The device says “streaming to tv”, but I get sound only. 🥴"
2020-05-27 14:06:04,"Loving the design, features, and content!!",5,DelosDestinations,False,So much new content to explore in addition to the always incredible HBO original programming and licensed films! The interface is really nice and I can only imagine how great this app will be once they roll out even more of the features and content they’ve announced! Great stuff!
2020-10-11 01:33:07,Complete disaster,1,Jxvnniiyf,False,"I don’t know who the genius was who decided that there should be THREE different apps (HBO Now, HBO Go, HBO Max, etc.) but it is a nightmare trying to figure out which one is active at the moment and what content it has. I subscribed to HBO Now (or was it HBO Go? I can’t even remember at this point) and now they’ve come out with HBO Max, which, surprise, doesn’t work with ROKU. So I got a chromecast so I could watch the content that I am already paying for, and the app won’t even let me sign in. Complete and utter failure of an app and a company."
2020-09-21 23:55:48,I had left a not so positive review.,5,dizwasrichie,True,When I first got on hbo Max I didn’t like how it didn’t keep the movie if I left to answer a text. Hbo has for sure listen to my comment cause it is no longer an issue. I am sure I am not the only one they heard but it feels good to know they listen.
2020-09-09 15:04:27,Love the service...when it works,1,Peacedog7,False,I really like their service. The app needs work. I dislike that I download episodes to watch while offline and I can watch 2 then it asks me to sign in again. But I can’t because I’m not online. The whole point was to be able to watch when not online. Now I’m back with service and I just get a blank screen every time I log in. I deleted and re-downloaded but it’s the same thing. I go through this just about every day. Frustrating.
2020-07-16 18:27:49,Needs work!,3,betseyville0820,True,"There should be a feature where I can see all episodes, like being able to click on the title instead of having to search. 
Also, after there’s a glitch with what I’m watching, it doesn’t come back to whatever I was watching but it skips to the next episode and the previous episode disappears. 
Please be added to Roku."
2020-08-22 19:57:00,"Sometimes it works, sometimes not",2,NeededAUniqueNickname,False,"The app is very hit or miss on whether it decides to work. 

HBO shows are amazing, but the effort it takes to watch them on their app is terrible. The app fails to play any content either locally on the phone or via chromecast. Using WiFi or cellular data doesn’t seem to make a difference either. The app loads, you can browse shows, but nothing will play. This behavior happens to sporadically that it feels random."
2020-08-14 00:25:17,Download disappears,2,coford65@gmail,True,"What is the problem here?  I have to download movies when the traffic on our hotspot is slower, since ATT does not provide rural customers any option but a cellular hotspot. The problem is that when I download a movie to watch later, later the movie starts download all over again. This is insane why does it always do this. It is impossible to watch it as it streams since the cell service is so bad. Please fix this."
2020-08-09 01:35:37,Bring back “Legendary Nights”,5,HPMJuice,False,"The movies & vast variety of tv series are great. But I really enjoyed “Legendary Nights the tale of Gatti-Ward”. As a kid I was fascinated by the old “Legendary Nights” & other boxing documentary series, I really really hope you guys bring back the docs on the sport of Boxing would definitely bring back that fan base from the days of HBO & boxing."
2020-07-15 00:58:40,Buffering is ridiculous,2,c.latrice,False,I’ve had hbo now and switched to max. I still have the same issue with it buffering all the time. Can’t watch anything without it buffering. It’s not my internet connection because all other streaming services for fine. It’s just this app even when I use the computer it never fails. There are so many complaints I don’t really understand why we’re still having the SAME issue.
2020-06-13 05:34:09,I understand now why this app is so low rated,1,Ikerus,False,"Just downloaded the app, can’t sign in. Just get a message that says “can’t connect. We’re having issues connecting to HBO Max right now. Please try again.”

This appears to be on the developers end. My internet is fine, all other streaming apps that I have are working fine. Tried multiple times and getting the same message over and over.

Amazing that the app can’t even perform the first function of logging in. It looks like HBO doesn’t want me money. I’m sure all the other reviews that are criticize other major problems of this app are legit.

I’ll spend my money else where and probably never go with HBO again. Learned a long time ago that apps that launch like this rarely ever get fixed. Years later they have the exact same issues."
2020-05-31 14:40:15,"Disastrous rollout, fallout",1,fgoodenough,False,"We had planned for months to sign up only to find at the last moment that our streaming services *and* smart television “don’t qualify” for service. This, after watching quality programming on HBO literally for decades, seemed a genuine disappointment—until closer examination reveals much repetition and relatively little exclusive programming. Perhaps this particular conglomerate will make things right. I’m not holding my breath, and will stick with other services and different workarounds until ATT and/or WarnerMedia comes to its senses. 
Zero stars."
2020-05-27 22:46:06,Awesome!!,5,-ups-man,False,"People really need to read and follow instructions before they leave a negative review. I have the AT&T 1000 plan and this app is flawless. Easy. Fast. Even a caveman could do it. Forrest Gump’s mom was right... Stupid is as stupid does. If you have AT&T, don’t listen to what the stupid people write. 

Read. Listen. Apply. 

It works."
2020-05-27 18:22:58,Great App!,5,FireSamue,False,"Logged in with AT&T login without any issues. The app was easy to setup and looks sleek. Playback works instantaneously. Great job so far on having a nice app. 

For those giving low stars for app not being available on Roku, go find a forum or go to HBO’s site to complain. The iOS App Store is not the place for that."
2020-09-12 04:43:43,Don’t work half the time,1,Sippuden,False,"So I login to my HBO MAX account and then it tells me I don’t have a subscription. So I called my provider (Cox) and told them if they could help me. I was on the phone for 2 hours trying to get it working. Finally it starts working, just to find out about a week or two it’s saying to same thing over to me that I have to pay for HBO MAX when I’m already paying for it. This has happened to me a least 4-5 times. It’s like why am I paying for something I can’t use????"
2020-09-09 05:34:19,Great initially.,2,Per plot,False,The HBO Max app was a 5 star app until the last week.  I don’t have the ability to airplay over WiFi. Up until a week ago I could download a movie or show and cast to my tv using the hdmi to lightning adapter flawlessly.  Now whenever I try to I get audio on the TV with no picture and a black screen.  Other streaming services still work using the above mirroring technique.  It’s hard to justify keeping under these circumstances.
2020-06-21 11:04:33,Inconsistent and annoying,2,jcreativemonster,False,"The first time I used it everything worked. While it was a little slow, I was still able to download and watch a movie and several episodes of a series. Now with nothing in my queue I began another download and it reached around 30% and would just disappear from my list of downloads. I’ve tried several times with the same results. Extremely frustrating."
2020-06-20 14:33:48,The content is great but this app feels racist...,2,gkagshsnsk,False,I was really happy to get HBO Max cause me and my wife enjoy a lot of shows that they have...but when we got the app there were no subtitles in spanish or any other language at all... so now we feel excluded from enjoying your content since we are not so fluent in english...this is really sad it feels really bad that a company like this doesn’t care about the hispanics that really want to see their shows... it feels racist
2020-06-13 20:48:18,"Good start, but buggy.",2,crm25,False,"Overall, I like this app and the content. There's not a ton of content and I was hoping for a bit more DC but that's okay. 

My biggest problem at the moment is downloads. They do not continuously download if I'm not in the app and a bigger problem, when it says they're downloaded, I return to the app to find half my downloads have disappeared. I've downloaded the same shows/movies about 5 times now to no avail."
2020-06-03 22:32:37,Improvements Needed,3,anonymous08,False,When watching a show the next episode should play prior to the credits ending; automatically. There should be a skip intro option. Also why are you playing commercials for your other shows? We already pay for the hbo max you don’t need to promote to your subscribers. Netflix has all this figured out maybe they can help.
2020-07-18 09:59:05,Glitchy,3,jmcm90,False,"The app has some amazing titles, but when I am watching on my Apple TV, whatever I am watching gets interrupted multiple times with the same “Oops! Something went wrong” and I have to go back to the home page and start the show again. I’ve deleted and re-added the app, hard closed it and restarted it, still the same message. Very annoying."
2020-05-29 10:09:27,Still no subtitles after complaints from HBO Go,1,shatter714,False,"I immediately canceled my free subscription because I watch a lot of shows with my mom on Netflix in Spanish subtitles or audio. This app has nothing in Spanish ! Only actual Latino shows are in Spanish . You would think after all this time Hbo would finally add subtitles or audio after not doing it on HBO Go. This is why Netflix is the best streaming service and will remain the best because they cater to all people! Looks like I’m going back to Netflix, good try though !"
2020-07-19 00:10:19,Can’t view downloads offline,2,AwsmRington,False,"It’s incredibly frustrating that I download a title. Then when I’m on the go I see the option to view that download once. Only once.
Then all the app displays is “Cant Connect: We’re having issues connection to HBO Max right now. Please try again.”

I know you can’t connect. That’s why I downloaded the title to watch offline. What’s the purpose of this feature if not to view while without internet."
2020-07-16 05:13:43,It’s okay,3,workisrude,False,"Why isn’t there an option to select episodes from the continue watching section? I feel like this is important. I’m having to search and then select the episode I want to watch. 

Also I noticed there is not feature like the Netflix “are you still watching”.

Overall it’s alright. It has a clean design and just really basic."
2020-07-18 00:03:11,"It’s okay... love the content, apps okay.",2,Mrs.Dean Winchester,False,"I just hate that if you don’t have internet and you’ve downloaded episodes, it takes forever for it to load still like it’s searching for internet. It shouldn’t take that long. And also I could have extremely good service and it still buffers constantly and sometimes the app will shut me out completely when I try to go to just watch my downloads."
2020-07-16 16:23:52,Not functional,1,Lauren63846,False,"There are good shows and movies but none of the platforms-computer, tv or phone- are very user friendly. You can’t pick which episodes to watch you can only go in order and you can’t go backwards. I don’t like how on the computer if you’re in full screen when it goes to the next episode, it takes you out of full screen. Also you can’t download the app on a fire stick to watch. Overall there’s a lot of work that needs to be done"
2020-09-04 04:55:33,Closed Captioning,3,ashsydkastkat,False,"I think it’s nice that you have the option to customize closed captioning through your devices, but honestly it irks me that the subtitles aren’t centered and I don’t like the settings I have to choose from on my iPhone or Xbox one. I have never had this problem with any other streaming service, including HBOGo, so I’m not sure why this is the way it’s been done for HBOMax."
2020-07-11 04:19:03,I upgraded their rating!,5,1 Hot RN,True,"My initial rating got upgraded from one star to five when they made it accessible to those of us paying for traditional HBO through a cable subscription. Thank you HBO. They have a nice selection of stuff to watch, some of which really surprised me."
2020-06-27 15:52:35,ANTI-CHRISTIAN,1,Kai223344,False,"This services does not offer a single Christian, spiritual or religious movie. When I put in a well known title such as the passion of the Christ and countless other blockbuster titles, it gives me NOTHING except suggestions for non religious movies.  There is one movie that comes up but it is “silent” and I’m not sure how many people are interested in silent movies as I’m not. There are many many categories offered so everyone except Christians have something to choose from. I’m so tired of these companies attempting to  steer everyone away from God."
2020-08-03 15:55:51,PIN doesn’t protect adult profiles,3,at58522,False,"I feel like this is backwards. The PIN needs to unlock the adult profile. As it is right now, children can log into adult profiles if they aren’t already in their own. The PIN is only there to keep a child in the profile it’s already in. There are other services out there that have it set up to unlock adult profiles with the PIN. Please fix this!"
2020-09-01 07:11:07,Trilogies leaving like crazy!!!,1,Just tryna enjoy myself,False,"i can’t finish a single trilogy i like. i get HBO Max and start watching Harry Potter. i get half way through the movies (POOF) they're gone, so then i decided to watch the Hobbit. i watch the first movie THEN POOF GONE. i don’t even wanna try Lord of the Rings because it’ll be gone before i can finish it too!!! i get that they can’t always stay but a warning that they’ll be GONE the next day, it would be nice so i can actually binge them before they’re gone instead of watching them at normal past."
2020-06-10 22:43:54,Issues with Chromecast,3,LuxeGirlsGuide,False,Overall the service and programming is great you get all the HBO movies and shows plus older and new Turner television shows. The only big issue is that when I try to use the app with google chromecast I do not have audio. I tried checking everything and cannot seem to fix it. So I can only watch it from my phone and iPad which is a pain.
2020-07-08 00:24:48,Terrible launch,1,HeRatesApps,False,"The fact that HBO launched this new service without having contracts in place with all of their television providers to allow access to for us to use this app is very disappointing. Also the fact that there are now so many different HBO apps that do the same/various different things is terribly confusing. If this is the one app to rule them all, then you should probably work on giving all the people that pay for HBO television access to this app immediately."
2020-09-25 01:18:34,Can’t play title,3,Greenberg 1,False,"50/50 chance when trying to play a show I would get a “can’t play this title” message. No connectivity issue; other shows would play. I have had this problem trying to play several shows and not one in particular. 

The interface is great and a wonderful improvement from the previous app."
2020-10-03 06:17:01,Incredibly buggy app,1,flowcustomersince08,False,"When the app is not buffering interminably, there are connection errors — either to a particular show/film, or to the entire service. Other times the app claims I’m offline, and won’t load at all. This happens on average 50% of the time I try to play material from my iPad or Apple TV 4K. It is tremendously irritating. The company makes too much money and the subscription prices are too high (for a new and clearly under-tested service) to produce such horrendously unreliable apps."
2020-07-19 18:47:49,2 Stars,2,Bear7Care,False,"I was so excited when my cable provider had a free 30 day trial of HBO Max! I’m only giving 2 stars while the content is good, it’s disappointing that I’m unable to watch on my Roku, since an app is unavailable. I’ve resorted to hooking my laptop to my tv to watch my shows. The chrome cast ability is non existent, and has not worked once for us (brand new tv). I definitely won’t keep this app after my trial ends, it’s not worth the hype."
2020-07-13 13:12:34,Offline download issues,2,EP-V2,False,"Easy enough to download when online. The problem is when you don’t have a connection and you try to watch what has been downloaded. If you start watching, switch to another app, then switch back, you can’t get back into HBO Max to continue watching. It gives a Could Not Connect Error every time and doesn’t let you navigate to downloads page."
2020-07-17 19:35:33,Total BS!!!!!,1,MiamiVandal,False,"I’ve had HBO since it first arrived in Miami. As of July 31st I will never have it again! The fact that they want me to pay twice for the same service is ridiculous. I have HBO on my direct tv account, which I stream on my HBOGO on my other TVs. So HBO decides to no longer be carried by Roku. What genius came up with that idea! Did they not see the success of Disney+? This only shows me they don’t give a crap about the customers, only about making more money. So long HBO, say hi to CBS all access on your way down!"
2020-06-26 23:07:46,AirPlay and Interface has major issues,1,yaarlally11,False,"App continues to display error messages while trying to play using my iPhone 11 Pro. I had to fully close app multiples time every time I tried playing next episode. Interface has lot of empty places. Thumbnails can be tighten up to show more content on one page. Also, once you into an episode from homepage you don’t have the option to view other episode from the same page, you have to go search for it."
2020-06-12 18:02:40,Is there a way to Skip intro and end credits?,3,Maddie E 23,False,"HBO needs to include “skip intro” and “watch next episode” features on its interface. I have to fast forward every time I watch an episode. I’m currently watching “the wire” which, true to its time, has a super long intro and end credits. Netflix is on point with this, and HBO needs to step up its game to continue to be competitive in the streaming space."
2020-06-21 19:43:30,Difficult to work with,1,Weaverml52,True,"Edit due to developer’s response:

 I did every single thing to troubleshoot through the link provided and still not resolved. I can’t go anywhere after watching a movie/show because every where I try to go it spins and spins and spins and spins.....so I have to close the app and reopen. Horrible app navigation. 

I have the HBO max app on my Samsung TV. IT’s easy to browse and watch movies, no buffering or streaming issues during a movie playing. But every time I try to return home after watching a movie, it spins and spins. Literally for 5-10 minutes to the point I have to close the app and reopen it because it doesn’t seem to know what to do or how to get back to the home screen. It’s horrible! 

I’ll come back and give it more stars if this gets resolved."
2020-06-17 01:10:20,Add more content,4,christophercjcutrer,False,"Seriously, I love HBO and this HBO Max is a good idea. The app is good too, don’t get me wrong here, it’s a very good idea but I wish you could add more content that most of us haven’t seen. Everyone most likely seen all the movies in the app, so it would be great too add content that we haven’t seen yet. If you’re reading this, thank you for listening."
2020-05-28 04:59:47,Please fix this,3,fuzzy_foxx,False,First of all I love love love the selection. I mainly subscribed for Friends and Studio Ghibli movies but there is just one little issue that I am not content with. I have a Rokutv and currently I am unable to stream on my tv even though I am paying for HBO Max. To make it worse I couldn’t use my hdmi cord to split screens. I am so sad to subscribe to this service and not be able to use it on my big screen :(
2020-06-03 22:50:39,Life was so much simpler with just HBO Now,2,wxntrafficfan,False,"Good luck scrolling through movie or show selections on the Apple TV app. Any time I scroll through the movies, it crashes and I’m taken back to the home screen on my Apple TV. I thought, perhaps I should baby the Apple TV and scroll slowly. Nope. Still crashes. Then I have to scroll down to the HBO Max app, sign in again, scroll to the movies, and see how far I can get down the list before the app crashes again."
2020-05-28 01:27:05,Having Audio Issues,3,ohffkbfmss,False,There seems to be an issue with the sound mixing. I’m watching Spirited Away and the music is really loud while the dialogue from the characters is really low. It’s like this for both English and Japanese languages. I thought it was just me so I put on my Blu-ray copy and that sounds perfectly fine so I don’t know what’s going on here. Is anyone else having this same issue?
2020-10-07 06:08:04,Poor user interface,3,Mandizzledoo,False,"Great shows, horrible user interface for the iPhone. My controls (pause/play, fast-forward/rewind, etc.) constantly disappear every time I try to access them. I have to find the episode I was on and push play again to get the controls to come back up. Quite annoying for the high price!!"
2020-05-27 18:27:07,Works Perfectly and Seamlessly,5,CraigT09,False,"I have a DIRECTV account with an HBO subscription and it could not have been easier to sign in using my current password. If it doesn’t work for you, then you are the problem that needs to be fixed."
2020-05-27 14:26:37,Can’t verify your subscription,5,HRRSAK,False,"It would be nice to use a service you pay for. I will change the review once I actually can see something to review but until I can actually watch something with this service, it deserves a 1 star review"
2020-06-26 00:31:08,No WiFi makes using app difficult,3,Sir Hikesalot,False,"I don’t have WiFi. When I first got this app I was able to stream movies and TV shows but, now I am required to download movies and TV shows. It takes an awful long time to download a  two and a half hour movie. I have to download it while I sleep and watch the next evening. I won’t be getting a lot of use out of this app."
2020-08-14 18:59:02,Problems logging in,1,cynnief,False,"I received HBOMAX when I signed up AT&T almost a month ago. I have it for one year. I can watch it on my TV but I cannot watch it on my iPhone or iPad. I could for 2 weeks and it kicked me off and no matter what trouble shooting steps I go through it will NOT let me log in. I have called for help 2 times. No one could help.....I am still Not able to watch on my my phone or iPad. 
What is your Suggestion ??? 
I switched from Verizon and the transition has NOT been smooth. 
HELP ‼️"
2020-07-01 01:48:04,Fix the feature that continuously plays once I fall asleep,2,hbb2008,False,As much as I hate Netflix “are you still watching “ feature; It’s very much needed and appreciated now that hbo max doesn’t have this function. I fall asleep watching Friends and wake up in the morning and I’ve smiled through 2 seasons as a time. Even when I have my tv sleep timer on. I use chromcast to cast to my tv and after the tv turns off it continues to stream. 😠
2020-06-28 02:31:50,So many bugs,2,MrsRivero,False,"I want to like the app, I do. But one day I can stream while doing other things on my phone and the next day, the app has to be open and then phone cannot go to sleep without interrupting the stream. Lots of “sorry, having trouble playing this content right now” messages being displayed. Content is great, but an actual Apple TV app or Visio smart tv app would be great. So many kinks still need to be worked out."
2020-05-30 15:41:22,But a great launch,2,pschwartz89,False,"All the fanfare for this service and then it’s released without full ability to send to a larger TV screen unless you have some specific services.  Given how pervasive HBO is and the number of cable and satellite users that purchase their product, one would think that more consideration would’ve been given to that group bs only those that stream or watch TV from a PlayStation console.  It’s disappointing."
2020-05-28 02:37:40,Auto-updated to an app I can no longer use?,1,josh_inc,False,"I have a subscription to HBO Now, but for some reason I can’t access it on any of my devices anymore because they all updated to HBO Max?

Here’s a brilliant idea, if you haven’t figured out the licensing through some providers, don’t remove support for the app that actually works until you’ve figured out an alternative.

Non-sensical that overnight this app changed names and now will not allow me to sign back in. Way to bungle a roll-out."
2020-09-15 05:27:14,Poor performance,1,CM Stan,False,"Where to start? The image quality is noticeably worse than the major competitors. 
For some reason the menu runs at what seems like 4 frames per second or so on my PS4 pro although runs fine on Apple TV so something is definitely up with the optimization. 
The previous app was fine there was really nothing wrong with it from a user perspective. 
Not sure why they would go backwards. Smells like money or favors.
Someone at HBO screwed up on this one."
2020-08-27 13:09:45,Can’t sign in if you have an account.,1,iviewer99,False,"For some ridiculous reason, only primary account holders can make an hbo max account. I have an account I used it for years on hbo go, so did my 4 other family members. Now the accounts are useless. Can’t watch anything on any of my hbo apps. Would rather stop watching all together than shell out another 15 to use your app. Allow all hbo account holders to access hbo max please. Miss hbo go, get rid of this garbage and bring back an app that works."
2020-08-06 18:17:12,Dropped the ball,1,breaker930,False,"HBO forces our hands into downloading and transitioning to hbo max and the amount of bugs is unreal. Where to begin...offline media downloads rarely play. On today’s flight, the app didn’t even give me the option to access my offline downloads. Switch out of the app to check a text or an email and it will redirect you to the home screen and not the video you were watching. Very disappointing- would not recommend. I’m canceling my subscription."
2020-07-08 02:48:42,Keeps crashing on AppleTV,1,almostmillionmiler,False,"Continual crashes.  Sometimes when you open, sometimes when you pause a show, trying to browse to movies, or wherever, every time a crash and restart with “Ooops something went wrong....”. 
Usually takes 3-4 tries to get a show to start playing.   Don’t touch anything, don’t pause, don’t rewind or skip ahead.   Horrible.  So frustrating.  Tried rebooting AppleTV, Tried deleting and reinstalling the App.  Nothing works.  HBO Go was great, HBO Max is an absolute dumpster fire."
2020-07-02 04:23:17,Impossible to access easily...,1,Blueyedgirl316,False,"Honestly I would have nothing but good things to say if it weren’t for the fact that they make it near impossible to watch easily on many different devices. For those that don’t have the most current and up to date TVs, iPads, tablets or whatever their service doesn’t support older devices. So unless I wanna go out and buy a newer TV or iPad then I’m screwed to watch all that they have to offer. Please for the love of god HBO please fix this issue!"
2020-07-22 19:28:16,Cellular warning pop up,3,One issue,False,Just started using the app and it’s annoying how many times the warning that I’m streaming using data pops up. I hit dismiss but it comes up again in 10 seconds. Sometimes like 8 times in a row before it finally stops popping up. Then with a new episode pop up warning starts over again. Please fix.
2020-09-29 02:26:34,"Good content, horrible connection",2,Hopehopeysmiles,False,"They have a lot of good content on this app. However, that’s completely ruined by the constant buffering. I can’t get through more than 20 minutes of a movie or series without it buffering for a total of five minutes. It’s not my internet connection. Every other streaming service works perfectly fine. Fix your app. It’s not worth subscribing for this."
2020-09-27 23:06:11,Auto play keeps playing shows after quitting app,2,Dirk Dee Dirk,False,"We need to be able to turn off auto play. We will leave off on sat, episode 2 of a season and then come back and will see on the  continue watching section that it’s at episode 9.  This happens on Xbox whether we quit the app or not. This is wasting my bandwidth. Please pass this on to whom ever can fix this. And get the dang app on fire stick already!"
2020-08-28 17:46:58,Here for the max content,5,markbyrn,True,"There's very little original content from HBO that would entice me to subscribe but with this max service, a huge library of classic TV & movie content from past decades is made available. That's definitely worth the price of admission."
2020-08-05 00:44:58,Not my fav,2,mishi782,False,.  However I do love the fact that I have access to every season of South Park but where is every season of vice news Definitely needs more improvements and tweaking seems like all my shows that I wanna watch like vice news show the main reason i signed up for HBO are not there to watch. all they have are the special reports ones.  where are seasons one through whatever six or something
2020-07-02 00:59:02,Could be better,3,AlfaMarck,False,The subtitle are huge and the fast forwarding or going back is a struggle and can easily go to far forward or back. No option to automatically go to the next is also frustrating and not consumer friendly. Just a few changes that would make the experience much more enjoyable.
2020-06-22 02:47:44,Buggy - not worth the switch from HBO Now,2,Camille.Tam,False,"App is terrible. First it's not compatible with my Apple TV. Sure, it's an older version but I'm still not pleased. Now it won't download on my iPad pro... and even on my iPhone, scrolling is hit or miss. I can't scroll to read more on any ""about"" screens. 

All in all a net negative compared to HBO Now. I don't care how much more content there is if I can't access it, in fact now I'm paying to NOT access it."
2020-05-27 16:43:03,Auto play feature,5,Robregon,False,Great collection can’t wait to see more - but really Wish there was an auto play feature - like an auto play on series episodes - and or auto play on the lists of movies we saved.
2020-10-09 04:28:03,Doesn’t Work,1,Merdizzie,False,"Great content but I can’t see any of it. The app freezes and won’t open. I’ve deleted the app and reinstalled it but it hasn’t helped. I was able to get a film started and on my Apple TV using air play (I have a vs 1 Apple TV which doesn’t carry HBO Max) but it freaked out and stopped working. It told me to check my internet connection, but my wifi is completely working. Sadly I can’t use my Roku either because HBO and Roku are having a fight over who knows what."
2020-08-25 23:17:13,Glitchy,4,cflamenco,False,"I love the content and the app. The only major problem I have with it is when I’m on my iPhone and I’m watching a show, if I have to go to my home screen the app closes in the background. I have to restart the app all over again to continue watching. It’s very annoying."
2020-06-26 07:06:08,Hmmm,3,Kaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay K,False,The new shows are great. However the app crashes on me a lot. It says there’s no internet when there clearly is. The prompt for no internet will pop up during my shows often. Yet the show keeps playing so clearly- the internet works. Also wish firestick and roku would update so I didn’t have to watch shows on my phone.
2020-07-22 04:36:58,Really?,3,Deetzter,False,"HBOMax can, and should, do better.   The autoplay is horrible.  I fall asleep and have to go back and figure out where I left off.  Having to click around to get to the full library of a particular show is lame.  
Like expanded content. But it wouldn’t be hard to improve the user experience by making basic changes to the app"
2020-06-05 15:23:38,Scam,1,Fantastique Choque,True,"Update: after reading the developer’s response, I would rather pay for Friends separately than give another dollar to this crap company. 

The service isn’t supported by Roku or Fire Stick. They fail to mention this before charging you, and they also refuse to issue a refund as it is “against policy.” I guess scamming their customers is not against policy. I wonder how much money they made off of charging people who can’t use the service and then refusing to refund them."
2020-09-06 16:56:16,Love the APP,4,smlliw,False,"App worked great I download movies and shows to my iPad and watch in my rv on my tv thru HDMI connection recently in last few days I now only get audio no video have you changed something in the app since last update very disappointed since I use this while traveling

Thanks Greg"
2020-09-05 10:09:39,Minor problems,4,xzteer,False,I came close to giving this a 5 stars but what bothers me is the fact I keep getting logged out from my account randomly and it’s getting annoying having to sign in many times. Other than that I’m very excited for your upcoming originals for 2021.
2020-08-19 03:05:19,Rushed to blocked sharing I’m guessing,2,CA_DC,False,"The app is too glitchy to release.  Chromecasting during adverts throw exceptions and you have to restart.  Interface is inconsistent and nonintuitive. 

There is no thought to error handling or messaging... shouldn’t have to research forums to sign in with my own account - unlike the dozen other streaming apps where it works.

I guess they don’t care cause they have the content? Meh hbo is getting over rated anyway..."
2020-08-02 21:13:08,Can’t stream on Roku TV,2,1329jdj,False,"Okay HBO, I get that streaming services are fighting with platforms, trying to establish who has more power in this next era of how we consume media. But it’s common sense that I’m more likely to stream from a different service than to replace my Roku tv so I can watch HBO Max. You’re not going to win, so get crap settled so I can watch TBBT on my tv instead of my phone or I’m just going to cancel my subscription and this app is going to tank."
2020-06-28 21:35:31,Can only see on one device,1,Townecrafter,False,I bought HBO MAX  because I was having surgery and wanted to watch movies while recovering. Now I’m home for 2 months in a neck brace and can only see HBO MAX on my iPad even though I have an Apple Device set up for the big screen TV. The only HBO on my Apple is HBO Now and it won’t let me sign in.   So I have to stack pillows high enough on my lap to see the iPad which still strains my neck. I have tried everything. A waste of time and money. Too bad. There were some good movies
2020-07-20 06:20:36,Movie ideas to put out in HBO,5,slime unicorn22,False,Why not put the movie the boy 1 and the boy 2 it would really help people when they are stuck in lockdown. The app is amazing I get to watch old horror movies with my family when we are stuck in the house
2020-06-23 07:21:55,App will not open,1,bbecker756,False,"The app will not open on my iPad. I have tried all of the suggestions on the troubleshooting page (reinstalling, restarting the iPad, making sure my software is up-to-date, etc.) and nothing works. I now want to cancel my subscription, since I can’t use the app. However, when I try to sign in on chrome, the webpage asks me to download the app. Apparently the only way to cancel the subscription is through the app, WHICH IS NOT WORKING! What a waste of money!"
2020-06-11 08:57:16,Auto play feature,3,bwsly,False,Please change the “ cellular data usage” message after every episode when not on wifi. Or at least give an option where I can click don’t show this message again. I would rate higher if you had a smooth auto play feature while using cellular data.
2020-06-14 19:19:59,"Needs work,  I think",2,Tx__Farmboy,False,"Been using this app now for a few weeks.  I download content to watch offline during breaks.  When I open my iPad (WiFi only), it tells me it can’t connect to app and I am forced to use a hotspot to watch downloaded content.  Once I connect, I have to re-sign in.   Shows are starting back at beginning.  There shouldn’t be a reason I am unablemmwatch downloads while offline.  Right?  Help!"
2020-06-14 02:58:46,Downgrade from HBO Now,2,cbmartella,False,This new app is not very good. The video playback when starting or continuing a series does not always work right. The video will stop playing even after pressing play. Also where is the Siri search. Why am I still having to type in letters instead of using the voice remote. HBO Now just worked and I never experienced an issue. HBO Max is inconsistent and does not always work correctly.
2020-06-19 21:59:42,Offline watching,3,Burrburrmac,False,Great app! Love all of the choices and the general flow of the app is very easy to navigate BUT I downloaded some titles to watch when I was going to be off WiFi and there was no way to access them! When there is no access to WiFi the app does not even load so I am unable to make my way to the downloads....please fix this!!!
2020-05-28 20:33:40,Add more lists?,5,Shanhftrx,False,"Love this app so far. Can’t wait to binge watch Dr Who. But can you guys please make it so we can have more than one list? Like I’m going trough Looney Tunes and picking out my favorites, but would like to put them in a separate list. All the Roadrunners in another list and so on."
2020-08-20 23:26:46,Account =/= Subscription,1,AquariusBat,False,"Used my free trial for an exclusive third season of a popular show (thanks for excluding half the fanbase on that one)! I cancelled my free trial/subscription and there’s no feasible way to actually DELETE MY ACCOUNT. Not subscription, ACCOUNT. Literally ANY OTHER SUBSCRIPTION SERVICE / PAYWALL HAS A DELETE MY ACCOUNT BUTTON ON THEIR APP. HOW HARD IT IS IT TO PROGRAM A BUTTON. 

Good choices I guess, though I can find most of them on better services. Horrible UI and Help/Customer Service. I SHOULDN’T have to go to call another company to DELETE MY HBO MAX ACCOUNT."
2020-08-12 17:19:49,Wish HBO GO was still operational,2,Nina NahNo,False,I know things change but not sure why HBO decided to get rid of a proven app like HBO GO. I used it for years and quite frankly was highly disappointed in the forced switch. Not to mention there most certainly would be bugs and kinks in the new app. Seems like they could have let the MAX app be piloted a bit longer before forcing everyone to leave the other apps.
2020-07-20 18:32:10,Chrome cast,2,hxhfjdjbrh,False,This is so annoying. When I download the app it says “hey check out the chrome cast option” and then when I sign in and try to use it it disappears. One reason why I keep using other services because this one I cast cast to my TV. And plus they released the app before it was on roku so I can’t watch it in there. Overall a super rushed release and seems like they will pay for it because of that.
2020-06-25 20:06:25,A lot to learn.. apparently.,1,dmcarter416,False,"This app is a mess, strange because the previous HBO apps have had issues but were at least functional and things easily found. So many scroll errors and poor layout choices boggle the mind. 

And if trying to be a big hitter in streaming, have basic things on a show page like recaps and trailers. This whole experience needs to be overhauled if the intent really is to drop the other HBO apps. I’m embarrassed on behalf of the designers and managers."
2020-05-28 19:29:48,HBO Max,3,Bobbyisaninjew,False,"Wether it’s the hbo side or the apple side something somewhere isn’t right. I enjoy the selection well worth 15 bucks a month. However I’ve had the app less than an hour and problems are there. Title pictures not loading, videos not loading after ad breaks, app freezing. That’s what’s happened so far. Hopefully bugs resolved soon."
2020-06-15 23:09:41,Awful can’t even describe this experience,1,Chabot20,False,"So my AT&T wireless plan includes HBO Max.  I tried online for an hour to connect the 2.   After changing the user ID and then trying to combine an account I called AT&T. Was put on hold 25 minutes, the agent that answered worked on it 5 minutes then said he had to connect to the tech department.  He did not stay on the phone and then I was entered into the beginning of the AT&T que. I tried to get to tech support and then was hung up on."
2020-06-13 22:09:56,Offline Downloads Don’t Work,2,scrmbldmegz,False,"Good content and pretty app. Way more cons though. HBO has gotten a huge head charging 15/month. Also, I often don’t have WiFi, so I download episodes to watch offline. Half the time, during these episodes, I have to skip ahead 15 seconds and miss things. Gets on my nerves severely. Hire someone who works for Netflix’s app design to fix this buggy mess. Also, no Roku app? Sigh. All around not good."
2020-05-31 01:40:57,"Love HBO Max, but...",4,ayhsek,False,"I love the platform and every content, but my parents don’t know English that much and there’s no option for me to change language. I hope there’ll be an option in the future for me to change the audio so my family can understand what they’re watching."
2020-05-27 16:03:42,Bummed about accessibility,3,ShellyWilim,False,"I was so excited to finally be able to launch HBO Max but was immediately aggravated that I couldn’t download the app on any of my devices (Roku, Firestick, LG smart tv). I can only watch from my iPhone then airplay it to my smart tv but it’s not as seamless as other apps. I really wish they would make this app more accessible because then it would be perfect."
2020-05-27 19:05:40,10x better than Netflix,5,2k fix this,False,"Has everything I could have ever wanted. Whenever I watch Netflix, I search for an hour trying to find something good to watch. With max it seems like every show and movie is high quality."
2020-05-27 17:27:57,The Fyre Festival of Streaming Apps,1,Dealthlok,False,"App is broken. Says my provider doesn’t support it, but my providers are AT&T and HBO. If AT&T doesn’t support it, why did you develop it? AT&T is 40% of all mobile users! The single largest mobile user base in the country! Who doesn’t support it? HBO? 

Releasing an unsupported product that doesn’t function in place of a functioning one your customer has paid for is called fraud. Publishing a mobile app not supported by the largest mobile carrier (or by yourselves) is just dumb imho."
2020-07-16 03:23:52,"Basic app, lacks customizations",3,Peach383,False,"Would love to be able to select a different episode from the continue watching selection or view the show title page. Where is the feature to turn off auto play? Auto play is nice, but more of an inconvenience. Clearly the app was not well thought out and rushed to market."
2020-09-24 19:50:23,No 4K?,2,dtringaaa,False,"It’s absurd to me that HBO would release their streaming service without 4K. Every other major streaming service offers this. HBO, one of the biggest entertainment companies in the world, can definitely afford to make this happen and for some reason they didn’t find it important enough. 4K is a standard in homes now and by the time HBO makes this happen 8k will be starting to become just as popular."
2020-08-08 05:20:54,HBO FAIL,1,Steven Evans,False,"What a terrible way to treat your customers who used HBO NOW to stream. To replace the app entirely cutting off their access from streaming on their devices is really unconscionable. I’ll be unsubscribing from HBO from here on out since I can’t get it on my devices and that was one of the primary ways I was accessing it. You didn’t have to be awful to these customers, you could’ve created another app without discontinuing the HBO NOW app. But you chose to be terrible to these customers."
2020-07-11 21:49:44,I can’t download things,5,chomy1219,False,"I love the app! But I try to download something! When I turn my WiFi off for the road, It says “having trouble connecting to HBO MAX” I can’t even reach the downloads! Can you please fix this? UPDATE never mind! I figured it out!"
2020-06-13 03:24:20,Airplay needs attention.,3,belate1234,False,Overall the app content is good but the airplay inconsistency is frustrating!  I can usually get one episode to play normally through airplay then when it switched to the next episode it loses connection we can’t get it reconnected. Doesn’t make a difference if I’m trying to live stream it or download it same issue.
2020-05-28 17:06:20,It’s ok I just wish I could hear,3,lesexypanda,False,"I downloaded the app and I like the selection of what I can watch but my issue is I can’t hear anything at all. I test my headphones to maybe see if it was that but my music, podcasts are all playing normally so I don’t understand why I can’t hear in the app. I saw on reddit that a lot of people are having this issue as well."
2020-09-03 19:37:27,Loading,3,Drake Clay.,False,"Great content but I have to often delete the app and redownload it due to poor streaming. It will tell me it cannot play any title over and over again, blaming my internet as if it’s my fault. Total bs. The only way to resolve it is redownloading which is incredibly annoying and anger inducing. But other than that, the content is incredible."
2020-05-27 21:25:09,Small user interface problem,4,Chazrunner,False,"I am enjoying the content however, when I request information on a series it doesn’t allow me to scroll, so the bottom text is cut off. I think this could be an easy fix for the developers."
2020-05-27 18:58:46,Content Heaven!,5,Dancing Thor,False,"I already was subscribed to HBO GO before and updated my account for HBOMAX. Just finished going through movies and tv shows from A-Z and my watchlist is now packed! Looney Tunes (old and new!) current DC films, and so much more! I was really surprised how diverse and broad the content is and it’s only day 1. 
Worth it!"
2020-05-27 18:48:19,In Case You Missed It,4,[Brian C],False,"Apple TV is on Roku. So if you have a Roku device then get the HBO Max through the Apple TV Roku channel app.

Since I haven’t tried out this app yet and have to rate before a review I’ll give a rating of 4 because I am familiar with HBO and other Warner associated material and have always enjoyed the experience I get from them."
2020-05-27 17:42:40,Why?,4,machaelak,False,Why on earth would you put out a streaming service that’s isn’t available on a large portion of people’s televisions? I can only stream it on my phone which is just completely annoying. I love the service itself but come on. That wasn’t a smart move.
2020-10-19 20:01:33,Best content out there,5,Alexander Brown,False,I was really impressed with HBO Max content. Not only it has the original HBO content but also seems to have every latest movie. I don’t think I would need to keep my Netflix or Disney+ subscription with HBO Max around
2020-10-14 07:47:45,Invoices are confusing,1,Beetle Ragtop,False,"Of course, that’s the plan.  I get three (at least) notifications of what I owe each month for directv and each is completely different.   Same holds  true for cell service.  I don’t know how people keep track of these balances!!!!!!   Simplify your invoices.  Send one, not three completely different bills.  So frustrating!!!!!!!  Verizon: 1 invoice each month.  Comcast:  1 invoice each month.  So simple and no confusion whatsoever.  Fix the mess please!!!!!"
2020-10-03 21:24:37,Rick and morty season four malfunction,5,GAMER PUG133167,False,"I honestly want to give five stars so bad, but  Rick and morty season four was suppose to be out October 1 and it is October 3 . I am watching the series and it won’t let me, I’ve tried to see if there’s a update but there is none ."
2020-09-05 13:46:15,Half-Finished App,2,chasling,False,Downloading movies and episodes for offline viewing is consistently terrible. These issues are device and connection independent. The UI needs improvement too. For example when scrolling lists the list displays on the far left side of the screen while there's no touch response when interacting with the corresponding row on the right side of the screen.
2020-09-08 03:24:42,Sound is too low,3,juanc07,False,I love the Max and it’s selections. The only issue that I have is that the sound on all of the shows or movies is way too low. I have to turn my tv up almost all of the way in order to hear some of the dialogue. None of my other streaming apps on my Apple TV have this problem. Other than that it’s great.
2020-08-16 00:20:48,Everything is great but bugs,4,Anna Woodbury,False,I love this app all its shows and movies but every time you want to watch something it just random stop that you have to repeatedly refresh everything to get to the end of the movie or show and it’s very annoying
2020-08-15 19:57:46,Good when it works!,1,Ausmjen,False,"After we watch a program/ movie, it won’t reload to main screen. Dots just go across the bottom of the screen. After a couple days (if we’re lucky!) we can access again and watch something. I thought it was fixed for a bit, but I was wrong. Subscribed early for discounted rate. I haven’t cancelled yet, hoping it would get better... it’s not. Too much $$ to only get to watch one thing, once a week."
2020-06-29 16:59:26,Needs Updating,2,Fillyy20,False,"Sometimes the app won’t even open up. Not sure why, but it sits on the opening screen kinda looks like it’s loading but never actually does. 
If you download shows/episodes don’t count on watching them if you don’t have internet. 
If you don’t have internet don’t count on getting into the app at all, whether it’s just to see your downloads or anything."
2020-05-31 04:45:11,Cannot Log In,1,BrianHarrison24,False,"I have had a HBO Now subscription for over a year and had no problems logging in. When the app updated, I have not been able to log in and it says it’s not supported. I’m paying for a service that I cannot access because HBO has not updated the supported devices. They shouldn’t push an update if they cannot support devices that people use to access it. HBO should at least give back our money if we cannot use it."
2020-10-06 17:28:06,"Again , like others, good content, terrible interface",2,Skrapmot,False,"Good content, especially the HBO specific, Last Week Tonight, GOT, The Wire, Curb your Enthusiasm, etc.
Why can’t the app pull up my content better, why is there no Picture in Picture??! I work on my IPad and often would like to watch HBO while checking my mail or other tedious task.
Also, the Roku thing is ridiculous, please get that fixed."
2020-09-11 03:44:58,Can’t get connected through cable provider,1,bsharvill,False,I am using an iPad and have never had issues logging in to the app until this week.  Now I cannot get past the dial of death as the app sits and thinks... very frustrating.  The connectivity of this app with cable providers leaves something to desire.  I have lost two hours waiting that I will never get back.  I do not recommend this app if you are using a cable account to access.
2020-08-23 04:30:59,good buut,4,ima cool kid😘,False,I love hbo max and they have a great variety of shows and movies. Not much wrong but if your kids account for something you have to put in your “pin” for it. I don’t recall making one. Please fix this because I have to delete and download this app again and again.
2020-08-01 22:22:15,Terrible,1,Psuk10,False,"This app isn’t supported on Firetv. Are you kidding me? What is the most readily available, most purchased tv on the market? Firetvs. I guess I watching hbo on my phone now? Absolutely not. Fix this problem! What a terrible roll out. If you haven’t struck a deal with fire tv don’t take the service of HBO go away from your subscribers. Really infuriating. And from looking at the app on my phone content looks basically the same so why the new, less functional app?"
2020-10-16 02:37:11,Content is great but there needs to be Dolby Atmos/Vision support and an app for LG televisions,3,iOSLuke,False,"The content is great, especially the original content, however, it is disappointing for their to not be a smart tv app for new LG televisions. Also, there needs to be Dolby Atmos and Dolby Vision for the content as that is offered with other streaming services. Without it, the content on HBO Max seems less premium."
2020-06-16 05:26:28,Superb,4,Mr Optimist.7,False,Superb Video and Amazing Audio on iPhone speakers. Such a cinematic experience on my XS Max. Love it. Will stay subscribed due to awesome loud surround audio and video which covers full screen for iPhone. Glad I subscribed. Wish there recommendations were better and annoying profile chooser window goes away for a single profile user.
2020-06-12 21:52:14,I like it but ...,4,Lizzyfer_85,False,I recently purchased my fiancé a Roku in the huge hopes that he would be able to Stream HBO max that he would be able to watch it in his apartment without me so I can get some sleep. I realize your app is fairly new but I are you  Planning on having a stream across all platforms?
2020-06-05 17:49:58,Good so far...,4,NicoleTashai,True,"I like the options that are offered but my only complaint is when watching a tv series, and it goes to the next episode, the viewing screen on my computer gets small again...why?? Other than that, app seems good thus far."
2020-10-20 07:05:07,One star,1,Sheed95,False,"I don’t think Im gonna keep the subscription because I can only watch the app on my IPhone but when I connect it to my smart tv it just plays the HBO preview then when it gets time for the movie to play it just buffers for ever, & I know my WIFI is A1 because everything else plays just fine on other apps. 

Ps: it’s crazy because as I’m making this review the move starts to play but has no volume yo it now. Smh I can’t win for losing 🤦🏾‍♂️"
2020-07-02 01:21:23,Love the content but HATE having to cast,3,*Pyper*,False,Can HBO just come to a deal with Roku already? Or prime? Or have an app in Xfinity menu? Soooo many options now yet the only way I can watch it on my tv is to cast it? Chromecast has so many issues in itself that it makes me not even want to use the app. Seriously might cancel until these things are resolved
2020-10-12 20:34:41,HBO Max Review,4,JimmysReviews,False,This is my favorite streaming app because I don’t end up spending more time searching then watching and they have some good Shows/Movies on here. My only problem is that they don’t have an app on the fire stick just regular HBO which doesn’t have everything That HBO Max has
2020-10-09 22:51:29,Most Frustrating Apps,1,Logan777432,False,HBO has always had the most frustrating apps. From HBO Go to HBO now they’ve always been horrible and HBO Max is no different. Now and Go frequently had issues with buffering but at least I could watch the shows. It’s been months and HBO still hasn’t reached an agreement with Roku so I am unable to watch on my phone or laptop. I will once again be canceling my subscription once I finish binge watching the latest series.
2020-09-13 20:39:58,HBO MAX-Maximum Frustration,1,Maximum Relaxin,False,"I have enjoyed a subscription for years.  I am cancelling because the updated app not only does NOT work on my FireTV  for some reason some compatibility issues.  Additionally, the app on my portable devices does not download content for viewing off-line.  I have an incredible signal in my house on my wi-fi.  Other content has no problem downloading—-just this app is problematic.  None of this was ever the case before the updated HBO -MAX came out.  EPIC FAIL!!"
2020-08-03 02:44:01,What a nightmare this app is.,1,phllllp,False,"Just trying to relax and watch some tv and all of a sudden I find myself spending over an hour juggling devices, applying updates, signing into accounts, and reading FAQ after FAQ to get this thing connected to my tv. All for it to continuously freeze up every time I try to cast it from my phone. You’d think HBO would have this process hammered out before forcing everyone over - I guess not. Certainly not impressed here."
2020-05-27 16:30:37,No SPANISH language option,3,Jht89,False,"Kinda disappointed that HBO MAX isn’t launching with the option to view its shows in Spanish,,not even subtitles. I know they offer it when you watch HBO on TV, so they definitely have the capability. I know for many people in the Latino community this might be a deal breaker. Hopefully they update and include it in the future."
2020-06-27 22:40:51,Can’t see my entire list,1,AFD018,False,"Using this app on our Apple TV. I just added a ton of things to My List, but can’t seem to access it. I see the my list section on the home page, but you can only scroll to the right and it shows about 20 things I added then stops. 

There’s much more that I added and can’t access. Super frustrating. When you click on browse, there isn’t a My List option. How can I see all that I added?"
2020-05-30 04:01:58,Worst parental controls ever!,2,NixinLALA,False,"If you open the app on appletv anyone can play the adult profile. So kids can just log into the adult side when they open the app. IF they are on the kids side then they need a pin to SWITCH to the other profile. There should be an option for you to always have to put in the pin to get into the Adult profile. It’s basically useless. 

Also the layout isn’t great."
2020-05-28 05:49:53,A Great App,5,x5hadowH4wkx,False,"Netflix watch you’re back. Lol So far I have been in joying this app the since its release. You’ll definitely become a couch Potato within minutes. The app is not hard to maneuver if you’ll familiar with HBO Now. Long story short...  So Many Movies, SO MAnY ShoWS!!!"
2020-10-08 05:10:32,A huge problem that needs to be fixed,3,sparkdableeze,False,"When using smart cast, the volume is preset at max. If you go to adjust it it turns your tv all the way up and you have to turn it down.... why is set at full blast? It should be set to my phones volume. Wake up the whole family and blow out your speakers....."
2020-06-30 17:48:22,Inaccessible application,2,Blind guys minds eye,False,"I would like to echo some of these other users comments. In addition, it is not accessible to screen reader users. There are those of us that use voiceover on the iPhone and iPad. Blind users enjoy listening to shows as well. I cannot navigate this application because it is not marked up properly for screen reader use. HBO, you have a lot of financial resources, please remedy this."
2020-10-04 09:38:34,Not casting,1,xreese6x,False,Randomly stopped casting from my phone to tv this week. Did everything it says from deleting the app to contacting chromecast. Netflix and prime video work fine being casted but HBO Max just gives me a black screen that’s just loading and gives up. Even the rep at HBO that I’ve been talking to fix this problem doesn’t even know and keeps saying is that all for today. What the hell am I paying for when it’s not working.
2020-09-24 19:47:29,Can’t even log in,1,imsui,False,"Won’t even let me sign on via my service provider which is ATT U VERSE. Tried reinstalling, deleting tv provider on iPad settings, nothing works. I like the content but like others have said, app is garbage.

EDIT: downloaded the update today and thought it would fix the problems on my iPad Pro. Nope, still won’t even let me sign in, just hangs there after I enter my details. As useless as ever, wasting my space on iPad."
2020-09-06 14:47:00,Please get hbomax on lg content store,1,walshie77,False,I love hbomax but I can’t use it anymore. It’s not available in my App Store for my LG tv and that’s how I watch everything. I had it on my PS4 but can’t use that anymore. Please put HBOMAX on all platforms. It’s not fair to the customer that we have to buy an additional product to use this service when we already have places that we watch streaming services. Your attention to this glaring hole in service would be appreciated
2020-08-30 05:47:45,Does not work for At&T accounts,1,sashastories,False,"Tried logging in to my hbo max account with my HBO plan.  I have the account that comes with HVO max. On the apps loving page under At&t accounts my credentials don’t work. I called ATT customer service and they also said it should work with my plan and could not figure it out. 

Can someone please fix this bug or stop advertising that your service works with Att accounts. please. I’m now definitely never paying for HBO max."
2020-06-28 03:54:33,Closed Captioning,3,alonsoaguilar,False,"Closed captioning is fine on mobile devices but when I watch HBO Max on my smart tv the CC are so big they sometimes block the view of the content. They are all over the place, make them smaller and maybe don’t move them as much because they are so larger than I’m used to! It’s kind of annoying!"
2020-06-16 05:25:27,Sleep Timer,3,thanelees,False,"Love the app and all of the content, but if I put on a show to fall asleep to, I don’t think it should just keep playing forever until I stop it. I’ve come back a day later to see my show jump another 7 seasons. Add a way for me to stop playing after a certain number of episodes and I’ll rate a 5."
2020-09-06 07:42:22,I love it just not for my Hispanic family,3,Julio Garcia 26,False,"My family is a huge fan of HBO. When we tried to watch a couple of films, the only available language is English. My family was disappointed as we have seen various films on HBO that are in Spanish. We are very please with Netflix and Disney plus as it offers other languages"
2020-06-10 06:20:51,Need option to turn off autoplay,4,Biruvia,False,"It’s a video app that does all you want it to do, except when you want it to stop. The fact that you can’t turn off autoplay - where one episode automatically continues to the next in a series - makes no sense."
2020-05-28 19:09:45,Make sure it’s compatible,2,CDarden14,False,"I was very excited for HBO Max, mainly so I can watch Friends anywhere and anytime. However, I can only watch on my tablet in phone. (Didn’t know this until after I started the subscription) I have ROKU TVs throughout my entire home and news stories say the “company hasn’t reached an agreement” to allow ROKU users to add it to their TVs. Will likely not renew until this problem is solved."
2020-05-27 23:26:01,No app on my firestick makes it useless.,1,Brynstar75,False,"I already pay for HBO through Comcast, so it’s annoying that I have to pay additional for the Max service, but I was interested in the content so I was still willing to pay it. To find out that I can’t access it through Firestick or my backup Roku is a deal breaker. It’s a poor business choice not to have this worked out before release and made me immediately cancel my subscription."
2020-09-21 14:29:27,Major flop by HBO,1,Pandafet,False,"Programmers need to come up work a better interface. Nice selection of programs, although several original HBO shows and movies are not available such as Hysterical Blindness. Why? Just open the entire library. 

Tons of bugs. App crashes for no reason. This is 100% the app and not my smart phone or TV. Show freezes and tries to reload and then I need to exit reboot the app. 

With all the revenue that HBO has - why not make it great?!"
2020-09-09 02:42:20,Pay for now but can’t use max,1,Truths4Now,False,I have been paying for HBO now but find out the new HBO shows are only on HBO max that can not be streamed on my Roku. I instantly canceled my HBO now subscription and will not pay for MAX until they add it to Roku. Research your target market it’s not people on laptops and cell phones. It’s people streaming on TVs. Why would I pay the same amount of money for half the shows. Fix your app put HBO On Roku and other streaming services it’s not hard.
2020-08-28 01:18:39,Better version of HBO Go,3,21ketack,False,"The app is great and works well with my Chromecast. The only problem, which has become quite an annoyance, is that the app doesn’t stop playing a show or movie when the TV is turned off. So when the TV is turned on later the show/movie is still playing I’ve lost my spot."
2020-07-16 18:40:52,Account,3,lovelysweetflower❤️🌸🌷,False,I was expecting the app to be like the CW were it didn’t matter if you had a account. But I was surprised to see the you have to have one to watch shows and that kinda of ticked me off. I know you have to make money some how but couldn’t you just have like 30 seconds of adds every so often?
2020-08-27 02:18:40,Used to love it...,1,Jesanyc,False,"HBO needs to step up their game, and make this available in all viewing platforms. It was great before the change to HBO Max... had no problems  with it before. Loved it actually, but since they rebranded and changed things up it became unavailable for me to stream. I am still paying for a subscription and now I can’t even watch it on my device.... Booo HBO!

You should have secured your streaming availability before rolling the rebrand out."
2020-07-20 17:09:40,Disappointed ☹️,1,Camiry,False,"I loved the whole idea of HBOMAX, but I MISS HBO GO.  HBO GO didn’t hassle me or prevent me from watching due to cellular streaming.  HBO MAX freezes fREQUENTLY and prevents me from enjoying movies, series, documentaries, etc.  it’s now July 15 and HBO MAX made its debut May 27 with ample time to resolve bug and kinks in the app....hurry, I’m losing faith.  I deleted the app and downloaded the app again like many of us would yet the same result.  WarnerMedia and it’s developers created an app that isn’t so friendly to users..."
2020-09-16 13:48:09,"Good Content, Bad App",3,AndyFromSandy,False,"You can download content to watch later, but if you don’t have internet access, the app won’t open. This means if you’re flying on a plane, in the mountains camping, etc. you can’t watch the content you downloaded. The app will not open without service. Please fix. This is on both iPhone and iPad."
2020-06-21 00:30:22,This is a mess,1,Robbed!!!!!!,False,I pay for hbo go and it won’t let me use it on my iPhone or any apple devices and my PS4. So I’m basically throwing money out the window. I can’t access any content and I keep getting a message that hbomax is unavailable and to use hbo now. So I try that and it just redirects me to hbo max. Fix this problem. I would like to be reimbursed for all this tome it’s been unavailable. I’ve been waiting on this issue to be corrected for a while now.
2020-06-15 06:14:42,Can’t view anything w/o interruptions,1,Nicker5774,False,"It’s been ten days of attempting to watch original content and movies without getting errors that the video could not be played. Not one time, have I been able to watch any length show from beginning to end and not be kicked out with an error message. It’s terrible. It doesn’t matter which device I use from my iPhone to iPad and there’s no app on the Apple TV. I’ll be cancelling my subscription ASAP."
2020-06-10 13:42:03,Bad service,2,@ndeland,False,"1 star because you had 3 different apps that all did the same thing. Confusing as hell to remember which one to use. Then 1 star because you went and combine them all, but now streaming services don’t work for AT&T customers (yet). So this app is completely useless until you get all your ducks in a row and I’m paying for streaming that I can’t access. Great job"
2020-06-01 15:26:42,Portrait vs. landscape,4,LilGoity,False,Can we get an update so the app lets you do both portrait and landscape.?  Currently you can only operate in landscape when you rotate an iPad on the launch or search screens  and potrait only on an iPhone for the initial launch.  Can we get both options on all devices....?????
2020-05-27 16:47:54,"Classics, new classics, anime and hbo originals",5,dogi smeeth,False,"Excellent.
The app works well and doesn’t look like all the others.  Surprised how much content available that I hadn’t seen in a while from the vault.
If they can produce new content as excellent as band of brothers, Silicon Valley , game of thrones, sector five I’ll be happy."
2020-10-01 19:47:15,Having sign in issues,1,nickisticks10,False,Where do I sign in with cell phone provider. It states that you can select TV provider or mobile service provider but when the button is clicked it only takes you to the TV providers I cannot login with my credentials. This came free with AT&T cell phone service the only reason I’m trying to use or even sign in and I can’t even use it. Not troubleshooting or wasting my time. Deleting app
2020-09-07 21:56:19,"Awful, terrible",1,Suspicous T1!,False,The app won’t load onto my iPad even though I’m running OS 13.2 when 12.2 or later is required. Also it won’t work on my roku TV. What’s the point of having a streaming service that only works on my phone? No wonder they are running a cut rate special for the year with such a cut rate product. This app was launched over 2 months ago. Will it start working before my subscription is up in another 12?
2020-06-27 07:20:08,To much buffering,3,Ovoeddie,False,"Just got HBO max today and I am streaming the app from my ps4 console and the movie just kept buffering never had a problem with any of my other streaming platforms; just needed to get that out there, if it’s just the fact that it’s on my console or because the way it streams in console is different from cellular or Pc."
2020-09-02 15:45:22,Well Designed and Streams as Expected,5,JayyGeyy,False,"App is well designed and runs smoothly, haven’t had any issues and at least for me doesn’t appear to be missing any features."
2020-08-22 00:24:17,I just wanted a trial...,5,Sqidog,False,"But then I watched infinity train season three and Lovecraft country and both shows are still being released... you’ve got me hbo max, I will pay for your content!!! Evil posting these wonderful shows!!!"
2020-07-30 01:06:01,Weird subscription,2,The century city mayor,False,We had hbo max through at&t and I was watching friends one day and then I took a break and came back after a bit and it said I needed my parent or guardian to unlock all access. So I talked to them and they said the subscription apparently ran out. But it hadn’t been a month yet and they said that at&t said they have the subscription but hbo says they don’t so idk
2020-10-12 00:53:12,Play/pause problem,3,Gurveer81,False,Anytime you switch out if the app or close it the play/pause feature disappears. It’s a very annoying problem and each time you need to navigate to the show and hit okay then pause. This didn’t used to be a problem but it is now.
2020-06-11 22:05:36,"No downloads, no auto play, no skip recap",1,GOV94,False,Won’t let me play any of my downloads while I’m offline. Kind of defeats the purpose of having it. Will also crash every time I try to stream from my phone to tv. There’s also no auto play for episodes so you have to get up and change it manually if you’re connected via hdmi cable with an adapter. No skip recaps. The app was great until you want to watch it anywhere else.
2020-06-04 23:48:32,Terrible.,1,AmberTriguero,False,"I received a subscription through my AT&T service. And it worked perfectly for about three days. I was really excited about being able to watch some of my favorite show. But now, all it tells me to do is re-link my subscription and every time I do it just reverts me back to the sign in page like a endless loop. SO DISAPPOINTED right now. I’ve tried to delete and redownload. I called at&t to see if they can help. I get nothing."
2020-05-29 14:21:31,Now it works,5,Cit1974,False,Originally gave 1 star since couldn’t connect w att/directv issues - those were resolved and able to get access today - thanks for quick updates
2020-05-27 22:22:57,"So far, so good…",5,Bashful30319,False,"Today, on day one, the apps seem pretty stable. There’s, as advertised, too much counter to browse in one sitting. The hubs are like Disney’s and keep you focused. Can’t wait for additional features when they’ve acclimated to volumes."
2020-09-28 21:55:20,Chromecast with HBO Max,3,Musiclver05,False,User interface could be easier to work with but I’ve been using HBO Max and chromecast since the new app started but since I’ve updated to iOS 14 the chromecast symbol is gone. I went to the other apps to check and it still work fine. But HBO no longer offers the option to cast to my chromecast.
2020-10-01 13:20:10,Keep having to restart app,2,sje127,False,Love everything on here...when I can get the app to even load up. I’m on the most recent version of iOS and the app on this device and sometimes restarting the iPad will help but there are days I can’t even get through a single episode of a show. It’s not my internet because I don’t experience this with other services.
2020-08-02 20:53:15,Everything was perfect until...,3,ssolsnchz,False,"Everything looks perfect. The content is  impressive, but I was really disappointed when I realized that there are no other language options other than English.  There is not even the option of subtitles in different languages."
2020-09-25 23:17:24,Eh.,4,.my honest opinion..,False,"There are plenty of options on what to watch, bunt on anime like hunter x hunter, you can’t even change the language to the original Japanese! Otherwise, it’s great. Please add an option to the anime series to be able to change the language to the original Japanese."
2020-09-24 00:31:50,Bring back hbo go,1,stupid cant use my name,True,"Possibly one of the worst apps ever. I have a very fast internet connection althoug ALTHOUGH each and Every time I try to watch using this app it stops many times and then won’t load at all. Why am I paying if it doesn’t work. Love the showtime app, it NEVER craps out like this one. Too bad because I really like the shows. Oh well, better I save my money. Also even after downloading content it still won’t play."
2020-07-04 15:49:29,Chrome cast??,3,Beck754,False,"The app has good content and I can watch it on my phone and newest Samsung tv, but It doesn’t give me an option to cast to anything from my phone. The button appeared when I first downloaded the app but it has disappeared since then. Without the button, hbo Max is useless for all the rest of my devices."
2020-07-23 05:25:12,I guess it’s fine,5,Jaipurking,False,"I like skipping a lot so it is annoying that the skip button is not available. Also, they don’t have a lot of movies. But I don’t really care cause I don’t use it that much"
2020-07-11 23:49:23,It’s doing much better now.,4,1800jomama,False,I like the app. It use to have glitches that would slow or make the video repeat apart it was very annoying. However it started doing that less and then stopped. I watch movies and cast to my tv all the time. 🔥
2020-06-13 04:45:30,Update no longer shows free streams,2,13Kidsnixon,False,Started watching Veep on the hbo now app and today I open the app and a notification tells me to update because this version is no longer available. I update and open the app then I find Veep I click on Veep and it tells me to subscribe. I’m already subscribed to other streaming services so I’ll have to pass on hbo for now but maybe subscribe later.
2020-10-06 13:43:23,Playback controls disappear,2,Burlinea,False,"Loving the content but I’m having issues with the app. When I use Chromecast to cast to the TV, the playback controls disappear, even after clicking the Chromecast widget. Since I can’t pause or rewind once a show starts, I end up watching from my phone, which is a terrible experience, especially for the price of the service."
2020-05-29 23:16:32,My account with the computer and the phone don’t sync,4,meglo99,False,"Got me really frustrated — just checking out my first TV show on HBO max. Wanna switch it up to watch it on my phone, then I realized I couldn’t find the watch history on my phone cuz they don’t sync from the computer! WHY"
2020-07-03 19:32:02,It’s good but...,3,Daryele,False,It’s a good app and I like how you can just switch with just updating the app. But whenever I try to watch it on my phone it says my wifi needs to be connected and it already is and it still doesn’t let me watch it. All in all the app is okay for its shows and movies but it isn’t all that.
2020-10-06 00:23:44,Good Stuff to watch but how? App is terrible,1,-=Anubus=-,True,"We’ve been struggling to figure out how to watch this on our brand new top of the line LG OLED TV with the latest Web OS. All other streaming services are available but HBO? Nada. Well, you say, how about Airplay from our Apple devices...nope. Doesn’t work. Used to but after their latest update now that’s broken too. Hard to figure why we would continue 15 bucks a mont for something we can’t watch."
2020-10-05 16:34:18,Horrible,1,BN642,False,"This app isn’t bad, it’s downright awful. Doesn’t keep my TV provider login information stored, and despite the fact that I can download shows, when I’m on an airplane watching them, the app says it’s not connected to the internet and then gives me a consistent error when I try to restart after it crashes. Absolutely horrible execution on this. Thanks for going away from HBO Go and giving us this hot grabage."
2020-09-21 15:12:17,Streams well,4,crissie3p0,False,So. Far since deciding to buy this app I have been pleasantly happy. We got the app before the Max roll out. My only complaint is that while using the app via Roku tv it does not allow me to watch the Max originals which was the purpose of getting the app.
2020-09-13 15:15:48,Can’t even use the program,1,HRM Reviewer,False,"Still on Comcast until I fully quit shortly, so for now I would need to log in via Xfinity. But nope. I can’t log in directly on TV (Samsung) and I can’t get the app to get to log in screen on phone. It hangs up on choosing provider then after 4-5 minutes if the list populates and never goes past my choice of provider. 

So, I want to login and watch but there’s no way to do it. That’s pretty awful."
2020-09-10 18:36:07,No longer usable through Xfinity,1,Dianaaaaaaaäaaaaaaaaaa,False,"After a great summer of streaming all sorts of movies and shows, the app is no longer usable. I keep receiving the error that I’m trying to log in using a “secondary Xfinity ID.” This was never a problem before and from what I’ve read online, it is a problem for many now. From my research, it looks like even if you log in with the primary ID, it still gives you this error."
2020-09-07 22:04:10,Can’t watch a show with out it stopping,2,abby_95,False,I have HBO max and there is not a day that it doesn’t happen I’m sick and tired of it I’m trying to get back on after it log me out and tried to send a reset password even though I have a touch screen  password and no email has been sent and now I have to call the bank to cancel the auto pay !
2020-08-17 17:34:22,HBO = Great Content; This App = Terrible Coding,2,jeffsolomon,False,"Huh? 

So I download content for offline listening. I go camping. I’m, well, offline. I pop open HBO Max iOS and am ready to watch my previously downloaded content, and whoa, wait, HBO Max fails to open because it can’t connect the the internet. WTH. Nope. Can’t use at all. Just keeps trying to connect and won’t load past slash screen. 

No offline watching for me. Bad bad bad."
2020-07-21 02:03:13,You never fixed my 2 new phone purchase problem,1,Steven KSH,False,"-1- Your insurance shipped the phone to the wrong address and blamed it on Fed-X 
I canceled the insurance on all 3 phones 

-2- you sent me the small version of the 
I-10. 

Stiffed me with I-10 XS Instead of I-10 XS MAX 
No matter how many times I tried to explain  the problem , even though I called you the day I received the new phone 
You sent me the wrong size and now I am stock with it 

You guys used to be much more customer oriented, your agents are very nice but they couldn’t help me 

This is the first time I ever had a problem with AT&T , I was never verbally told about the 14 days buyer’s rule 

I am going to be stock with $1,100 tiny phone for a long time to come 

So sad to bad for me"
2020-07-03 22:55:01,HBO max review,4,lucaschannel07,False,This is a nice app filled with all your great shows and cartoon networks and original. My problem is I think you should have a skip intro button for the shows. It feels wonky having to do it manually all the time just to see the episodes
2020-05-30 18:46:40,HBO max could be better,3,a.j.perez,False,The app has some good content that I’ve enjoyed. My only problem is that the video connection is constantly interrupted which is very annoying and I have to watch everything  while it stops very 30 seconds. The app could definitely use some big fixes!
2020-06-16 17:30:09,Poor download option,2,Linseed88,False,Using downloads to either save bandwidth or for use in poor signal area is a pain. Always try’s to run off stream. Even if you play from download screen still try’s to screen then stops to buffer. Need to turn off internet then start movie/ show and then turn internet back on to play download. Can be very dis functional.
2020-06-03 20:29:33,AT&T user,4,WolfEra2911,True,"Edit: I changed this from a one star to a 4 star since it is now working!! Wish they had more of a variety to watch though!

Claims AT&T wireless users have this service but when I log in it says we don’t.. Customer Service can’t help either..."
2020-10-04 01:43:04,Literally refuses to use chromecast,2,slimegetpack,False,"You can connect to the chromecast just fine, but for whatever reason, no matter the device you’re on, it just stops playing the video the moment you connect. So if you like looking at a purple screen, this is truly your app.

The shows are great and the app/website is ok though, so it’s fine overall I guess"
2020-05-28 15:09:10,Does not recognize iTunes credentials,1,PrideOfTheFox,False,"To be sure, it is not clear if this is an Apple or HBO problem.  I have an HBO subscription via Apple.  both Apple and HBO indicate that this subscription will have access to HBO Max content.  When trying to log in though to the HBO Max app, I constantly get a “Can’t verify your subscription” error message.  It seems like others are having the same issue.  Would love to hear from somebody from HBO on how to solve for this."
2020-05-27 13:33:03,FRIENDS!,5,Rachel Greenb,False,"They have friends in the US! Although I hate paying for subscriptions, HBO max has friends, and besides buying the dvds or using a vpn for Netflix, this is the only way to get friends that has worked for me. Thank you so much!"
2020-10-19 03:43:59,Can’t actually watch anything,1,willturner19,False,"Despite having constant access to the internet I cannot actually watch anything on the HBOMax app while using my laptop. Using the same account I can watch shows on my computer, but as soon as I try on my iPad it says that I am not connected to the internet, which I obviously am as I typically close out of the app and begin streaming shows with no issues on Netflix."
2020-10-17 21:56:15,Disappointed,1,AC1099,False,App/service in general is terrible across all platforms. With such a large library of content there needs to be better filter options when searching for movies and shows. Given that their library spans decades maybe have the ability to filter or sort by year or decade? Very disappointed that it feels like little effort went into the actual application.
2020-09-04 23:57:21,Fix your downloads,2,JD173747,False,"You cannot switch apps when downloading shows. If you do, you have to restart the download. Additionally it pauses the download if the lock screen comes on, so the only way to download is to spend a half hour sitting with the phone touching the screen the whole time. 

The rest is functional at least"
2020-09-04 15:00:36,Not service in all countries,1,usuerioxd,False,"Hi, I am from South America and I really want to try this service of streaming because there is a show in danger called Infinity train and i loved this show from CN, but there are rumors that this show will be cancelled, so I want to give the support to the cartoon. 
But what do you expect about views if a lot of people CANT WATCH HBO MAX.
So please, launch HBO MAX in the rest of the countries and please dont cancel Infinity Train there are a lot of people giving support in social networks."
2020-07-13 22:44:28,Frustrated,3,stickersteve,False,I am trying to rewatch some of my favorite okd series but when i go back later to watch another episode it does not start from where i left off. I just started season three of the wire. Went back to watch the next episode later in the day and it went right to season four.
2020-07-12 18:26:59,Great titles,3,Diva504,False,"The only drawback with having such a vast collection of movies to choose from is that there is no feature available to save movies to watch later. You have to watch the movie you want as soon as you see it, and it’s too many others to choose from and remember."
2020-06-24 17:50:03,I don't like the free features,3,SNSD <3,False,"I'm enjoying the shows on HBO. However, it tends to put me in the wrong episode I was previously watching. Also, when I have to search for the right episode, the app does not give me a skip button. I have to physically search for the show again to corw the list of episodes."
2020-07-12 03:27:47,Dc all around,5,WsopDav,False,"This is definitely for dc fans, it has all the dc movies and shows, it obviously has more but the Snyder cut coming for justice league and possibly more, this will if successful be the Disney plus of dc instead of marvel, very cool and hope this project progresses"
2020-06-11 05:46:44,Downloads don’t play,3,CycleSmiths,False,I love the content and download several episodes and movie to watch when I don’t have WiFi. Unfortunately playback is sporadic at best and often I can’t even get the app to open without an internet connection. That makes the download option a bit pointless.
2020-06-04 13:41:17,Hey HBO Max I pre-purchased a year via website at reduced price...,3,EclipseGP1233,True,"Can you please hurry up and get Roku support. It’s hard to watch on an iPhone when your tv is a Roku. It is 2020, I find it hard to believe that a media company like WarnerMedia would leave money on the table by not having all platforms available at launch. Forget about haggling over revenue at the moment and get Roku already. 
In our house it is only one TV with an Apple TV box is in the basement of the house. Out of five TV’s the remaining are all Roku. 

Content: 4/5 (Doctor Who 1-11, Teen Titans, etc)
App: 3/5 (interface is okay) 
Accessibility (availability): 2.5/5 
Final Score: 3/5"
2020-06-08 23:04:51,Selection of movies and shows are great.,4,Pito242,False,The titles they offer are great but the mobile app when you stream through Chromecast isn’t HD. Everything is coming out in a 480p signal and it is not nice to look at. This needs fixing ASAP. And 4K HDR is a must chop chop HBO you guys have plenty money don’t skimp is out
2020-06-08 06:18:16,New Support Only,1,FreeTimeJoy&Fun,False,"They're not supporting a lot of Apple devices people use that can't get iOS 12. They have a lot of customers who use these devices. AT&T isn't thinking too well again lol. I'm also giving it 1 star because it doesn't work well on an iPhone 7+, which has the latest iOS version on it. There's always different problems with the app. I'm unable to watch anything, most of the time."
2020-09-08 09:36:20,HBO’s targeted audience leaves out all non-English speaking ethnicities.,3,1facade1,False,Subtitles don’t work and there is a poor choice in subtitle translation options like Spanish. Wouldn’t pay for this just on the language options alone if it wasn’t already free from my cable provider. Otherwise great selection. However please modernize.
2020-10-19 02:40:10,It was all good until a week ago,1,nettethebest,False,I use to absolutely love this app! I would literally use the hbo max app everyday UNTIL it stop casting to my television. I thought I was having a problem myself until i went to my moms house and she was having he same issue! After Love Craft Country season finale i will be deleting the app until love craft country comes back on and i will delete again once it goes back off!
2020-07-12 09:28:23,Won’t data stream,3,anonreed,False,"The app is nice but there’s some sort of bug that won’t let you watch anything using cellular data. I changed the setting to allow data streaming, rebooted the app, made sure it was turned on for all profiles. Kind of defeats the purpose if I can only watch at home."
2020-08-21 00:19:56,I LOVE THE APP BUT.........,5,Amani Graham,False,I love Hbo Max I binge watch everything!! My only problem is it is not supported by Roku I just brought a Roku even though I have cable because I was tired of having to use my Xbox to stream it. But.. UNFORTUNATELY Roku does not have Hbo Max this is a HUGEEE problem that they need to add!! PLEASE ADD Hbo Max to Roku!!
2020-08-10 18:00:06,HBO GO WAS BETTER,2,crpple,False,"It’s really frustrating that you’ve killed off HBO GO .. all of my data from that app — my list, watched shows, etc., didn’t transfer to HBO MAX — Now it’s a PITA to find HBO specific stuff because HBO MAX is watered down with JUNK SHOWS!  Friends? Really? OMG!  HBO MAX is equally crappy on iOS & on Apple TV. 
I suggest adding the option to view HBO ONLY content. And you should’ve had the foresight to transfer lists etc. from HBO GO!"
2020-08-08 01:23:29,Horrible streaming experience,2,DPR129,False,"I love the content on this app, but hardly watch it because the streaming is constantly interrupted and the app fails.  It’s annoying, and I can’t get through one episode of a tv show without it shutting down.  I use chromecast for many other streaming services and I never have a problem.  Not pleased and most likely cancelling."
2020-07-27 00:42:39,Apple TV version has major lip sync issues,1,iPhone/Kindle User,False,"When I watch any show (e.g. Perry Mason) there is terrible lip sync issues on our Apple TV 4K with Denon 1500 AVR and LG OLED.  I have no issues with Netflix, Disney+, or AT&T TV Now app playing HBO content.  It “only” happens with HBOMax.  I’m assuming developers are not experienced with streaming protocols and aren’t taking advantage of lip sync technologies.  Also, still can’t believe there is no 4K, Dolby Vision, or Atmos.  Feels so dated and broken.  Content producers should look elsewhere..."
2020-07-20 02:38:42,"Good options, atrocious execution",1,Portojohny,False,"I will never for the life of me understand why you would have a download option on shows if you are still going to require a consistent internet connection. Completely defeats the purpose of downloading if it still has to buffer ever couple minutes and kicks me out of my show 3 times. Take away the internet requirement for downloaded shows, seriously."
2020-07-15 07:52:25,Piece of garbage,1,cfonte1,True,I have hbo max included in my ATT elite plan. It used to login fine. Now it logs in and has my name as the viewer for a split second and then jumps back to the login screen and makes me do it again. This repeats over and over. Really?  What’s the point of offering this stuff if it doesn’t work. Weeks have gone by and this still doesn’t work. I’m about ready to dump ATT and bring my $250 plus a month business to somebody else.
2020-06-08 00:26:34,Offline Mode needs Internet,2,Review 20000,False,"When you download a show to watch later when you won’t have internet, the app won’t load. You have have internet to get your downloaded show to start. Once started, you can lose internet, but if you change apps for a Second, you have to get internet again to start it."
2020-07-06 23:01:44,Where’s Trutv section,5,where is the trutv section,False,It’s good but where the hell is the other sections like where’s the trutv section I want to see hardcore pawn and south beach tow where is it hbo max but anyways it’s a wonderful streaming experience i highly recommend it for fans of all of hbo
2020-06-10 02:51:21,Can I get a Skip Intro Please!!!!,4,Shog1890,False,"The app is fairly decent across all platforms, I myself, have not had any issues. It did take me a second to navigate fluently but in the end it’s basically the same as, HBO Now, with minor changes in the selections.

Two words: Skip Intro."
2020-05-27 18:09:41,Nice 👍,3,johnls1981,False,"For the most part I love the new HBO MAX update,However I don’t like that my HBO NOW Watch List didn’t convert over so now I have to find all the movies and series again and re add them .smh!!! 🤦‍♂️ Great thing is they added things you can’t watch anywhere else so I’m very happy about that. I’m sure I’ll come back with a 5 star ⭐️ rate soon."
2020-05-28 03:04:37,Been waiting for HBO Max and worth it,5,rmaxey21,False,"I LOVED HBO Now, but HBO Max takes it to a whole new level. Love the new interface. I love the new titles and the familiar ones. I’m a Game of Thrones addict but also love a plethora of other titles and genres and HBO Max is where it’s at. Worth every penny. 10/10 ❤️🙌🏼"
2020-05-28 00:25:57,Great app not so great search,4,Brayden001,False,"The app and content are wonderful. This definitely seems like the long waited update to the HBO viewing experience. However, a lack of voice search in the Apple TV app makes finding specific shows kinda hard."
2020-06-11 18:53:44,Downloads require internet to play?,2,Me657483,False,"I downloaded a movie for some travel, and  get ~30 minutes into before it says it is having trouble playing the video and to check my internet connection.  Why have download options just to then arbitrarily require internet to the play downloaded content?"
2020-05-27 17:02:56,Don’t listen to the 👎 reviews!,4,BiLlY tHe BoOdEr XD,False,This app is awesome don’t listen to bad reviews listen to good reviews like this one! This app is one of the best apps ever I’m soo glad that I subscribed to this cause it’s worth it! Really it’s worth the money. Kinda well there are some bugs but they are really not that annoying🤷🏾‍♂️
2020-10-08 05:26:48,Love the content but can’t abide the UI,1,nw_vandal,False,"Can’t turn off auto play so the next episode always starts unless you manually stop it. Not a huge issue until you try to select an earlier episode or skip ahead an episode and the option to do so is seemingly not available. As great as the content is, the UI is so bad I don’t think I’ll keep the subscription through the trial period, much less beyond."
2020-09-08 18:41:58,Great app but i want this movie to be added please,5,KICKIN BUDY,False,"So I’ve been watching the Teen Titans and i was wondering if the Teen Titans trouble in Tokyo movie could be added. Besides that idea of addition, the app has been really good. Amazing content."
2020-08-05 04:46:28,"good content, terrible app",1,Sooriginl,False,"The regular HBO app worked great but they decided to apparently switch to a whole new backend platform for hbo+ app.  A bit slower and wonky to navigate.   The screen casting is very glitchy...if your internet connection stumbles for a few seconds the app will lock up itself, my ipad, and my new vizio smartcast tv. some blame goes to apple for my new ipad having weak unstable wifi connections compared to my 20 other devices"
2020-06-16 02:31:44,Have any HBO staff ever seen Netflix,1,Kliikstur,False,"Clunky interface. Can’t skip repetitive show intro’s. If watching episode 1 can’t click forward to episode 2. Can’t jump forward during viewing. Always an ad for one of their shows. Main screen is clumsy, hard to find what you want to watch. I could go on and on. I am not that picky but compared to what has been out for years, this is bad. HBOMAX is a 1920 Ford and Netflix is a 2020 Tesla."
2020-06-09 08:28:33,Cant wait for the update!!,2,Hermes the messenger,False,"Love the content but the media player could use some real loving; for example
Theres no menu or option to tap to view other episodes or seasons.
Theres no way to see other episodes on continue watching on the app with out going to search. 
Theres no simple forward or rewinding by double tapping the sides"
2020-05-31 02:55:47,An “Okay” App.,4,SSivar503,False,"Everything is okay about the app. There are problems like phone battery power drains out really fast, bugs at Series/ Movies Descriptions text and others. Plus Device Compatibility being really bad right now. But Entertainment wise it’s really good.."
2020-06-05 05:13:36,Please fix Parental Controls ASAP,1,EBDutch,False,The way parental controls works in the new app is really awful. You are basically in a do loop where you think you can update things via Manage Profiles - wrong!  Then when you try and play something that is blocked you are asked to change your parental controls PIN number which does nothing. Please look at how Netflix has implemented parental controls and switch to that.
2020-06-05 03:12:05,Can’t log in,1,Kkitty113,True,"Says my iPhone 8 isn’t supported, so why would it force download this app?? I can’t watch anything. 
Garbage company. I want my money back now.  

In response to the developer: my iPhone is updated to the newest version. I did several troubleshooting steps to try to figure this out and checking for an iOS update was literally the first thing I did. I got my money back so I don’t even care anymore.  Crap service."
2020-06-04 02:37:59,This app is so frustrating,1,Feisfun,False,"Soo frustrating- the app can’t pick up where you left off and content that is “downloaded” isn’t. 
When downloaded items don’t play due to poor connection it kind of defeats the purpose of the download! It says the show is downloaded but won’t play without using data or WiFi. Don’t think I’ll keep this app unless that gets fixed soon! 

This app is so frustrating"
2020-06-01 20:25:03,What’s the point of this?,1,Olive pairs 419,False,"Yet again, the app industry is colluding with the cell phone industry to push out useless new versions that just increase storage size and force people to upgrade their phones for more $$$. 

HBO NOW was completely fine. Why fix something if it’s not broken??? Are they that desperate to attract more clients with a purple logo instead of a black logo?

And of course the functionality is  substantially reduced. Great job HBO. What’s next ?"
2020-05-27 22:30:30,"Great Launch, but....",4,theeVitaminBe,False,"When I saw this new offering from HBO I was excited. They are the KING of Original content. Love the selection; finally I can stream Fresh Prince Lol! 

I use the platform via Chromecast and my IPhone X. The audio levels are soooo low. Even when adjusting the volume on the YV it’s still super low"
2020-05-28 21:17:14,New App Not Supported On Iphone,1,Dougypup,False,I was literally in the middle of a movie and had to pause. When I came back it had updated automatically to the HBO Max app (instead of HBO Now) and it wouldn’t work on my phone because it’s unsupported! So now I can’t even use my HBO now subscription on my own iPhone! This is ridiculous and terrible. We pay money for this service. Make it so that everyone can access their account on their phone.
2020-05-28 18:12:23,Can no longer watch on my phone!,1,kelslittle,False,HBO Max did not make it clear that i would not be able to log in to the app with my HBO Now subscription. I do not have a working laptop and now I am paying $15 a month to not be able to access content on either my phone or my Roku. This inconvenience makes me not want to switch over to HBO Max because it doesn’t make any sense why my HBO Now account wouldn’t just transfer.
2020-05-27 18:45:08,Frustrating,1,Bitch01590,False,Am I the only one currently having connection issues? I’ve already updated but it’s still not fixed. Also while I was watching a show a message popped up that may phone carrier might charge me extra to use HBO max. What the hell. I am already being charged to have the subscription and I can’t use it on my tv because the app isn’t available on Roku. Can somebody fix this please.
2020-05-27 16:32:04,What a Joke,1,Radiorose96,False,Really HBO!  Really upset that we can’t watch hbo max on Roku. That’s the whole reason we bought it in first place. I don’t see how that’s even a thing. I’m paying for max and that’s what I expect to get.  Mostly bought it for the lord of the rings and Harry Potter . Can’t watch either.  Better get with Roku and get an update. Won’t wait long either.  Feels like we r always getting screwed one way or another. SO TIRED! Please fix this soon.
2020-07-24 21:22:08,Content,3,Your nameistaken,False,"I watch many shows on HBO and MAX, but I don’t like the one-sided political shows that are on HBO.  If I use this app, am I always going to see political hacks masquerading as entertainment?  I hope not.  As it is now, I just change  the programs.  I’m not a whiz kid with high tech so I shall see if the selection of streaming can compete with my fingers.🤓"
2020-10-06 03:42:45,Glitchy glitchy glitchy,1,HStitt,False,"The new update has made my app insanely glitchy. Video starts and stops at least 20-30 times, every couple minutes. The caption button closes out the video. It keeps disconnecting me on Chromecast. I can’t fast forward or rewind without the video pausing for a couple minutes, or skipping way too far ahead. I’ll skip to 2:00 and it displays 30 seconds. Just a hot mess."
2020-10-02 02:21:49,Get over your issues with Roku.,1,Sunshine9194,False,"I was so excited to see friends on the hbo Max app that I hopped right on subscribing. Only to find out you and Roku can’t come to an agreement so they can access the app. I don’t feel that I should drop a crap ton of money just to be able to use your app on an actual tv. Until you all can get that situated for the 100s of 1000s of Roku users, I’m not recommending it be downloaded or subscribed to!"
2020-09-27 03:27:34,Parental controls,1,hbomaxfrustration,False,"I have had the app for one day and I’m so frustrated I’m already about to unsubscribe. I can not for the life of me figure out how to change parental controls. It won’t let me even watch shows like the Big Bang theory. And when I messaged hbo max about instructions and hey never got back to me. Several of my favorite shows are on here, but if this isn’t fixed very soon I am unsubscribing. Not impressed at all"
2020-09-14 11:07:54,Stoped working,2,Raise your own zombi,False,The app stoped working on my phone. It now goes to the download offline screen and tells me I'm not connected to the Internet when i am and all my other apps and web browser work just fine. Also i wish there was more content i really love lovecraft country and doom patrol but wish more content like that was available.
2020-08-14 11:36:26,Connection Errors All the time,2,Maldog37,False,"Good selection, but some days the app simply won’t connect.  I can stream DTV just fine, but this app gives me consistent connection error messages and fails to connect and I can’t watch anything. Please auto reply with the canned answer that you appreciate my feedback and give me a worthless website to go to. Thanks"
2020-07-24 18:10:45,Voice search?!,2,Squeakums,False,How is it possible that the search on this new app doesn’t let you use Siri/voice search for the Apple TV option? I have to scroll through letters and it won’t even cause the Apple keyboard app to pop up on my phone to make the process easier. The old app had this so why are these features missing now??
2020-07-13 01:17:17,Bad parental controls,2,enberg1414,False,You can set parent controls based on who is watching but once they’re set they can never change. I wanted to change the settings to allow TV PG so kiddos can watch loony tunes but the changes never stick. Additionally if I switch the profile to an adult I’m stuck with the same choices as the kids. This really limits HBO’s library for adults.
2020-06-23 01:20:00,Poor Application,1,Starsmyle,False,This app is so frustrating. We spend 30 minutes just trying to get it to work (always stuck in buffering) every single time we try watching an episode. So for every hour episode we spend 30 minutes trying to get it to just stream. Reading reviews clearly an ongoing issue they have no intentions of fixing. Cancelling subscription after this month.
2020-06-16 14:38:42,Unreliable & no 4K,1,Dude Its Rob,True,"The app functions on 1 of 3 devices I’ve installed it on. So far, I’ve had sound issues on my smart TV. On the PS4 video playback stops after one episode of and you have to close the application and restart it to watch anything else. So far it has worked on my iPhone but I haven’t watched more than a minutes  worth of content on my phone so I had to give it another star by default."
2020-06-08 14:08:46,Annoyed with HBO MAX,1,Miss Period Perfect,False,This new app is garbage to say the least. I have been a loyal customer of HBO Now for 8 years and never really had any issues with the app on my Apple devices or Samsung TVs until now. This app has missing content that was promised and the content that is readily accessible will not load properly. How do you get sound but no picture? There’s nothing wrong with my internet connection and a Mbps is top of the line.
2020-05-28 18:36:01,Udderly Ridiculous,1,Cinnamonstring,False,I am giving this a one star review. Because of you having to delete your account to get rid of your credit card information. That was saved on your account. It is ridiculous because I have subscribed to things that allow me to do the one payment for one month. And then get rid of my saved information. But besides that the staff I had called were cool and nice.
2020-09-06 11:47:03,"Buffering, Buffering, Buffering",2,Tryllion,False,"No other streaming service struggles so much!  We were so excited for all the content on HBO Max but now I am not sure it is worth it... If the buffering and slow streaming isn’t resolved I doubt we will continue to use

Also, whatever the issue with Roku is, get it resolved... it is stupid I have to go through the PS4 to watch!"
2020-08-09 21:40:32,"Good service, still need to fix 5.1",4,Dance Diva 5567,False,"All right since mid July, still no 5.1 surround fix for Chromecast. Was hoping they’d finally fix it and last weeks update. Apparently not. Come on HBO. Honestly 5.1 Audio is pretty much a standard get with the program"
2020-08-07 19:21:42,"Great content, but...",2,Layne345578,False,"Of course HBO has great content but it seems that HBO put very little effort into making a well-rounded video app. Also, they didn’t even have the app (the MAX version) ready to roll on all popular formats (Roku doesn’t even have the Max version available so I paid for for this app and I can’t even access what I was watching on my tablet on my tv)."
2020-08-05 21:18:28,"Way behind the competition, fix the navigation and ui",2,TM_1490,False,"A frustrating user experience just to do the basics of navigating multiple episodes / seasons. Watching an episode but want to select a different one in the series? No direct way to do so - instead you have to exit out, search for the show, and navigate to the episode."
2020-08-03 18:16:20,Removed old app but this ain’t working,1,SodaDave,False,"After an hour of updates and googling I have come to the conclusion that for some reason they removed the old App and directed me to download this instead and then it won’t work with my subscription... If you no longer want me as a customer HBO just say so, don’t make me spend an hour telling me to download an app and then when I use it have it tell me it won’t work."
2020-08-02 01:48:36,DOES NOT WORK!,1,nunya72727272,False,"When trying to watch a show on my tv through my playstation, the shows get stuck on buffer and will not load! It makes trying to watch any series a very frustrating experience! Content is great but what is the point if it doesn’t work properly and you can’t watch it..... maybe you should call Netflix and ask them how to fix your streaming service!"
2020-06-22 08:24:40,Needs better navigation,3,I'm guuu,False,It’s ridiculous how hard it is to watch a show sometimes. I like the content but I feel like it needs to be smoothed out. Feels too thrown together hoping the good content keeps it floating. Please fix this HBO. It would make a lot of people happier. I know I’m not the only one. Thanks.
2020-06-28 23:58:57,Some Episodes of their TV series is not the original Language,4,RobertNeville2020,True,"Doctor Who Season 6, Episode 1 is I think in Italian but the rest of them is in English 😂 needs a lot to improve but I'm happy Friends are here.

Also, season 7 episode 9. Hope they fix it"
2020-06-21 21:12:33,Volume needs work!!,3,Nsm369,False,The app could be so much better if I didn’t have to keep turning the volume up and down throughout watching movies/shows. One minute it’s blaring so loud I can’t stand it and the next it’s so low I cannot hear it. Please fix this issue or I will be cancelling my subscription.
2020-05-28 06:03:40,Good But could use some fixes,3,Craven8,False,"It’s a great service with lots of choices, but a lot of the titles they had in their presentations are in fact not available yet. There needs to be more filters as well as user friendly controls and keyboard functionality for fast forwarding."
2020-06-18 23:59:56,Worst app for streaming ever!!!,1,Racerecks13,False,This has to be one of the worst streaming apps out there! First I have to unlock my phone just so the next episode of a series will play. The app crashes frequently therefore I’m unable to watch anything. Figured with all the money y’all have made over the years this would be a no brainer. I guess we’ll see if it will get better... May the odds forever be in your favor.
2020-05-29 18:13:08,One star for App Store review..,1,_andreas.c,False,"I’m really excited when I heard rumors about HBO Max. I even talked my friend how much HBO Max gonna make impact among streaming services, decided to get annual subscription in early May. On the second thought, app experience comes to my mind. So I wait and turn out I’m right about that. Billion dollar company decided to put website in app which is crappy. Dear AT&T or WarnerMedia if you can’t afford a decent native app join Apple TV like HBO did"
2020-06-09 12:28:28,Has potential but not quite there yet,3,DomShepherd,False,I love the selection of shows and movies at launch and I’m sure more original content is coming. It is however glitchy at times and I’m not getting audio from chromecast but works fine on phone and computer.
2020-05-27 22:20:21,Really liking it,4,tufo91,False,Ever since we lost hbo on fish I’ve been wanting to have it back and when I herd of this I knew I had to try it and I’m glad I did very nice selection of content to choose from and it’s just the beginning happy I preordered it before hand :)
2020-10-10 21:29:04,Now vs. Max,1,Onasan,False,"So I’ve been forced to upgrade from Now to Max without a choice. That would be fine if it wasn’t for the fact that I’m now not allowed to use Max at all, so now I get the privilege of paying for something I can’t even access. Not only does it seem that AT&T and it’s CEO look to want to turn HBO into the same drivel as everything else, but seem to be doing it in the most ham-fisted way possible."
2020-09-20 19:24:44,"Good Content, Bad app",2,~(0_0~) ZombieGhost,False,"The app experience leave much to be desired. There’s no HDR support. The app is buggy, I often get an “you’re offline” error at random while watching. Content will often be pixelated or poor quality seemingly at random (I am on a 5G internet connection) and I do not have the same streaming quality issues on other apps."
2020-07-24 07:05:26,App Doesn’t work,1,Wagscf,False,"When I went to the app recently I was somehow logged out and whenever I try to log back in it says “we are having issues connecting to hbo max right now. Please try again.” It has been days not just once or twice, and no matter how many times I try again it says nothing different. I pay for a service I can’t use on all my devices...It’s frustrating."
2020-07-22 20:07:57,Accessibility issues all over this app,1,Texas Albatross,False,"Accessibility does not seem to even be considered in this app. No menu, it does not work well with voiceover and audio description is not even a consideration. If Netflix and prime video can do it then why not HBO?
Visually impaired people watch streaming services all the time. Their money is just as good as any sided person but HBO does not seem to think that way. That is why we use other services."
2020-06-10 16:24:28,Love this app,5,Prncsnada,False,"Super clean, sign up was smooth with my account from ATT Now. User friendly app with reliable functionality on both my iPhone and Apple TV. Content is great, but hurry and bring us more. And... Friends!"
2020-09-19 02:41:18,Love the shows but the app is trash,3,fookanicknamebruh,False,Wondering why when I am in wifi watching a show I already downloaded a cellular data warning keeps popping up. It makes no sense. Also the app is awful at casting to smart tvs. The cellular data thing though is what’s really annoying
2020-06-03 04:58:56,Poorly constructed App,1,thecrumblr,False,Sometimes there is a lag with the sound and the picture which is annoying. Also if I’m paying for this app I don’t want to have ads when playing episodes. Also there should be a way to skip the intro. There are a lot of issues with this app and I will be cancelling my service after another month of improvements aren’t made.
2020-05-28 05:41:39,I Have a Question???,4,chinonation,False,because they have not put the option to change the language in the series or movies that would be very good for the application to work with the public that speaks other languages
2020-05-27 09:25:33,loving the overall execution of the app,5,redmarz,False,"love the new UI it’s somewhat similar to HBOnow but at the same time much better
no bugs so far and hopefully it stays that way but I’m loving the overall execution of the app"
2020-08-06 01:16:09,"Great content, but there is a problem",3,AngelaMEvans,False,"The only thing I really have a problem with is that you can’t turn off autoplay, so if I fell asleep, it will keep playing whatever show I was watching until I wake up the next morning, or until my device dies."
2020-06-27 11:44:36,No dubbed movies,3,at/z,False,There are a lot of popular English movies my family would like to watch like for example the Harry Potter movies and many other families. I would love to see that improvement so the app can be enjoyed by the whole family if they speak a different language .
2020-07-23 01:59:25,Total Rip Off if you plan to watch this on your Television.,1,Fparada2,False,"I got this service today through my phone while I was out, and it’s a decent streaming app. However, HBO Max isn’t available on Roku (only HBO Now is). So, I can’t watch this on my tv. I have access to HBO Now through the same subscription, but Now has about half the Content that Max has. Don’t bother getting this service until HBO decides to let us use our TVs."
2020-07-17 23:38:38,Why can’t we skip intros!?,2,Emay87,False,"I’m quarantining at home and binging Big Love again, so sick of sitting through the intro song. And why is it such a pain to skip ahead to another episode or go back to a previous episode? You have to search the show and select from the full list of episodes. Could be more user friendly. Meh."
2020-06-27 05:38:37,Great selection,4,T.A. Danzi,False,"I love the selection of TCM and Studio Ghibli films all in one place for the first time. One request I have is to replace the bright purple HBOMax screen at the end of every movie with a darker version. It’s jarring to see such a bright image after the dark credits of a film stop rolling. 

Thanks!"
2020-09-15 20:11:49,Title,3,kyrieisvool,False,"The mobile downloading is very broken. About one fourth of the time, instead of taking you to your downloads, it just takes you to a ‘cannot connect’ screen. And it’s like, “Okay what different between now and the last time I wasn’t connected.”"
2020-06-19 06:29:43,Disappointed.,1,hueusbgn,False,I used HBO Now for all my devices and suddenly the app has been completely updated and is no longer even available. A pop up also informed me that hbo max isn’t supported by my provider when I already had hbo now before-now I can’t even log in online. so now as a paying customer i can’t watch my shows- or anything that I’m paying for. Fix this!
2020-06-12 00:37:08,Lots of glitches,2,Kate683,False,"While streaming the picture freezes frequently. I have to stop & restart the program, which is very annoying. Tonight it froze again. After several tries, I got it to play, but there was no sound. I had to delete the app & reinstall it. I like the programming, but the app needs a lot of work."
2020-06-02 17:29:53,Can’t watch on my phone.,2,King Boom Boo,False,"My billing is through Roku. Since it switched over to “HBO Max,” this provider isn’t supported, so I can’t use HBO on my phone. I can’t even view my account details. What I can do to watch on my phone is cancel my subscription, wait the 13 days for it to expire, then re-subscribe to a supported provider. Until then, this app is pointless!"
2020-05-27 13:34:38,Great Selection,5,Guitarist man 98,False,The selection on HBO max is fantastic. Very impressed with the shows available. So far the app has been working without any crashes or major problems.
2020-10-04 00:26:36,Some movies and series won’t cast using good chrome cast,2,Lito7979,False,"First let me say I am enjoying being able to cast HBO and it’s fantastic series. However, as of lately I’ve been noticing some  content just won’t cast. I’ve reset the devices and phones. Deleted the app and reinstalled and  the problem still
Persist.  Any feed back would be greatly appreciated."
2020-09-29 14:36:18,Add it for Firestick,2,Sweetcheeks847,False,I love that HBO Max partnered with AT&T BUT please add it to the Firestick app selection!! It’s great that I can watch movies on my phone but in today’s world of COVID we are home more than ever and mirroring my phone to the TV every time I want to watch a show or movie is a bit much. PLEASE consider adding the app to more than just the few options you currently have.
2020-09-29 11:57:48,Does not ever consistently work,1,crystalirene92,False,"We’re always having to find an alternative to what we wanted to watch because this app won’t load shows we select. The only advice the app ever gives is to “check your internet connection”, which is obviously fine because all of the streaming apps we use because this one won’t function have zero issues."
2020-09-26 17:07:49,Turn up the Volume...,2,Jarhead1971,False,"I would like to see the volume turned up when watching a movie. HBO Max is the only app that when I watch a movie that I have to crank up the volume on my receiver to be able to hear the dialogue. Every other app such as Apple TV+, Showtime, CBS All Excess, and others doesn’t require me to turn the volume up. And where is Dolby Atmos?"
2020-09-26 13:43:36,What happened,4,hannah bostwick,False,"This app is amazing and I love the movies and shows. I don’t know if it’s me but every time I watch something it’s like it’s deleted like a show it just disappears the next day. But over all, it’s an amazing app really recommend it."
2020-08-01 05:16:35,Hire the Prime Video Developers,3,Rdp103,False,I don’t normally write reviews but the functionality of this app is pretty bad. Your content is too good for this. It’s like an old house where you have to walk through a bedroom to get to the kitchen or the backyard. Terrible design. Don’t make it so hard to watch the next episode.
2020-08-11 22:43:37,Where is HBO MAX???,1,raysa524,False,"Don’t get me wrong, I loved HBO. I say loved because my TV’s (even those with an Internet app, DO NOT want to open HBO Max on the TV!!?!??? I have been paying for a fathom app!!! For awhile I could use the HBO app instead (a downgrade) but now that has been deactivated too. How much patience are we suppose to have? You introduced a disaster and WE are paying for it. Doesn’t work on the TV internet, my Firestick, my channel guide, and there is NO APP!!!! Fix it!"
2020-08-06 22:10:38,Cheaters,1,Cameagle,False,"First off, service just ain’t worth the price point they’re asking for. Add to the fact that I still can’t watch it in my tv due to them not having a deal with Roku. Biggest issue though is that they had a problem charging my card, which was working fine. They told me to enter a new one, so I changed my card and now all of a sudden I lost my cheaper rate. Seems like a scam to me."
2020-08-03 15:39:09,Cellular data warning,1,jmsiener,False,"Can’t watch because I keep getting a notification about using cellular data. My wifi is on, it’s connected so why? Also, if I’m watching a program and I am on cellular data then guess what, maybe I want that bill? You rolled this out months ago and you couldn’t even have it working by the time you phased out HBOGO? 

Get it together because what you made is garbage."
2020-08-02 00:55:52,Constant buffering,2,Tigrrlily18,False,"Every time I stream this app on my tv, I cannot get through one program before it starts endlessly buffering. I eventually get a message that something went wrong and I need to restart the app. Then it happens again. Incredibly frustrating as none of my other streaming channels have this problem."
2020-07-22 11:16:45,I literally only ask of one thing and one thing only,3,Fr3ddysw@gb3@r,False,There is two dc animated movies that I think should be added to hbo max. The two movies are justice league dark and justice league dark: apokolips war. Literally just those two movies should be added and I’ll change it to a 5 star
2020-05-30 15:25:37,No tv streaming,3,Liz_0624,False,"I like the content of the app but no TV streaming is available, not even in a smart tv. There’s no app for Roku or a different source. I read that there’s an app for PS4 but what about the people doesn’t have that? So, my intention was to keep the subscription but until this is resolved I won’t subscribe."
2020-06-10 01:04:49,Audio needs adjusting,1,Wancket,False,"One thing about streaming services, the audio quality is terrible. Everyone knows about quiet voices and loud action. However this app is worse than most. I have to turn my surround sound system up 20db higher than Netflix or Disney+ just to hear the talking, once the action kicks in, I must turn it down 20db and then back up for talking. Please adjust your levels."
2020-06-01 19:00:13,kicked off for not having HBO max,1,~~~mike~~~,False,"Instead of creating a new app for existing HBO subscribers, the team has apparently decided to kick everyone who doesn’t have cable off of the mobile app— making it harder to watch the shows I’m paying for. Bad choice. If other services can manage to have different subscription levels in the same app, HBO should be able to do this too."
2020-05-31 21:20:03,Beautiful app,5,billythemenace,False,I haven’t actually signed up yet but just wanted to say how great it is you get to explore all the content they have before having to subscribe that’s really amazing to see.
2020-10-19 16:44:32,Meh,3,Sensii,False,"I miss HBO GO. Get that business agreement set up! For whatever reason (and I’ve tried several troubleshooting options), this app will not connect to my chromecast tv. It used to, but now it doesn’t. Plenty of other apps work fine. Content is good, just needs bugs fixed."
2020-05-29 21:11:23,The Lamest Interface ever,1,phoneboy2000,False,"Here we are, several years into established streaming services and this is the best you could come up with? Credits for movies and shows barely available and if you happen to be streaming a series, the screen fills with the App logo lest you forget that it’s the one you’re in... selections are difficult to find and continuous streaming is arbitrary. It is not intuitive or informational. Way to go WB👎"
2020-05-28 04:33:20,Just needs support for Roku then we gucci,4,mynamejef😝,False,"someone who’s a fan of studio ghibli, adult swim, cartoon network, and hbo content this is a great app.  i wanna give it 5 stars but the only way i can watch it is on my phone, macbook, and ipad, i just hope an agreement can hopefully be made soon."
2020-05-27 15:23:09,Unable to Enter One-Time Passcode,1,Que-Dential,False,"This app may be great...too bad I have not had a chance to experience it. Each time I’m prompted to link the HBO MAX account with my Directv Account I’m emailed a One-Time passcode. However, I’m not able to enter the passcode as the app refreshes when I return each time. I have received more than 10 passcodes. 

I feel confident saying this will be fixed in an future update however, this is a bad first impression."
2020-05-27 12:27:59,Awsome,5,Giomar6390GVR5C,False,Today was my first day so far is working super. Super impressed with the content please keep working hard as you guys did on this streaming platform so far looks on the right track.
2020-10-20 08:45:41,Airplay is broken,2,PapabearWL,False,I dont know if it’s the HBO app or my TV but airplay works one minute then I get spammed with errors that airplay can’t play the content and to try again later. I force quite the app and it still doesn’t work and gives me the error over and over. It’s really frustrating. As soon as I use airplay with non HBO content it works.
2020-10-19 17:57:16,"New app, needs fixing",1,Tyrah FB,False,"HBO max is relatively new, so I understand some bugs, however I can’t watch a title without issues when trying to skip past episode recap or anything I don’t want to watch. Problems with casting where if you don’t correct the settings immediately, it disconnects your phone from the episode page, making you start the process over."
2020-08-26 18:08:02,Signed up today but...,3,ExecutiveWomen,False,"Hello Developer,
I signed up for HBOMax courtesy of my Xfinity service. I created my account on your website but when I was there: it gave me an option to try your service for free.
I understand that I can watch HBOMax Free anytime now right? I can’t give you 5 Stars until I try first."
2020-10-18 02:41:03,Constant errors and crashes,1,Dekkatek,False,"I use an iPhone running the latest OS streaming through Chromecast as there is no native app for my Vizio TV. It is a rare surprise when I can get through a show or movie without the application crashing, disconnecting, or experiencing some other error. Other streaming apps on the same device work fine. Casting HBO Max to any Chromecast based device always has errors."
2020-10-13 18:48:27,Seeing cancellation in the near future,2,Q 🌫,False,The app has by far the best content with the worst service and layout. The app is so glitchy I’ve had to force close and restart the app every time I’ve used it. The interface is subpar and buffers to no end. I never had these issues with any other streaming service. Please fix!
2020-08-04 01:33:57,Continue Watching Options?,3,burkelsm,False,Why can’t you access a show’s episodes from the continue watching feature? There’s no way to go back episodes unless you search for the show and choose an episode from there...
2020-08-14 04:56:38,What happened,1,hbofan471640,False,"I have an HBO Now account. I use it on my Roku. Now my iPhone HBONow app has transmogrified into this purple thing, which I can’t sign into. Do I need to cancel HBO Now and sign up for an HBO max account? It appears to be the same price/month. Why would you make your customers go through this confusing rigmarole? Thank your lucky stars you still have peerless artists like David Simon making this worth all the trouble."
2020-08-07 20:20:37,"Buggy app, great content",2,ggrimes33,False,"HBO has great content but the app is extremely buggy. I get frequent aspect jumps where the picture seems to change size slightly then jump back again . This is not only an apple app thing, it also happens on the Samsung app on my tv. This isn’t an annoyance I should have to deal with on a pay service."
2020-07-20 03:18:12,Needs a major rework,2,A80tracon,False,"How does a company that has HBOGO and HBO NOW come out with this garbage app?  The layout is awful, the color scheme is ugly, and controlling it with your phone is clunky at best.  And, there’s no sleep function.  On top of all of this, it lags over an hour when new episodes come out for any shows.  That didn’t happen with HBO go.  Pretty disappointed."
2020-06-02 05:31:38,Just... not as easy as it should be :(,2,Dcbritboy,False,"The Hubs: where are they? Or rather, why do you have to scroll through so much other stuff to find them?

Continue watching: shouldn’t this show both the next episode of a series you’ve watching AND shows/movies you may have started but not finished.

My list: how is this not separated by movie and television? 

Download: why the option to “download” so prominent everywhere? Why is it easier to download than it is to figure which episodes you’ve already watched of any particular show (that little purple line... eww... it’s not enough).

Come on HBO Max, we expected better."
2020-07-03 05:21:22,Love Life starting Anna Kendrick,5,Minislayer 2.0,False,The service is great and Love Life is a phenomenal show! I totally recommend buying to just to watch that show along with the perks of everything else it has to offer.
2020-05-28 01:40:24,Great start (?),2,Braveheat,False,"The app is easy to use, very happy that you can download content to watch later.. however... the video quality is horrible, and I mean bad. Disney, Netflix, Prime, all crystal clear video. For context I am using an iPhone X and it is up to date (iOS 13.5). I have also adjusted the app settings for the highest quality.  Still bad. Hurry up HBO max, this is costing money."
2020-05-28 12:03:09,One of my favorite video streaming services to watch! EVER!!,5,GeekOnSleek4,False,"HBO Max is definitely one of the best streaming services to watch!

In this streaming service, there are movies to watch, tv shows to binge, originals to check out, and more!"
2020-10-03 07:05:48,Annoying Buggy App,1,seno2k,False,"I really dislike this app. It’s cumbersome, buggy, not user friendly, and is constantly failing to work. I’m constantly having to restart it just to get content to play on my Google Chrome.  What’s more, HBO forces you to use this mediocre app.  At least in the past I had other options to HBO GO, like Roku.  And for what?  All so HBO can make more money off of my data usage.  Thanks a lot, HBO."
2020-09-24 01:34:58,I can’t believe we are paying so much,1,Maddy31998,False,Guys please get your app together. You are charging more than Netflix and I can’t even find go back to more episodes while from the video. There is no way to go to next episode while watching the current one. I want to say it’s new and it’s a new app but I won’t. You are HBO. You charging so much and there is no excuse. Just poach some Netflix developers.
2020-09-11 20:45:28,Needs some fixing!,3,Smp3541,False,The app runs so slow and takes forever to add shows/movies to your list or go from one thing to the next. There also isn’t a way to fast forward or rewind in larger blocks other than by seconds.
2020-09-06 22:34:26,Does download feature work?,3,Apple.c0m!,False,"I selected download for few episodes and it’s been an hour I don’t see progress. If my suspicion is right and the downloads cannot happen in background, it becomes very useless feature.  Please check."
2020-08-21 02:10:02,Great content app is buggy,3,Tadtheman00,False,Every time I download an episode of a show then close out of the app my download just disappears. I’ve tried deleting the app and reinstalling but doesn’t seem to work. This issue is rather annoying seeing how streaming HBO uses a lot of data.
2020-08-31 18:55:21,It’s all about the money!!,1,BR HOG,True,"HBO was a great app.  Not anymore.  It is now a money grubbing app.  I don’t see keeping my subscription much longer.  In fact, this is all about the money.  I see no reason to keep my subscription.  Looks like Game of Thrones was the high point for HBO, and it is down hill from there.  Pay more money for less, when did that become a good thing.  I think I can live with out it."
2020-08-31 03:15:12,"Great content , just can’t watch it",1,A1lex0,False,"I have yet to be able to watch a single episode or movie without being interrupted by buffering. Sometimes, it would buffer every 5-10 minutes. I have Other streaming services on the same system & have no problems with those and for HBO MAX to be twice as expensive as the others, it feels like a complete rip-off."
2020-06-28 03:41:18,Good alternative until HBO max is on Firestick,3,Cam De Henry,False,"It has everything I wanted and I was able to airplay to my tv, which is awesome. But suddenly it didn’t connect on airplay and now the airplay option in the top right has just disappeared. It seems the app will randomly have its issues."
2020-08-18 18:23:01,Big no from me dawg,1,MorganEmerson816,False,"The app being more expensive then the other streaming apps is one thing, that was more annoying than anything but then I can’t even get it on my fire stick... like there’s not even an app or any thing. Seems poorly executed to me! I would love to be able to watch some of my favorite shows but not on my phone. This is ridiculous..."
2020-07-14 23:16:29,Don’t bother until they are on Roku,1,This is not the real Dave Matthews,False,"Solid selection of content. My issue is lack of an HBO Max Roku app - forcing you to cast from your Apple device to your tv if you have Roku. The casting is clunky, usually stalls when moving to the next episode and good luck if you need to pause. Will take a reboot of the app to get your cast back. Unfortunate that greed between these two large companies equals an inferior streaming experience."
2020-06-30 14:27:29,When will it be on LG TV,4,Regan10🦄🦄🦄,False,I love it it’s cool i get to watch friends but airplay is Brocken hope you’ve had the time to fix it...Also I want it on regular LG TV it’s ridiculous I have go back in the app so I can go to the next episode I don’t hate it I like it...Bye have a good day!
2020-06-16 20:31:43,Great app to be limited to tiny devices,3,Cw30755,False,I like the way this app is laid out. It is intuitive and easy to use. I knocked 2 stars because these old eyes just can’t stand to watch my content on tiny screens. I have a nice 4K TV and I just want to be able to easily stream my content through my Roku box.
2020-06-28 02:17:22,You fixed it!!,5,Poison Oaker,False,"Since the upgrade to HBO Max, I had a conflict with my Chromecast. The video broadcast perfectly, but there was no audio. I just tried my sound bar with HBO Max tonight, and I got sound. Thank you geek squad!!"
2020-05-29 08:33:51,Full screen on laptops etc,3,ssamanthavixtor,False,"I don’t like that it doesn’t automatically go to full screen when the next episode begins. If you’re watching from a laptop on the browser, it will not automatically go to the next episode in FULL screen."
2020-06-04 23:16:30,Works for a week then doesn’t,2,Longrifle7,False,"HBO go didn’t work. Received email from ATT to try the new HBO max so I followed the directions and it worked great... for about a week...
   Then last night I fell asleep watching season 1 of Deadwood
Got off work and tried to continue where it left off or back up two episodes. The HBO max system says my ATT subscription has expired.
  I attempted signing in again and can’t get it to work. It just keeps going back to sign in with your wireless provider. 
      Fix your app people! What a pain in the...
Well you can fill in he last part, I am sure what part of the human anatomy I am referring to"
2020-06-02 04:32:19,Hassle to sign up,1,hannah montana reviews,False,It literally took two adults and over an hour just for us to figure out how to sign up and connect it to my smart tv. Way too much hassle to sign up for it to be that expensive they should make it way easier. I just can’t get over how difficult it was to sign up I have never seen any other streaming service be that complicated.
2020-05-30 18:15:32,Interface is very laggy and not user friendly,1,Skylinev36,False,"There are so many kinks with HBO MAX. The shows take forever to load and sometimes don’t even load at all. Occasionally, I get an error on my screen resulting in the whole screen going black, yet the audio continues to run. There also isn’t an option to skip to the next episode. There is a lot they can learn from Netflix."
2020-05-29 16:39:44,How many HBO apps are there?,1,Hollyyyyz,False,"I’ve had an AT&T unlimited plan for 3 years and HBO something comes with it. I just got a text that I needed to download this app. They’ve changed how to login to HBO at least 4 times in that 3 years (HBO Go, Direct TV something, ATT TV app, now this app). How hard is it to just keep one app? I’m fairly tech savvy, but I feel bad for customer service reps that are going to have to deal with all the confused ppl out there."
2020-10-20 22:13:14,Needs to be available more places.,1,changbackplease12,False,The fact I can only watch HBO max on a phone/computer/iPad pretty much renders it useless. I deal with it for a handful of shows that only I want to watch. But I need it to work on tv for family viewing. Super annoying. HBO it’s time to cave to roku/Apple/Firestick. I definitely won’t pay for this if not. Too many competitors that are way easier to use.
2020-05-28 12:53:00,Loving it!,5,Tuix95,False,"I am a huge fan of HBO for years. So when I know that they are going to launch HBO Max I was in.

The result is perfect for me, but I am a little diasappointed that isn’t any 4K content. Let’s hope it ends up being..."
2020-05-27 16:54:55,Great upgrade,5,Daniel6150,False,I’ve had HBO now for years and this is a really great upgrade if you already had HBO now they gave you max for free once you update the app I’m very excited with the amount of material on here now
2020-10-15 01:43:01,Extremely poor picture quality,1,Mac_User_01,True,"Unlike nearly all of its streaming competitors, HBO Max launched in 2020 without any support for 4K video. 

In contrast, competitors like Netflix have been streaming 4K since 2014, so the glaring lack of 4K support in the HBO Max app suggests a complete lack or care and dedication to quality.

HBO, please make a concerted effort to update this app with video technologies that were offered by your competitors over 6 years ago."
2020-07-24 16:36:51,Please Add AT&T U-verse,3,blwbrook,False,"Now i love everything about this app from fresh prince of bel-air to your favorite childhood movies and shows but how can i watch if my provider isn’t there and i don’t have enough money to pay,i have HBO go but there’s only a few days left before July the 31 so please i beg of you to put AT&T U-verse."
2020-09-24 03:16:03,Downloaded episodes do not work,2,inuchan,False,"There is no point in offering downloaded episodes if the app has a glitch where, when the phone is in airplane mode, it gets stuck in an infinite loop of trying to connect to the server and won’t let you watch the episodes you’ve downloaded."
2020-09-15 02:04:52,Some great shows/ app crashes,2,Mom2twinz2,False,"Fix the app- it’s crap - so we can watch the few good shows you have. When you download a show to watch on iPad, why is it still streaming it, when you go to watch it after you’ve used data to download it?
Not everyone in the world has true unlimited data."
2020-08-24 02:27:31,"Great on the phone, garbage on the television.",1,KMac0717,False,"I started using this app on my phone.  When I downloaded it to my tv, nothing worked right.  It’s buggy and slow.  It takes upwards of 30 minutes sometimes, for a show to begin.  Heaven forbid you want to switch between shows.  It freezes.  I never encountered this on my phone.  I had the exact same issue with HBO Go.  PLEASE FIX!"
2020-07-10 04:30:01,Content great app not so much,3,jmoe1340,False,"I love having access to my favorite shows, but there’s a lot about the app itself I don’t like. First of all I’ve been experiencing problems with signing in on my Apple TV. Also I would like to be able to skip the intro to shows like friends."
2020-07-20 17:27:26,Changing Audio,2,Puppy gin,False,"i bought hbomax specifically for the ghibli content, only to find that the movies were all slightly changed. i don't understand why someone felt a need to change these nostalgic movies and why that person thought it was a good idea. by changed i mean some voice acting lines were switched and altered."
2020-06-29 19:57:53,Smartcast glitched,3,Me-ow 😜,False,I love the app so far but my only problem is when i try to cast it onto my tv it will immediately disconnect. I know it couldn’t be my tv because it works just fine with other streaming services. Hopefully this will be fixed in a future update.
2020-06-15 21:53:47,Download Problems !,3,gysjdq53,False,"This is a great app with great content but it wouldn’t let me download anything. It keeps saying I reached the maximum, even though I haven’t downloaded anything at all!! I want to  download shows to watch on the go but this is stopping me from doing it. HBO has to fix this issue!"
2020-05-31 17:29:17,Can’t get the app,3,Lil nono09,False,"So I’m paying for your streaming service but I cannot download the app on most tv services( firestick, ruku, select smart TVs)? You couldn’t come up with a deal before you launched? Enjoy what’s on the app but the fact that I can’t watch it on anything bigger than my tablet?"
2020-06-13 03:47:58,Confusing and annoying,2,teresenyc,False,Difficult to navigate. Weird layout. Hard to figure out which shows/movies are available with your previous subscription and which is part of hbomax. Confusing even trying to choose which episode of a show you want to watch.
2020-09-29 20:19:48,Default closed captioning,3,obewan99,False,The app switches back to CC on after start of every episode. It doesn’t remember that you turned it off. It would be nice to not have to turn the CC off after the start of every episode. It’s quite annoying.
2020-10-16 20:19:23,Connectivity issue,1,SK10876543,False,"I downloaded a show to watch on the airplane but the app keeps telling me I’m offline even tho I’m on wifi, the show was downloaded to my phone and all my other apps are working. In fact, I’m even able to write this review and submit it.  Seems pretty basic that it should work on wifi with an already downloaded show."
2020-07-11 18:04:35,Not available on all platforms!,2,WillVal,False,"This subscription is useless when I can’t watch same shows on my TV. There is no HBO Max for Roku so at home I have to watch shows on my instead of my TV. You’re paying for a subscription that can’t be used across platforms, want to cancel subscription because of this."
2020-08-26 16:58:59,Just a random question.,4,jgshrjysiywnhwhauhsuht,False,"I like the App and all the shows they have in them and I know this is probably the dumbest thing to ask but if you could, could you please put the show Young Justice in the Dc “Area”."
2020-08-26 01:54:14,Disappointed,1,Vii☺️,False,"I spend my money on the app HBO now, so I pay my share. Yet i cannot use it on my phone, tablet or laptop... because of this “merge” and i think it’s ridiculous that I cannot have access to my content that I pay for on my other devices only on my Roku Tv... 

Fix this... because i have a subscription and I should be able to watch what I want when i want."
2020-08-14 00:00:35,Horrible app doesn’t work,1,theRussian07,False,"If I could give this app 0 stars I would. It simply doesn’t work.
I can’t even log in and haven’t been able to log in for at least 2 days, log in server error messages. What’s the point in paying all this money for content that can’t be viewed or accessed?
Good job HBO. 
Not only is HBO Max unavailable on Roku and DirectTv, but the app doesn’t work on an iPad either."
2020-08-04 16:15:26,Why is this so difficult?,1,Hamstarr,False,"I have HBO but I can’t use this app on my iPad or iPhone. What am I paying for? I don’t care if roku isn’t supported, I am still paying for hbo service where does that money go? I tried to get in and sign up and cancel my other service and it wouldn’t let me.  I don’t understand why so many hoops to jump through, and don’t have time to try to figure it out."
2020-08-02 17:02:36,Very good!,4,My insta: @me_ryan06,False,Has great selection and layout but the free trial is just too short! It’s 15$ a month which is a lot and only 1 week to decide if you want to do that. They stream “Katy Keene” which is such a good show anyone reading this should go watch it!!
2020-07-31 05:35:36,Problems already,5,Blew Jersey 101,False,"Have HBO with my cable provider spectrum. Put the correct login and password for spectrum, click login, and it keeps kicking me back to the HBO Max create an account."
2020-07-03 15:28:32,Offline,1,Czarr101,False,"Definitely not on the same level as the other streamers. Was going away on a trip, where I knew I would have no WiFi. Did what anyone would do, downloaded a few episodes to have available to watch. Definitely did not work the way the others do. DID NOT PLAY, it said it was downloaded but only the loading sign would pop up"
2020-06-16 11:19:35,Very disappointed!,3,Onaishaop,False,"I’m extremely disappointed that this is only available on mobile devices. If this service doesn’t become available for my television soon, I will be canceling my subscription. It’s not available for Roku or Firestick."
2020-06-23 19:04:21,Glitchy app,2,Prof. Doom,True,"App is glitchy. Keep getting using cellular warning even though the episode is downloaded. My cellular usage is up for the month so I suspect it is really using my cellular data for some reason.

Edit- contacted customer support and they took me I have to go to my download to access the downloaded episode. I still get the cellular warning and a lot of time I have to go into airplane mode to avoid this. 

Can’t pick an episode from continue watching need to search for the show to pick a different episode.

Overall not happy with the app compared to other streaming services."
2020-08-13 00:34:12,It’s cool but,3,A02468,False,"Every time i exit the app to check my notifications or stuff, the app restarts itself. Every single time. Having me click back the movie or show was watching, rather than being paused like i left it before switching to another app"
2020-05-27 23:58:17,Awesome,5,AD437,False,"HBO max is awesome especially with all the movies and tv shows that I like on here. I can wait to watch looney tones, Friends, and many other. The only thing I disappoint is that there no 4K/ HDR hopefully they will add it in the future."
2020-09-09 05:07:32,Straight crap.,1,ml131045,False,"I search google to find Harry Potter for my nieces that have been wanting to watch them and I came across hbomax on google stating that they did in fact stream it. I downloaded and Paid for it and they don’t have it. I went ahead and reached out to customer service to ask what was going on. They said they no longer are streaming it, so umm yea.  Downloaded it for nothing."
2020-09-07 05:39:22,Why spend money on a app,1,Nick 5667ytBst123,False,You have to subscribe to watch an episode how about using adds instead you might not get the same amount of money but you still make money off adds why waste your hard earned money that you can use it on better things like food and hardware stuff i can’t watch my Selena + chef episodes on any apps because its only for HBMO max 😕
2020-09-04 20:40:29,So many streaming issues,1,DJGSP,False,"It already has so many streaming issues from the app to other devices. Half of the times wouldn’t work. But how with the latest update streaming to any of my TV s from the app doesn’t work at all. You really need to fix this issue as having an LG tv (which doesn’t have an HBO app), streaming from my phone is my only option."
2020-08-27 21:43:39,Get it together,1,awitsman84,False,"This is a perfect example of someone getting in a hurry and not previewing an app before publishing it. I’m finding that signing in is near impossible to complete between the purple scrolling dots and the rotating ring popping up in the way. Why are there two loading screens? I get all the way to the end of the process and it either locks up, or kicks me off."
2020-07-18 02:02:00,Why no trailers?,3,JoeSloth,False,"Seriously, previews for shows should be in the MVP for the product. Not having trailers is going to cause users to either not watch new content, or watch 10 minutes of content and then bounce, which could result in false analytics data forfor the show."
2020-08-07 19:12:00,Be careful with downloads on airplane mode.,1,Davedisimo,False,"This app doesn’t load if you’re offline. I downloaded 3 episodes to watch during a flight but at the moment I tried to open the app in my iPad it never worked. This app tries to verify your login information every single time its open. Boomer. 
Right now they are miles and miles away from the Netflix app. Disappointing."
2020-06-06 17:53:06,Good but could use improvement,3,Eborgman,False,"I like the scope of choices to watch, however I have a couple caveats: the quality is low when you first start a video, the app lags at times, and I wish there was an option to skip the theme songs."
2020-06-18 01:11:22,Stupidest thing ever!’,1,confused as tf,False,Can HBO explain to me if I have an HBO now subscription but I can’t sign in to make because my subscription isn’t supported and when I try to log in HBO now using my mobile phone internet it tries to open up in HBO max. Clearly no one thought any of this through. This has been such in inconvenience. Why pay for a monthly subscription that I can’t use when I’m not at home?
2020-06-08 15:50:49,Amazing Content!,5,n/a_20,False,"Content is amazing and is superior to the other options available today.   No issues with app, great offer!"
2020-05-30 14:52:40,Audio issues,3,natcatlovee,False,I know I did not wait this long to watch Doctor Who for free just so the audio can go bad. Not even 5 minutes into an episode and the audio goes from English to Spanish. The app has no options to check the language options.
2020-05-31 18:17:25,Lost the ability to watch HBO on my iPad,1,NorcalScott,False,"So, HBO just kills the HBO Now app in favor of the HBO Max app, but since I (and millions of others) subscribe through Roku, I can no longer use the HBO app on my iPad.  Seriously?  I am a subscriber and I pay $15 per month to watch HBO and you lock me out on my device?

Wow, this is about the most anti-consumer move I have ever seen.

Why not leave the HBO Now up until you figure things out with Roku?"
2020-10-10 00:33:12,Love the content but horrible functionality,2,Slovacek28,False,This app gets stuck constantly. Moving from one episode to another or browsing content it will freeze my entire device.  Please fix it because I love the content but it’s not worth having to reboot my devise every time I watch something.
2020-05-27 22:11:06,Great App with One Flaw,4,AndyPSU71,False,Love all the new content. Please add the ability to create PIN codes for adults. I have two kids and at any time they can open and go into my profile and watch R movies. The adults should have pin codes too.
2020-10-04 05:47:48,Oh boy,2,tanin1993,False,I love the shows and movies but I got a smart tv (just like most) and it doesn’t support the app so I have to use my husband’s Xbox and it’s very inconvenient because he plays while I watch and there’s even issues with the app there as well. Please get this fixed ASAP and I will for sure believe this is a app worth for 4 stars.
2020-08-27 23:24:13,It was working but now is not,2,Winkie2111111,False,The app keeps asking me to link my provider which I have done. Then it will go to my home page. I will select three show and click on pay. Then it will take me back to link my provider. I am not able to watch anything for over 2 weeks now
2020-09-07 01:37:12,Terrible rollout of the new platform,1,hbomax is the worst,False,I recently signed up for HBO now on my fire stick. I haven’t had access to and won’t have access to my fire stick for three weeks. I have no ability to cancel the subscription I have no access to and I’m paying for until I’m back home because there is no way to sign in on an iPhone (only hbo max which I don’t have)
2020-06-28 06:19:00,Love it...when it works,3,C-twins,False,There’s nothing worse than finding a good series to watch and getting into binge mode but the next time I tap the app on my iPhone it tells me “We’re having issues connecting to HBO Max. Please try again later”. Ugh. This never happens with Netflix! C’mon!!
2020-08-26 01:34:22,Great selection.....if I could watch it,2,rleboo,False,"There are so many things I’d love to watch, but unfortunately after 2-5 minutes it stops playing.  I have other streaming services and I’ve rarely had an issue watching on my IPad.  

Get it together.  Also,  why aren’t you on Roku?  I’m close to cancelling my 20+ year HBO subscription."
2020-08-13 15:27:03,I love the wide range of content,2,nicoleleo12,False,I love the wide range of content but u have a roku tv and a fire stick and I can not find this app at all on neither roku nor fire stick. The only option I have is to use the HDMI chord to plug into my tv from my laptop. I just want to know when can we expect to see this app on all online media players?
2020-06-30 17:40:22,Please Put The App on Roku,2,Tnapscy385,False,"I love all the content.  Its pretty good, BUT I don’t want to watch on my cellphone or other mobile devices all the time.  As a matter of fact I am NOT going to watch on mobile devices all the time.  I don’t want to. So that being said I will still be giving other streaming services the majority of my attention."
2020-06-16 03:43:59,Stupid app,3,sweetiepiecheeks,False,"Whenever you log in it doesn’t allow you to switch between your email and back to the app to verify your email address

It’s a mobile app not available on other platforms so it doesn’t make sense"
2020-06-05 08:12:37,Downloaded videos,3,Dre' gizzele,False,When I watch a downloaded movie offline and exit app midway in. The movie won’t start up where I left off in movie when i play again.  I have to fast forward and get to where i left off. It’s an annoying glitch
2020-09-19 03:38:45,Needs work,3,CarlosG310,False,"Great show lineup!!! App needs work!

It’s better now that you have added intro skips. But still would be nice to have a offline mode. Hence while traveling (which I do a lot of) when I don’t have signal ha e the ability to watch downloaded content!"
2020-05-28 11:15:22,Spectrum customer - still can't sign in,1,Thop8041,False,"After multiple attempts following the instructions on the HBO Max website (clearing cache in Safari, turning phone off and on again, multiple uninstalls and reinstalls of the HBO Max app), I'm still unable to login with my TV provider (Spectrum). It's not on Spectrum's end either, as I'm having no problem whatsoever signing in to the HBO Go app with my provider info... Please fix this!"
2020-10-11 00:57:59,Hit or Miss,2,fudnchfhc,False,A lot of the time the app says I need to connect to WiFi or change settings. I connected to WiFi and nothing and then I tried to use the data on my phone and still nothing. It just keeps saying connect to WiFi. Sometimes it’ll work and other times not.
2020-10-05 19:51:37,DISAPPOINTED,1,Gggglllleeeennnn,False,"Shows are great (duh it’s HBO) but the app itself is severely lacking in major, but simple things. When casting to a TV, it is incredibly cumbersome and unwieldy. Especially so when you’re trying to ffw/rewind. With the massive success of HBO, I expected an app where they didn’t cut quite so many corners. HBO GO was better. And that is saying something. This app is trash and is in desperate need of a complete overhaul. Pathetic effort."
2020-08-13 21:17:01,Download function is terrible,2,Madnuke,False,Why have ability to download a movie if you have to have an Internet connection to watch it. That makes no sense nevertheless it will not load unless you have an Internet connection. Low quality app not what I expected when they killed off HBOGo.
2020-09-18 01:36:44,Terrible already,1,alexmano,False,"I added hbo to my xfinity plan through the website. Checked my tv, hbo channel was working. 

Then I downloaded hbo max on my iPhone 11, signed in through my provider (xfinity), it loads the xfinity website within the hbo max app and tells me to add hbo to my xfinity plan! 
I’ve deleted the app, cleared browser, tried about 10 times. Called the Hbo max customer service they didn’t know what to do. Called xfinity, also clueless. 

I’m going I give it 48 hours, if it still won’t let me in after that, canceling. 

P.S. To the developers, don’t bother replying to my review with the customer service solution unless you know what the problem is."
2020-08-04 01:19:25,High Cost Low Quality Video,2,mds20,False,I can’t believe for the price they charge that the video is so poor. I have a high end TV and a very fast internet service and I still get motion artifacts and poor picture quality. Just crazy that the transmission picture is still 1080P. Upscaling has to be done by your own hardware.
2020-08-07 22:08:07,very glitchy and not worth the price to use,1,thislunarbeauty,False,"$15 for a terrible user interface..watching tv shows is difficult, there is no option to go to the next episode directly without going back to “my list” and scrolling down to whatever episode you’re on. the app is also bad at loading the next episode if you’re on the end credits of the previous one still. there also isn’t an option to skip opening credits so you have to press the “skip 30 seconds” button multiple time and wait for buffer. honestly don’t know how they’re allowed to charge so much for such a terrible app"
2020-06-28 20:31:30,Needs better accessibility support.,2,Bluesman325,False,"Great content! However, the iOS version of the app needs better voice over support as it is currently almost impossible for someone who is blind to navigate the interface. What is interesting though is that the Apple TV version of the app does work with voiceover."
2020-07-31 00:12:48,Logging in is a nightmare,1,theymademepickanickname07,False,"This app is arguably the worst to login on your devices. I am clearly signed in on my computer, and it will not recognize any of my login info. It was a pain to do on hbo go, and this is just a hellish experience. If it weren’t included in my cell plan I would 100% NOT pay for this. I am not one to make reviews unless they are positive, but this makes me wanna break things. Pray for me"
2020-06-18 07:31:04,Skip intro needed,4,MoeZArts,False,It’s 2020 and I still have to fast forward to skip intros manually. Love the app and the content but it needs the option to skip all these intros on web and mobile.
2020-06-25 06:12:48,Why are you kicking out subscribers?!,1,Bozata,True,"If a person has iOS v11 or below they cannot watch HBO even if they subscribe. This app is downloadable but refuses to work. Going to the web site using a browser leads you to the same downloadable app that does not work.
How does anyone watch HBO on iPhone 5 for example?
Just received a confirmation from the developer that they indeed cut off older devices."
2020-06-18 18:17:16,Content beyond HBO,5,Jhawkwba,False,"So excited to see the content beyond HBO’s impressive library.  From Doctor Who to South Park on the way as well as exciting DC Universe content, I now have plenty to explore and binge under these pandemic conditions! #ATTemployee"
2020-06-05 02:08:41,Going to have to cancel,1,BethMP22,False,"I was really excited for this launch, but it seems i will have to cancel before i can even really try it out. I love ROKU TVs set up so all the TVs in my house are this kind. Unfortunately you all can’t come to an agreement so i can’t use the service on anything but my phone. $15 a month is way too much to pay for something i can’t use 🤷🏼‍♀️.
So disappointed."
2020-09-03 22:14:58,Stop with the ads,3,nickaaname,False,"Stop with the promos before shows. Just play the show I want. And yes, you made it so I can skip promos now, but I have to do it with every show. Either just stop the promos or let me opt out of them with one choice, not episode by bleeping episode."
2020-09-29 23:24:02,New update made things worse,2,rljonz843,False,"The most recent update doesn’t seem to have done anything but change some aesthetic pieces of the app. But now the app won’t cast to my smart tv. Everything was working just fine before the update. 

Selection is great. New originals are great. But the app itself lacks"
2020-09-06 22:37:58,Won’t stream video from iPhone to TV using Apple lightning to hdmi connection,2,Frosty304,False,"Like the app, but when connecting it to my tv from my iPhone using the actual Apple lightning to hdmi cord, only gives audio, and no video. Unplug the cord and can see video on my phone. Makes it hard to watch a movie with the family."
2020-08-26 07:24:27,This is okay,3,J.Chand,False,Okay the downloading of movies or shows that you like is a very nice feature that a lot of apps have but this countdown of day that we have left till it’s removed is stupid change that way please other than that it’s a great app
2020-07-24 21:25:33,Needs landscape navigation also,3,MrTexOil,False,"Cmon bruh! Most shows/movies are presented in 16:9. So it only makes sense that since you are allowed to rotate your phone 90 degrees and enjoy the show/movie, you should also be allowed to navigate the app in landscape mode and not just portrait."
2020-08-23 09:39:27,HBO is ruined,1,Kgeorge84,False,"This app is the worst premium provider app I have. I had HBO go but was “upgraded” to HBO max thru my AT&T cellular plan as well as my Xfinity plan. 
At first I was able to log in with my Xfinity credentials. Now I can log in with anything! It says I’m logged in & asks me to pick a provider, even though it clearly shows I’m signed in with Xfinity. It’s a never ending cycle! At this point, I’m so done with everything HBO & AT&T!"
2020-08-19 17:16:53,Buffers too often,2,Zeusy22,False,"The app buffers even when the videos are downloaded. It makes absolutely no sense. 

It also MUST have an online connection to even log into the app. My movie was unavailable during a plane trip due to that. The loading screen just kept spinning."
2020-08-18 21:22:15,HBO MAX Awesome,4,Sweets Shaner,False,I'm not a big fan of change but this being added to my HBO account on Direct TV is something I really thought was going to make my app experience awful. I have to admit it but with it being free with my existing account I LOVE IT!
2020-08-14 03:48:30,Good idea but....,2,ecc6565,False,I will not let me sign on with my cox account currently it makes me change my password every couple of weeks I did not have to do that with hbo go just frustrated have not been able to use in a couple of days .  Keep getting error oops something went wrong.
2020-07-16 01:06:06,Needs skip into feature,3,jdennis4797,False,"I really like the content of this streaming service, but I do not like the inability to skip the intro on tv shows. Please add this feature in, it’s very frustrating to have to see the intro each time a new episode starts."
2020-07-01 22:26:58,Needs Modern Features,3,rickdwaters,False,"Next episode. Skip intro. These are standard features available in other streaming services like Netflix and Prime Video. Get it together, folks over at HBO. 

Also, can you kiss and make up with Roku? Would really like to stream this on their platform."
2020-07-10 20:17:21,Incapable of retaining data,1,Xyxgy2,False,"I hate this app with the burning rage of 1000 suns. Tried to download a movie for a flight, it errored out at 99%. Tried to download the same movie for my return flight home, succeeded... and the app lost it like I had never downloaded it. Garbage. In the modern era with a million choices streaming apps, get literally any other app if you want to actually watch things."
2020-06-14 07:34:53,Not a competitive app in 2020,3,prodan1,False,"The content is great but the app is just a reskin of the HBO NOW one. No 4K, HDR/Dolby Vision or Dolby Atmos and no LG TV app. Also, it doesn’t work outside of the US even in countries where HBO is available. And on top of that it’s 2x more expensive per month compared to Disney+ and Netflix which both do the listed above."
2020-06-29 00:14:45,10/10 but I have a problem,5,pp size over 9000,False,The movie/show are awesome there so much but it won’t allow me to connect it to anything
2020-06-24 22:55:46,Almost Perfect,4,iAmLegend718,False,Please add an option to manually change stream quality from HD to SD (1080p/720p/480p). The UI is great and very fast. Also it’s simple to login with existing ISP account and being able to download is great when offline!
2020-06-17 10:40:45,"Would be great, but...",1,Hollrams,False,"I was super excited about this service because of all the great titles available but sadly, I can only watch on my phone and computer. I, like so many others, use a Fire stick and Roku to stream on. Therefore, I cancelled my free trial immediately because it wasn’t being utilized. Once HBO Max becomes available on other platforms I’ll sign up again I’m sure!"
2020-05-28 19:58:49,It’s pretty good,4,nada l,False,"I have the hbo channel on fios do it was pretty easy to sign up. I started binging the hp movies right away, and I’m pretty excited to start watching some new tv shows, although i expected a little more, i think hbo max is alright."
2020-06-09 12:32:22,WTH?!,1,hummingbird95,False,"I have HBO Now, but the HBO Max has taken over and I can’t access anything without having to pay for it...AGAIN! Nope. Not today, Satan. Y’all need to do better. There should have been an integration between the two so that HBO Now customers can log in to HBO Max and pick up where we left off. I also have Roku and it’s sucking there too. HBO, y’all dropped the ball on this one. Big time. Please fix this mess."
2020-05-27 15:36:54,To expensive!,1,palermo!!!,False,"Too expensive for content a lot of old stuff on here.
Plus with the Coronavirus that is halting production!!! it’s definitely not worth this kind of money they should have you pay nine or $10 a month but not locked in for a year which is the special that they had going on why would I want to keep this for a year not enough new content."
2020-05-28 02:05:45,Bravo,5,TheLegend5000,False,Nice service and they went and got the boondocks added onto it. That alone is a must for me to sign up. Of course rick and morty being my other favorite comedy show. What a deal
2020-07-09 18:48:41,Roku Support,3,DJoe89,False,"I like the content, but the fatigue from having to watch the shows I like on a iPad forced me to end my subscription. I’m not an “on the go” viewer unless I’m traveling, so not having the ability to stream the contents of this app on a larger screen eventually became unbearable."
2020-05-27 12:43:41,Big Upgrade,5,Telfah Tells the News,False,"The aesthetics are beautiful and the selection is insane.
I’ve never seen this many options in my entire life."
2020-05-27 08:58:20,Best streaming service,5,salito222,False,"Out of all the streaming service that I have used and enjoyed, this has to be the best one. The content that HBO MAX has is amazing. Sadly no 4k but hopefully soon they will have It."
2020-08-12 18:25:35,Horrible,1,yblvic1434,False,Compared to the other show apps this app is so bad and you have to have WiFi for it to really work at that and it’s slow and always restarting and freezing you guys need to fix a lot on this app it’s so bad smh I have it for one show and can barley watch it because you guys app is so bad just horrible whoever is the developer needs to be fired
2020-08-12 02:43:23,Lineup is a joke,1,renchhcnarf dressing,False,"The app itself it’s pretty well put together but the lineup is absolutely horrible. Some good old shows from my childhood, some classic movies that I’ll never watch, but all these are few and far between, the rest of the shows and movies are indie films I’ve never heard of, hbo max originals that I’ll never watch, or super old movies that are just generally uninteresting."
2020-08-10 22:45:24,Great!,5,doglover1029239,False,This app is amazing for watching shows but one problem needs to be more content and it’s kinda glitchy
2020-08-08 02:59:27,HBO max,4,Haydel da Hitman,False,"Big improvement from go and now. I like the new aesthetic, it would be nice to see more titles at once and to have a few more categories. Based on content alone it is easily five stars."
2020-09-11 17:18:27,Excited but......,3,pt950nomad,False,"Already have HBO and excited for the extra content that is available.....but....

I literally have to connect my computer to my TV in order to watch.....there’s no way to screen mirror or cast to my tv from laptop/iPhone, and no app for my LG smart tv."
2020-06-25 12:23:28,Please provide an option to turn off auto play,4,Friday July,False,"I love the app and content, especially the new addition of South Park, but please provide an option to turn off auto play."
2020-06-22 01:18:40,Actively hostile to users,1,lip16,False,"By cutting off integration with Apple TV channels, HBO made the experience of using this app—and even signing in to this app—needlessly complicated and prone to errors. This would be hostile to users even if everything worked perfectly; but with problems signing in (and even confusion about how to sign in) it’s especially inexcusable. An unforced error that I hope HBO will correct soon."
2020-06-17 12:47:11,Offline watching,4,RealAngelcas,True,Thank you for fixing offline watching with the latest update. Now it’s working like it should. No more leeching of data. Would give it a 5 if it was Roku compatible.
2020-06-05 22:40:27,Don’t waste your money,1,slacr95,False,Only able to play videos on my phone and even those videos don’t stay on for very long due to the app shutting down every 30 minutes. Can’t connect any show to my chrome cast whatsoever. Sad because there are a lot of great shows on the app but if none of them can play then what’s the point? Canceling my subscription ASAP ✌🏾
2020-06-02 00:40:36,Bugs,4,Eli2.0,False,"Everytime I AirPlay from my iPhone to AppleTv and I get a notification on my phone it stops playing the movie. It’s super annoying, I didn’t have these issues before the new update."
2020-05-29 10:01:45,What’s going on?,1,entertainme3,False,HBO please get it together! I was just using HBO NOW before the app changed to HBO MAX everything was fine then the app changes to HBO MAX and it is now saying that my provider doesn’t support it? I am subscribed to HBO NOW so aren’t I suppose to have access?!?! Also why is the HBO NOW app all of a sudden gone? Now I can’t watch HBO at all! And on top of that it’s not available on roku tv which I happen to have! Such a mess!!!!
2020-10-04 22:02:49,Absolute trash of an application,1,humansareembarrasing,False,"App is terrible. You have to download every show you want to watch and then the shows you do download, expire after a short time. What’s the point of me downloading it? Also they hide the option for you to delete the app because they know it’s the only way to keep people on it. Pathetic, do better hbo."
2020-10-04 17:53:01,Can’t even get HBO Max Set Up,1,ssssssssssssssssp,False,"I just got HBO Max through an AT&T plan my wife and I just purchased, and whenever I try to set up HBO Max on my phone, it keeps telling me there’s an unhandled exception and I can’t proceed any farther. I’ve restarted my phone, uninstalled and installed the HBO Max app again and restarted my phone but nothing seems to work. This app is completely broken and unusable for me."
2020-08-14 21:56:46,Subtitles or languages,4,Sergiocass21,False,"I had HBO Now, HBO Go and now HBO Max my question is are we ever getting subtitles in diferent languages or dub movies or series to other languages at less Spanish I want my daughters to watch tv in Spanish I don’t want them to forget about it"
2020-09-06 23:02:51,Terrible,1,liveandletdieaxl,False,This entire service is terrible. I wasted money that I’ll never get back. I tried to watch a show after I subscribed and it kept telling me to subscribe and come back and Log I’m. I was already logged in! Don’t waste your money on this service. It makes you go through iTunes to subscribe rather than go through the website.
2020-09-01 07:24:07,Not working,1,DonLeonNYC,False,"HBO Go was my favorite streaming app b4 I was forced onto this app. I was excited since HBO Go was so good, I’d figured HBO Max would be even better + it had Fresh Prince. I get it free with my AT&T Unlimited Elite plan and it no longer allows me to login. When I login it takes me to the profiles page for a second and then takes me back to the subscribe page. It is very frustrating."
2020-08-21 21:44:19,HBO Not being on Roku is a big problem,1,Trent 555,False,"I don’t understand how there isn’t an app for super popular HBO on the most popular streaming device. Aggravating enough to drop both HBO and Roku. The customer is the one who that suffers for their lack of cooperation.  You have to either by another device to view on TV or drop HBO.  Being a loyal customer, I shouldn’t be put in that situation."
2020-07-28 00:42:59,Needs A Skip Button,3,OrunemaK,False,The interface isnt the most intuitive. When watching a series the first page back should be all the episodes for that series. There NEEDS to be a skip recap and skip intro button.
2020-07-14 16:10:06,Roku,3,MissMusicManiac001,False,"I am really enjoying the HBO Max inclusion in my package, but having to watch from either a phone or small device is sometimes frustrating. Having a Roku Smart TV HBO Max app would definitely resolve the main issues we’re having with Max in my household."
2020-07-04 18:03:33,"Good, but",3,Benji 3.0,False,"Decent selection, GREAT UI and feature list (looking at you, Disney+) but I wish I could control the stream quality. On data it defaults to highest quality, eating through 25GB in 7 hours. Sometimes I’m okay watching it at 480 or 720p in the name of data savings."
2020-07-09 05:27:10,So complicated,2,Fef126,False,"The content is great but the app is not good.
I have my account through ATT every two three days I need to log in again. 
And now I log in and it goes to the suscribe now screen so I can’t even use the app
Really frustrating to not being able to use something I paid monthly"
2020-07-08 15:32:20,Downloading episodes still uses data,1,Rueff08,False,"I download episodes on my phone to watch on lunch at work so not to use my cellular data. 

Tell me what’s the point of downloading an episode if you’re still going to burn through my cell data to stream it. I now have 25 days left in my cycle with half of my data because of this app... two thumbs down."
2020-05-29 01:17:32,"Great content, horrible user interface",3,Yes I'm obsessed w/Disney,False,"The content is great, however, the UI could use some major work. The video controls are very ugly and there are many glitches within the app. Disney+ has a much more beautiful and sophisticated UI."
2020-06-25 05:01:47,Need a skip button,5,starrrrlight1988,False,Never have problem with HBO MAX. Only one thing that I missing is skip button on shows.
2020-09-02 12:51:15,Ok but....,3,Henbell1,False,Was working great until a few days ago where I can no longer go to my continue watching and go through the seasons. For whatever reason it will only show the specific episode
2020-09-26 18:14:08,Bro I can’t even buy a subscription lol,1,i have never been more mad,False,Horrible horrible. I thought this was supposed to work on an IPhone. A computer. Nothing. I’m just trying to watch friends y’all and I can’t even shove my money down your throat. Stop buying out shows underneath streaming services that actually work and start working on making a better designed app.
2020-07-03 05:05:24,Audio issues,3,theoriginalwjburr,False,The audio is way too dynamic. I have to turn the volume to max to be able to hear dialogue. Then things get loud and they get really loud. I don’t want to have to watch with my finger on the volume control. It’s called a compressor people.
2020-09-02 06:05:45,Skip intro,5,I am Scott a,True,"I complained that theres no skip intro button, the very next day there’s an update with a skip intro button. I’m choosing to not believe this was a coincidence"
2020-08-16 11:53:59,No Roku Use,2,Twobadgers,False,I liked the app’s functionality and the content was good. The problem in our house is all our TVs are Roku enabled and Max is not on Roku.  So it is small screen only in our house. I kept it a month to see if HBO was just finalizing a deal with Roku but it sounds like that fight will continue.  So I am unsubscribing until then.
2020-08-14 21:40:46,Good content (for now) terrible interface on mobile apps,2,Gante023,False,Why can’t I access the entire episode library from my keep watching list on mobile app? Why is there no skip intro? Why is it so slow to load (compared to Netflix..... which is cheaper and works better).
2020-07-18 15:48:08,"Great app, horrible Customers Service",2,Giocmusseb,False,"The Customers Services his horrible. They don’t know how to answer any questions and don’t to resolve the important problems especially when your account was hacked. I like the app and the content. But, please change the the people of the Customers Services."
2020-07-08 07:21:26,great app,5,Cool dude 103,False,I don’t understand all the negative reviews. All shows are wonderful and the movie selection fantastic. I see a very promising future in this app. Good work HBO!
2020-05-28 02:44:49,SO buggy with Chromecast,3,Helveticat,False,This is a note to the developers: please fix this buggy new app! The previous HBO NOW app worked fine as of late. The app frequently freezes and I have to restart the app and my TV — and this is every hour or so. It ruins the user experience.
2020-05-27 22:59:42,Fire Stick?,3,kbgf,False,"Is really nice that there’s place that we can all see DC WB and so much more affiliated networks in only one app. I love it, but there’s no app for Fire Stick or Roku so I cannot stream on any of those devices. How ever on the broadcast The app crashes on all of the TVs of the house which a really  bad thing."
2020-09-06 23:57:07,List view please,3,jayfray26,False,"It takes forever to browse through the movies when you’re only seeing a few images at a time. Please consider a list view toggle, or at least smaller thumbnails."
2020-10-12 22:22:27,"Great app,but needs some help",2,Eaglesvan,False,"I truly enjoy the HBO max app but I noticed it’s holding memory space on my iPad even for deleted old downloads. I have even uninstalled the app and when I download again the old downloads follow from the cloud. Delete means delete, it’s not that hard to figure out."
2020-08-03 20:15:40,Add a skip intro feature,3,Randallxhood,False,How does HBO Max not have this simple feature that all of their competitors already have? It would make streaming and binge watching shows even better. It’s the little things that go a long way
2020-10-16 00:00:05,Controls,3,douchepod,False,"Could we get some kind of interface when streaming to devices? Once the video gets streamed to a tv via device, there is no way to control play, stop, pause, etc."
2020-08-02 20:12:19,Really fun a lot of different TV shows wish more movies tho,5,penguinfox233,False,There still came out with it but they need to add more still
2020-08-02 17:28:24,Does not work for AT&T customer,1,S_A_Longhorn,False,"Since it’s launch and the “free” use of it as an AT&T internet customer, it does not allow me to view anything. Got the first glitches fixed eventually and all was well for a few days. Now it is in an endless loop of signing in or linking my subscription.

Can not view anything again. Worst experience yet"
2020-07-26 14:06:46,Poor Experience,1,Wade from ICT,False,I got where I log in through my cable provider Cox. I am in an endless loop where it just keeps asking me to log in and nothing works. Shame that I wasted the time to set up for my family on all our devices. What a waste of time. We are deleting the app from everything and won’t be back. Stick to Netflix and Disney+.
2020-07-18 00:56:33,The worst app,1,gjfdrdhjfcvjj,False,"This is the worst app, not user friendly at all.   I have this on my phone and use AirPlay to my TV at home, as soon as my phone times out then the show disconnects... super annoying.   If I’m watching a short series, and the phone goes into sleep mode, then it won’t continuously play the next episode.  NEVER an issue with HBO go.... why is this an issue now?!??"
2020-06-18 05:32:36,Disappointed it’s not available for Firestick,2,Mashayshayy,False,"HBO max has many great shows and movies to watch, but I’m very disappointed that it’s not available for Firestick or Roku. I would definitely update my rating to be higher if it was more readily available, as I can only watch on my computer currently."
2020-06-08 00:41:03,Awesome Content,5,AbbyRJ,False,"I am a long time HBO fan, and was anticipating HBO Max since the announcement. After checking out the app, I was surprised at how much content was on there. I especially love Cartoon Network and TCM on there."
2020-06-04 06:35:01,Great app PLEASE add more bachelor nation seasons,5,kevinr1,True,"Love this app and I use it all the time but I would love some more bachelor, bachelorette and bachelor and paradise seasons US! I would also love if you could add the show icarly pls! Thanks!!"
2020-06-01 05:31:59,Broken system,1,bryus,False,"I have the HBO channel on my Apple TV 4K. Nearly every time I want to watch a show that is in MAX it says it needs to update the app. Why? I don’t know. The better question is why do I need the app when the HBO channel doesn’t need an app? 

Then, there’s my iPhone, which takes me to the app and then won’t let me watch because it doesn’t think I’m a subscriber."
2020-06-01 05:00:33,Stupid,1,trinidad87,False,What the world so now I can’t watch my shows somebody was bored what to upgrade and rename did more stuff so now I have to cancel something still not get my money back charge me I can’t watch I don’t have cable so that’s why I downloaded the app until now !!!! Ugh !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Can’t even watch in my browser all the stupid redirects ugh !!!!!!!!!! Just stupid !!
2020-06-01 03:24:39,Not a good idea,1,mstinymac706,False,It was really a bad idea to automatically convert the HboNow app to max and remove the ability the view your subscription thru an app any longer. Did you guys not realize that laptop viewing is not practical for everyone when a tv isn’t available? Guess I have to cancel now since Mobile is no longer an option
2020-05-30 10:44:38,Automatic Update Renders App Useless for Roku Subscribers,1,Milton42,False,"I subscribe to HBONow via Roku so this automatic update makes viewing HBONow impossible as HBO could not make a deal with Roku. 

I never asked to for HBOMax. I thought it would be nice to have access via now, but today I just wanted to catch up on an HBO show. And because of the update, I cannot log in!

Please bring HBONow access back or figure out your stuff with Roku."
2020-05-29 14:05:20,Directv won’t login,1,Dhenz333,False,"I have directv with hbo and I’m logged into the hbo go app, but hbo max claims it can not verify my subscription. This all day without resolution. Ridiculous. 

Edit: day 3 and still no directv login resolution. Hbo is literally taking people’s money during a pandemic without actually offering the services they’ve been selling for months ahead of the release. Your business plan will fail hbo"
2020-05-28 18:32:03,HBO max is a must have,5,cafeta8,False,"Really good so far, content is good I’m sure it’ll get better,  the lay out needs work to make it easer to find stuff but overall it works"
2020-10-01 00:27:14,Crash and burn,3,BreakBread84,False,"The app does an excellent job while streaming, but I’m having quite a bit of difficulty downloading anything and then playing it back.

Was really looking forward to watching a couple movies along my road trip, got everything downloaded and thought I’d be set.

Not the case.  The app repeatedly crashed and reloaded on its own, only to repeat the same error message.

Love the content.  Streaming ability gets a 8/10, but the download option is haggard."
2020-08-19 08:52:11,"Good shows, but",3,kelllllllloggs,False,I’m stationed overseas in Japan & i cant watch anything because the “area” i’m in doesn’t allow me to. i can’t help where i’m located at and if i’m paying for a subscription i’d like to watch some shows. location requirements are stupid
2020-09-29 16:44:10,I don’t see the value in this subscription anymore,1,Mr.Awesome11111,False,"I’ve been subscribed for at least 4 years and I simply don’t see the value anymore unless I want to watch old movies I’ve already seen before. I’d rather pay to rent 2-3 movies a month that I choose. Also, do you know who definitely doesn’t use the term “latinx”? Latino people like myself."
2020-08-03 03:16:39,HBO Go was better,3,firemadz,False,This new service/app lacks a Start Over command for movies.  It is frustrating that the only option is to continue where you left off or rewind a movie or show to the beginning.
2020-08-13 19:17:06,"Good Shows but, Bad App",1,Akhshshshshs,False,"HBO Max has great shows and everything but your app is really bad. To sign in with my tv provider is a long and exhausting mission. I still can’t sign in with it. Every time I try to sign in it says “Oops, something went wrong!”. I’ve had to delete the app and everything more than once. I’d appreciate if you guys would fix this issue."
2020-07-31 02:13:12,Closed Captioning and other options for people with disabilities,3,( () ),False,It’s a good streaming with a lot of options but it’s closed captioning does not work. Also audio with description would be great and expand accessibility to other users
2020-07-05 14:57:04,No favorites option,3,Vane21ssa,False,I like the variety of options given what I don’t like is the function where u can add a watch list.. there’s no where to continue watching a series needs improvement
2020-07-16 00:30:52,HBO MAX IS SO FRUSTRATING!,1,smans_,False,"I have a Roku TV and Cox cable. So I cannot watch HBO Max on my smart TV or through my cable provider even though I use my cox credentials to login to HBO Max??? Why does cox contour not have an HBO Max app when they have Netflix and Prime? Bottom line, I’m not going to watch it through my phone so HBO just lost a subscriber even though it came to me FOR FREE through cox. If I can’t watch it on my tv I’m not using it."
2020-07-02 01:46:59,Super Good! Needs Roku Extension!,4,Asdfkjkl;,False,I really like this app! It’s my favorite streaming service I’ve used so far BUT I can’t keep my subscription going unless it’s available on Roku TV. Until then I can’t commit to the service.
2020-06-29 06:23:47,Won’t work right with AirPlay,1,Cowboy 27456,True,"Keeps say that it cannot play the video on Airplay and that I am not connected to the internet yet all other apps and internet videos work flawlessly. HBO needs to fix their app now.

Did everything they suggested and still will not work correctly. Subscription is being cancelled, waste of money!"
2020-06-15 02:46:21,Will not allow me to login,1,Purrsizt,False,"Every time I try to login it asks me who’s watching and then it takes me back to a screen that says subscribe or link my subscription. I’m tired of reaching out for help to login. Also, not available on Firestick, Roku or my tv,  so I have to watch on my phone or computer. That wouldn’t bother me so much if I was actually capable of logging in. 🤬"
2020-06-14 23:05:03,Needs major improvements in UI,2,xcaptainxma,False,"To browse different episodes or swipe between seasons is challenging. Also, the browsing slows down when rewind or forward pressed.

I hope these two improvements soon especially with switching episodes and seasons."
2020-05-28 13:49:04,Make it available for everyone who paid for it.,1,Ajjfoowbabbdje$&&:)/(-,False,I purchased a subscription months ago only to find out I can’t watch it on my roku TVs. Fortunately I have another device but many people do not so one star is all I’ll give. The app itself has worked great and has great content but that doesn’t matter if everyone can’t enjoy.
2020-05-28 00:29:17,No mobile provider login In,1,Mrjsm,False,Downloaded the app and found to be very disappointed that when I try to log in there is no option for mobile provider since that is were my free subscription is with so can you please add a mobile provider instead of a tv provider only and I will then give you a better review
2020-10-18 23:35:25,Good content. UI is god awful,1,D8736,False,"I’ve worked in software for over 10
Years and I have to say that this HBOMax UI is the single worst app I have ever used. The UX is infuriating and it’s clear that HBO either contracted this to a crap software company or took their worst employees and put them in charge of this... complete lack of care.

Did no one test this thing before launching it?"
2020-10-05 20:52:27,Really disappointed!,1,Boot dog,False,"Let’s be honest they made it sound like they were going to have have everything Warner Media had on this streaming. Turns out it pretty much the same thing as HBO GO. If they were to put everything that Warner Media had on it would keep it, but it was it has maybe 10%."
2020-09-14 09:33:32,Great but...,5,MadSpit,False,Great streaming service only thing that stinks is that it’s not available on Roku they need to change that quickly.
2020-08-27 18:30:15,Movie I was in the middle of watching just disappeared from search,1,pandaluvr4ever,False,I had to reboot my iPad due to network issues and wanted to continue watching the 2nd movie in a series. I cannot even locate it in search anymore. I can find the first and last one in the trilogy in search but not the 2nd one. This is a really bad user experience.
2020-08-12 23:53:18,Does not work offline,2,Ryan Sigesmund,False,"I downloaded shows to watch while being offline and within a couple of days the app stopped working. So, I had to commute to someplace with internet to re-authenticate the app. I’ll change this review when this is fixed."
2020-08-08 00:27:32,Useless,1,100010,True,"Update: Unhelpful response from the developers. Product still doesn’t work.

Doesn’t work with my Roku anymore and I dislike going through my cable service to attempt to sift through. HBO has always been pricy, now it’s just a pointless subscription. Don’t bother unless you only like watching things on your phone."
2020-07-22 04:45:25,Buggy with airplay,1,dinked?,False,"When I try to airplay hbo from my iPhone to iMac, only the audio will play with no video. All other apps work flawlessly with airplay videos. I don’t know what’s wrong but will definitely be unsubscribing due to this issue. Please fix. When I airplay using QuickTime no video shows, audio plays with a black screen. Fix this you morons."
2020-07-19 20:59:50,Seriously! How can u give less than 5 stars?,5,JoeyBones621,False,"Im reading all of these reviews and I am shock! When Disney+ first came out it was terrible to find stuff. Disney+ improved!

HBOMAX has like everything non-disney. Scoobydoo, flintstones, looney toons, DC movies, great movie selections and tv show selections.  

I do wish they would load all of the old looney toons on there but i can wait. Theres so much to watch i am so excited.

Worth it!"
2020-07-13 03:41:05,Terrible Subtitles if mirroring to TV. Deal Breaker.,2,Jim NY,False,"No app for LG TV! Almost deal-breaker.  Very difficult to Mirror to LG TV,  but ultimately doable. However, subtitles horrific! infinitesimal   and worse yet, all over the TV screen. Suddenly top left corner to right lower corner In the middle of a sentence! Amazingly stupid.

Who wants to watch a 2 hour movie on a tiny iPhone instead of a 65"" TV?"
2020-06-25 02:39:14,Not up to date.,3,XmasElf084,False,"The app is ok, with great content. But when I log onto it on a console it has way more content. The mobile app doesn’t have joker, and is missing category’s on the side menu. Please update the app to include all the content."
2020-06-11 16:47:57,Offline viewing not working,2,Last Week iPhone Newbie,False,"I downloaded shows to watch offline. I have the cellular settings turned off to ensure I don’t use cellular data to stream. As soon as I open the app, a message showing, “Can’t Connect” appears and I cannot do anything else except close the app."
2020-06-19 23:39:29,Rockstart app!,5,Castalia8,False,"HBO MAX has an endless gallery of movies, TV shows, Max originals and many more. It is pretty straight forward to use and I can stream in my phone, tablet and TVs. Thank you!!"
2020-06-09 19:11:24,APP NEEDS WORK!!!,3,rjamisonl,False,I downloaded a few shows but the app doesn’t recognize it as being downloaded and you have to stream anyway. The resume feature doesn’t work very well. It says resume but restarts the programming anyway.
2020-05-29 17:21:59,Movies restart a beginning after closing app,3,Jesse4J,False,Would be great if you could pause movie and return to it without having to try and fast forward to spot where you left off.
2020-06-05 11:59:23,Can’t sign in thru AT&T provider,1,RV Harvey,False,"My AT&T mobile plan includes HBO Max. Cannot sign in on either iPad or iPhone. Called AT&T, they confirmed I have a subscription but after 1.5 hours on the phone no one can get it to work. Just stuck in a loop trying to sign in. Many users have a similar complaint 
The worst thing that ever happened to HBO was being purchased by AT&T."
2020-06-03 01:19:28,Caption settings,5,bcar00,False,"Captions appear on the top and font is too big. Covers half the screen. Other than that great app.
Fixed"
2020-05-31 09:40:17,They really make it seem like they have everything when they don’t,1,daniarmani187765,False,"They don’t offer a lot of good content and as of June 2020 no amazing original tv shows or movies I don’t think this app was ready for release it’s not available on a lot of platforms like Fire tv and smart tv it’s just Very empty and needs more variety, shows movies and originals"
2020-05-30 22:47:29,Challenging to access,1,patrickchristian,False,"With the switch from HBO Now to Max, the experience is very disjointed. Apple TV offers to sign in with a provider, but then says to go to a website or download an app. Download an app, to sign in via provider, only to find the subscription is not supported. What a waste- why not allow me to access on the tv, or at least a website."
2020-05-30 00:12:35,Was Really Excited to Watch Friends Again,1,Nesamayonesa,False,"I downloaded this app just for a handful of shows, mainly Friends, and I’m sincerely disappointed. The app constantly shuts down, says episodes are “unavailable” and isn’t even available for download on my Firestick so I have to “AirPlay” it to my TV which hosts its own problems. Overall just upset the app doesn’t work."
2020-05-28 04:13:21,So so,3,mosando,False,"I honestly thought it would have more content from CN,CR, TCM oh and some Cinemax series on there like Banshee but a las no. But my major gripe is the lack of Spanish subtitles, the Latino selection is limited and not having subs on the other shows and movies is honestly kinda sad to see from Warner."
2020-07-20 01:32:18,"Content is great, but app is glitchy",3,AATKAA,False,"I cannot get the shows/movies to play because the live area to simply click “play” does not work for me. It has always worked on the other HBO apps, so I’m unsure why it’s not working on this own!"
2020-05-27 22:45:29,Underwhelming and disappointing,2,peev34,False,"Yes, it is an improvement over HBO NOW, but there is a ton of missing content across the various hubs it offers, namely DC, Cartoon Network, and Crunchyroll. And so many movies I expected across WBs massive platform. Disney+ this is not. Not even close. In its current state, I don’t see myself staying with it past the first month."
2020-05-27 22:24:57,Best streaming service that has everything,5,Trey102,False,"HBO Max is by far the best streaming service there is. Watching all of the classic CN shows and my favorite show Summer Camp Island, this platform is for everybody"

2020-10-01 18:13:01,HBO Max app,1,Fracky94,False,"Really good shows but a bad streaming app. Plays videos when it wants to, some shows have no sound and really slow. HBO please work on this I haven’t been able to watch a show in the past you two days. Mostly every day I have to reset my Samsung tv and re-download your app that sometimes helps to get sound back."
2020-09-27 14:13:40,Hardly any content to choose from of any streaming service,1,Wilesd1980,False,"They have the least amount of any streaming service. Only reason I have it, is it offered free in my AT&T unlimited package. Or I wouldn’t pay for the trash streaming service. Disney has more, which they are really lacking. You can arrived very late, and threw trash up to get going."
2020-09-04 07:17:16,Some Problems,4,jaloza13,False,The app is great but whenever I try to log in thru a browser I always get a error page. Nothing on help HBO Max is helping.(It is a mac from 2015 fully updated.)
2020-08-18 15:57:33,Can’t Download Movies & not compatible with Apple TV,1,Dylan.tkd,True,"Every time i leave the app while I’m waiting for the download, it stops the download and I have to start it over. Once i finally got one to download (by leaving my phone on and on the app for like 3 hours which is ridiculous) I couldn't stream it on Apple TV so I wasted my time downloading it anyways."
2020-08-08 15:46:37,HBO IS OVERPRICED,4,sanchezmia,False,"Netflix is about the same price but it has way more content and the all is way better with different languages, fast interface and skip intros . 
But I love hbo they got good series but not too much"
2020-07-30 01:40:44,At least 4 stars if app had auto-play,1,danhatt,False,I really like the programing and being able to Chomecast to TV. App works as expected except auto-play cannot be disabled. I do not understand is why there is no option to turn off autoplay. Other similar services and apps provide an option to turn off auto-play.
2020-07-04 05:50:39,I’d Like to Have HBO NOW Again.,3,iamcarmalia,False,"I miss things about the old app, like the “Collections” category. Also, HBO MAX simply has more offerings than I need. It’s a lot to sift through. I appreciated being able to get right to the quality offerings of HBO NOW. Can I change it back?"
2020-07-01 03:37:47,Needs work,3,Sims4lover123,False,"The app is not that bad I’ll say but it needs work. The CC need to be more subtle, it’s all over the place. The last thing i think the app needs is a skip intro, I don’t want to see the same intro over and over again."
2020-10-09 06:34:36,Good content but bad streaming,3,schoolbored,False,I like the content because  is the stuff I don’t see in any other streaming app. My main problem with this app is that I could only watch movies or shows when it’s not LTE
2020-06-27 03:04:45,Missing HBO Now,1,EliCla,False,"It used to be with HBO now (what I subscribe to)that if a movie or a show appeared as an option, I would just click on it and watch. Now I get all these possibilities of viewing options that require that I upgrade my service to view. I just want a list of what’s available and nothing else…

Also, the app on my Apple TV is a clunky mess."
2020-06-20 17:04:08,Limited availability - please add to Roku,1,rae98748695873,False,"My cell phone plan offer Now included for free, which would be cool but as it’s not available on Roku (one of, if not the most common steaming device) - it’s basically worthless to me. 

I’m also honestly too confused by the Now/Go/Max setup. Is it really necessary to have so many different platforms? Please HBO, simplify and increase ease of access."
2020-06-18 04:32:17,This app is goated,5,eurididu,False,This is automatically goated they got every single show accept for one idc y’all tweaking this streaming is raw for FREE! Y’all must off the pack or sum cuz.y’all tweaking writing one star! 🚫🧢

I have my login information and your app keeps telling me it cannot verify me. This is through At&t. I even reset my password and called at&t support to make sure it’s not a mistake and I am eligible for the service. Not a good first impression.
2020-06-14 23:10:02,App is not accessible,1,callucin,False,"Said thanks, but no thanks to HBO max email invitation for a free trial. The app is not accessible using a screen reader and none of the programming has audio description. Shame. Because, when I was fully cited, HBO was my favorite network. However, until the app is accessible and programming has audio description, HBO will not be getting any of my disposable income."
2020-05-30 01:28:02,Loading and App Issues,1,AnaCabana6,False,"Text from my cell provider saying I could get it as part of my package. Says sign in with provider. Loading issues galore, didn’t let me sign in with my provider, had to sign up as a new user. Turns out Do Not Sell my Privacy note was defaulted to off... and then the UI is terrible! Is this really what all the hype was about?"
2020-05-28 07:01:32,Spectacular! Amazing! Great! Beautiful!,5,alex cantuu,False,Top of the line streaming service. So much content it’s actually overwhelming. I’ve never been in awe with a streaming service until now. HBO Max is in opinion THE BEST!!!!
2020-05-27 23:07:50,Its a awesome apps but it need other language,4,omar621,False,Its almost perfect but it need spanish lenguage or subtitle to be on the top then I give you a 5 star... I hope they can change this very soon as they can
2020-05-27 22:29:12,HBO Max off to a great start,5,TheManAE,False,"The app is smooth and intuitive. Don’t get me started on the content, all my favorite shows and movies. Classics and original series!!"
2020-05-27 19:41:12,"Awesome App, Hope we get AEW on here soon",5,CosbysFavoriteSweater,False,"The app has a huge variety of shows and movies to watch, currently binging the Spawn TV series. It deserves five stars for the Watchmen show alone. Hope to one day see AEW PPVs on here!"
2020-05-27 12:20:41,First review!,5,damianc89,False,"Pretty good selection of new stuff, although it was just a merging of the hbo app. Adding of dc and wb catalog is a nice addition. Plus all the Nightmare on Elm streets are on there.  Can’t wait for more to be added."
2020-07-26 13:49:51,Downloading movies and shows,3,NYCitysteve,False,When you download something you still need data to watch what you have downloaded which defeats the whole purpose of downloading something.
2020-10-04 03:36:34,Former HBO subscriber - this is painful,1,Crøwley,False,"I subscribed to HBO for a long time, including the GoT years. I’m trying to access HBO Max on my TV and it has been an absolute disaster. It keeps asking me for a Samsung payment system. I use Apple Pay and Airplay. My fiancé uses Samsung and tried her phone (which goes to her card so she’s not happy) and that doesn’t work either. It’s an absolute mess."
2020-09-20 14:01:08,Doesn’t work with the Apple AV adapter anymore,1,Southkonalopaka,False,"I really enjoyed watching HBO Max while traveling in my RV. But since the last update, my adapter no longer works. I’ve been trying to get a answer why for two weeks now from HBO Max but they are of zero help. I call and they say one of their specialists will contact you, but they don’t. I expected more from HBO Max."
2020-08-05 11:14:09,Continued problems,1,saxman2004,False,"This app is terrible. It continues to log me out and requires me to verify my subscription. I’m eligible through AT&T but it is constantly unable to verify my validity. Then when I finally get it to work, it works for a few days and then I have to troubleshoot all over again. Terrible interface by far. Fix this *^%#."
2020-07-15 12:42:41,Great content but app has major issues,3,shinde04,False,"1. Cannot add default play mode like chrome cast or airplay 
2. Cannot autoplay on AirPlay. System resets after end of the episode and need to disconnect and reconnect airplay to continue playing.
3. Wish there was an app on the TV store"
2020-07-25 00:20:18,Please design a better app!,2,Hfhfvfucpebdhc,False,Shows sometimes cannot be condensed down into a mini player... while in the middle of watching a show there is no way to see how many episodes of that show are available... can’t you just copy the netflix app? ;-)
2020-07-05 23:27:14,A lot of bugs,2,NHJAB,False,The streaming stops way too often and I know it’s not my internet because everything else streams fine. HBO NOW was great never had an issue but this new app is making me think twice about renewing. And also the chrome cast icon disappears all the time.
2020-07-07 07:05:21,HBOMAX Content,5,yourstruly_,False,"I love the DC content, it’s by far my favorite! Please keep on adding more contact on this particular section. It’d be really nice to have all the animated and live action movies on here!"
2020-06-08 14:54:17,Ehhh,3,killswitch022,False,"It’s great to be able to download the shows I used to be able to download from Prime, sopranos, generation kill, band of brothers, etc. the problem is that app is clunky and buggy and not very intuitive. They could learn a lesson or 5 from Netflix, prime, Disney"
2020-06-25 00:43:24,Had to delete,1,Sa blah,False,I had an HBO Now account until a few minutes ago. The fact that you’re forcing customers to create a whole new HBO account and download a new App and not have that easily transferable is alarming in this day and age and for such a large company. It’s  basic customer satisfaction. Keep up with your competition. Sashay away!
2020-06-25 00:36:40,Still crap,1,kfp72,True,This is my second time reviewing this crappy app. Although I like the content I just wish I could watch a show or movie without it freezing up. Please update the app again and fix it this time! Since HBO is fighting with Dish Network this is the only way I can watch my shows. But too many infuriating glitches
2020-06-24 04:08:15,HBO Now not supported???,1,KaySea85,False,"I’ve been a long time HBO Now subscriber (started just to watch Game of Thrones but then kept my subscription and stayed loyal to the service in between seasons and after it ended), and yet now that they debut their new Max subscription they “update” the app to the Max app and leave their loyal Now subscribers in the dust? Thanks for the middle finger, HBO, you’ve lost yourself a customer."
2020-06-22 07:32:24,Stupid,1,Mamajess503,False,Are use a Roku device I downloaded the HBO app on my Roku I pay a monthly fee for it and yet there is no app on my Apple iPad where I can stream HBO neither one of the HBO now or HBO max apps work to watch the HBO that I pay for on it. I stream more for my tablet than I do my TV as I am away from the home a lot. Think I’m going to cancel my HBO altogether. The HBO app used to work but no longer not Roku friendly.
2020-05-28 14:59:11,Great app but has a major glitch!,3,DoctorWho13regenerations,False,"Overall great selection of shows, but I was watching the Doctor Who episode Hell bent and the characters were speaking in Spanish. Please fix immediately. This could be affecting other shows too."
2020-06-01 04:34:00,this app is a disgrace,1,epsiiiiiiiii,False,"You pause a show, come back later, it starts from the begining...
You download a show, you watch it, it has “connection” issues ...
I started an HBO trial and on the first episode of the first show I tried to watch I can say I am cancelling it and never coming back to HBO.
A netword that produces this piece of crap as software does not deserve a cent from me."
2020-05-30 12:23:48,Nothing special!,2,tblehr81,False,"There’s definitely nothing ground breaking here. I believe they spent more time and money on the commercial for HBO Max than the actual service. I have it “free” through Xfinity, otherwise I wouldn’t pay for it. I already have a multitude of other streaming services to numb me out."
2020-05-29 02:00:11,needs spanish dubs,1,Struthionidae,False,"Netflix, disney+, and apple tv all have extensive language support.  When i used to get hbo through a cable provider almost all the hbo shows had spanish dubbing and subtitles. There seems to be no way to stream hbo shows with spanish dubbing.  Very, very disappointed. Give me spanish dubs of the hbo shows and I will be happy to pay 15$ per month."
2020-08-02 00:06:59,"Great App, works only when it wants",3,hapnn7,False,"I love the selection on this app! But I can’t ever seem to get it to stream for long periods of time to Tv through HDMI. It just buffers forever. 
I would love this app if the functionality of it were improved."
2020-10-07 05:25:11,works very poorly on Chromecast,1,127952136942257,False,"Love HBO but it doesn’t stream properly on Chromecast via iPhone — buffers all the time, can’t skip intro theme music, closed captions are in and out,and usually have no way to fast forward, pause, or rewind because the app loses your place in shows. I don’t have any of these issues with other streaming apps, only HBO."
2020-10-06 12:19:07,Can’t Connect or Airplay,1,ParmentierOX,False,"I’ve had this app for less than 48 hours and it has been giving me a “can’t connect” error message for the past 12 hours. I’m also not a fan of how I can’t airplay to my TV while using this app. Not a great first impression. I’m paying for my HBO subscription, please let me watch when and how I’d like to."
2020-09-14 09:28:21,"Good shows, terrible app",2,Jackie_sunshine,False,"Yes you have a ton of crap that I want to watch, but that can only happen if I get the dang app to work. It’s sloppy and struggles insanely hard (especially on the PS4) I’m hoping that since it seems to be down right now we’ll get some better interfacing with an update."
2020-08-26 13:36:49,Upset,1,Chaz9977,False,I am a uverse customer and pay for HBO service through them. I used to really enjoy HBO GO to watch many of your shows especially since the offerings provided with on demand are so limited. Now you have eliminated that and are charging for hbo max I have decided to call uverse and drop HBO. By the way I’ve had HBO for over 20 years. Way to go!
2020-08-23 03:37:17,Disappointed,1,NayaAbb,False,I love the movie collection but I am having so many issues with the app. The movies take forever to load and many times the movie played without sound. I have good internet connection and I am streaming on a Samsung 4k UHD smart TV. It’s the only app I have issues with and I only hope they would do better
2020-08-17 04:48:49,Airplane Mode Problems,2,Addicting and awesome!,False,"The shows are awesome but the app has some serious issues.  It won’t play movies on airplane mode. Downloaded several movies for a plane ride and only ONE worked.  Not impressed. If it’s not that, then it pops an error message stating to close the app and restart again."
2020-08-13 07:47:21,No Roku app?,2,DennySF415,False,"Until a Roku app finally comes along, I find the HBO Max app pretty pointless. I don't watch shows and movies on my phone--talk about neck and eye strain! If an app for Roku isn't forthcoming, I'm canceling my subscription. I get enough quality shows through Netflix. Get with the  program folks! Nobody got time for this."
2020-08-13 02:54:35,Don’t waste your time,1,Valerie Florioma,False,"Literally. This may be the streaming app with the absolute worst functionality possible. Be prepared to waste tons of time trying to navigate something as simple as signing on via your TV provider. Imagine paying $16 a month for an app that is continually saying “connectivity issues”, and that’s about what it’s like to have HBO Max."
2020-08-07 02:34:26,CC not working,1,Seperin,False,"I have tried everything; I restarted my ipad/app, updated ios into the newest version, and turned on the cc menu in my settings > accessibility. But the CC isn’t working still. It works perfectly with my HP laptop (chrome browser). What’s wrong with this app? What’s the point of having CC menu if it isn’t working???"
2020-07-22 01:12:50,Why y’all gotta be so difficult?,1,ashleylikestocomplain,False,"1) I can’t login without the internet provider’s login and being a poor millennial during COVID times, I live with my parents and my dad will not share his account information or log into my device with his login info

2) As of July 31st, 2020 the app is no longer supported on Xbox One.

Not a user friendly application 😬"
2020-06-26 20:58:07,Reconnection Problems,3,taliaamacias,False,"I love the shows they have on here but I hate that I have to go back into search for the show I’m currently watching to pick the next episode, also it seems to loose connection a lot!"
2020-07-10 19:38:04,Offline use,2,Michael05512,False,I love the app and content. But there’s the issue of when I download and go to work where I don’t have phone service. It get error codes and can’t access my downloads. When I reconnect I have to sign back in every time. But when I go offline the issuer repeats
2020-07-08 00:38:22,Poor opening,2,uhddbhrsxc,False,"The fact that I can’t watch this on Roku or Fire TV, combined with the poor UI on the web player, makes this a very poor launch for this service. The only thing giving it 2 stars is the amount of content available"
2020-06-30 06:47:38,Love having Friends again but app is annoying,2,beothe,False,"Hard to navigate to other episodes on a series. And you can’t turn off auto play which is really frustrating. I like to fall asleep watching tv, but I hate waking up a full season ahead of where I was."
2020-06-27 05:32:59,"Worked for a week, then stopped.",1,chuckw1011,False,"This app worked for a week, and now it keeps wanting me to sign in over and over again. My AT&T account says it is part of my plan, confirmed by their store representative. However, still won’t let me sign correctly. Absolute useless, and we have tried several devices."
2020-10-03 15:51:42,Turn off auto play,3,This is my name ok?,False,Every other streaming app has this feature. Please an an option to turn off auto play or a sleep timer feature.
2020-06-19 22:40:19,Don’t delete hbo now,2,robert5551212,False,"Hbo now in its infinite wisdom will only play specific shows in surround sound mode. Not an issue unless you use chromecast and want to control volume from your iPhone like i do.  Hbo now let you do ot, hbo max doesn’t, and i cannot see a way to go back.  Big mistake deleting hbo now."
2020-06-16 13:45:44,Won’t accept my ATT Uverse Account,1,Rick:)9999,True,"The list of providers for sign in does not show ATT Uverse. I tried signing in under just ATT, but gets rejected. So won’t work. I’m only able to use HBO Go.

Update: HBO Max sent me a generic response that was not helpful at all. If they read my original review they would understand the problem. I have ATT Uverse and it is not in list of providers to sign in with."
2020-06-13 20:39:13,No fire stick support,2,Ajolsen28,False,"What’s a tv service worth if it doesn’t work on my streaming device. Answer: not a thing. 

Guys this is simple. HBO Now worked on Firestick. HBO Max should as well. Whatever argument you have you need to resolve. Because I’m not paying $15 a month to watch this on my phone."
2020-06-12 21:16:17,The app is crap,1,Bwh8,False,"It can not load all the movie thumbnails. When you scroll down several times then the thumbnails stops loading. The search input is ridiculous, does not allow voice search. Extremely bad when using it on appletv. Slow and sometimes it crashes"
2020-06-07 17:41:51,Can’t watch it....,2,Tukukashi,False,"I have the app on my iPad, but because I pay through roku, I cannot watch it. Because “my provider isn’t supported.” I would love to watch it, I have had hbo now for a while and liked it. So as soon as I can watch it, I’ll most likely be happy. So I’ll give it 2 stars for now."
2020-05-30 08:30:14,Let down// SUBTITLES DONT SHOW,2,Mariosaurus_,False,"Theres NOT alot. Ive seen much of this stuff except for a few things. 
Also subtitles are missing? On my mobile device. I was lead to believe this app would be amazing and next best thing and I’ve been left short handed. Yall need to add more cartoons/stuff /original content to it or something"
2020-05-29 05:14:36,Not worth the money,1,makaela11,False,Why is there not hbo max on fire sticks and rocu witch covers about 70% of the worlds steaming devises its mainly only for mobile devises. Small screens that cover about 1/100 of my tv this is the worst streaming app I’ve seen the only reason I’m keeping it is because it’s the only streaming app with the show friends other than that I don’t suggest this app.
2020-05-28 03:46:09,Geographical Restriction,4,LelettSetik,False,"I’ve always loved HBO. I can’t, however, use it whenever I travel outside of US. Hopefully this new feature allows me to continue using the app even outside of US."
2020-10-15 03:38:31,"UI, functionality, and login are terrible",1,Overcast Fan,False,"UI makes it difficult to navigate between content and to pause, play, skip, etc. If I’m in the middle of a show, no I don’t want to scroll to see what else is available to watch, I want a big set of pause/skip buttons

No option to skip recap or theme song at beginning of shows

Tried a bazillion times to login to no avail. I knew I was using the right login — it worked on other devices. I had to change my password.

Not a good combo. Switching back to a web application and an HDMI cord to the TV instead of this crap 😑"
2020-10-10 00:55:26,Promo rate defaulted to full price early,2,AlejandroCruz365,False,I had to cancel because our promo rate defaulted back to the full price after someone selected restore purchase on a new device. We tried contacting Apple and HBO and nobody will get back to us so we’ll just had to cancel. Maybe next time.
2020-09-22 01:44:51,Disappointed,2,Laugh out loud lol,False,"Love all the shows, hate the app.  Super glitchy.  The only way to watch it on my TV is with Chromecast and it never finds the signal.  Not an issue with the Chromecast because all the other apps find it no problem.  What a hassle!!  Might as well delete it. :("
2020-09-24 22:43:09,This app isn’t accessible,1,abbyg32,False,"I’ve heard great things about this app, and the amazing selection of movies and shows on it. However, I am blind and use a screen reader to navigate my phone, and this app doesn’t work with my screen reader. So I cannot browse. This is very disappointing and I hope that the developers fix it."
2020-08-18 03:30:09,Great Content but awful quality,2,MBlaze76,False,"I would love to love this app but the quality is just awful. Constant pixelation, streaming always buffering and error messages when the streaming can’t go anymore. I’m using this on a Apple TV 4K with 1GB speed internet so it’s not my connection."
2020-08-14 15:25:40,Download and transfer to usb,5,aytekin.123,False,Please do something that we can download and transfer it to pc or hard or usb
2020-06-15 08:33:30,Need auto play option,3,Hockey9214,False,Nothing like falling asleep and waking up with your phone dead because it played HBO for 6 hours and burned 2.2 gigs of data. There needs to be an option to turn off auto play.
2020-08-07 02:59:33,What is HBO Max?,1,Poobla54,True,"My app auto updated and now I can’t watch anything. What am I paying money for?

Update 1: Was contacted by the developer. I guess they don’t understand the problem. Was told to reinstall the app. The problem is I’m paying for HBO Now. A service that exists on Roku, but not on iPhone. Just give me back the now app. Until then this app is useless."
2020-08-05 21:51:00,You guys really need to look at what other streaming apps provide for their customers,2,Sandman845,False,What’s the purpose of having an option to download content when you need WiFi or data in order to access said downloads
2020-08-02 21:58:20,Greed and stupidity,1,ElwoodBlues,False,"If you download a show so that you can watch it when you don’t have internet, you’ll find that it won’t matter. The app won’t even start up if you don’t have internet. Very frustrating. I’ll be cancelling...

Go with Netflix. They actually let you watch the stuff you download for offline use."
2020-07-04 17:14:18,LOVE IT...,5,uncorn lover,False,I have been looking for the buddies series and I finally found it on this app. They also have other great films! I 100% recommend!
2020-05-27 18:46:19,"Missing feedback, search options",3,hbo-fan,False,"Fast and pretty clean.  App needs feedback option and better search than just by title (eg, ability to search and sort by year released)"
2020-05-28 16:41:45,Great library of shows and movies,4,IEatGlue36,False,HBO max has an amazing library of shows and movies. The only thing I would change is make it accessible on fire stick and rlly tv’s
2020-05-28 03:21:11,Awesome.,5,SandzBhajee,False,"Even though expensive than other streaming services, but still worth to pay fir rich contents lib."
2020-05-28 02:14:15,"Sound keeps going out, app keeps crashing",1,breebreeisme,False,Having a hard time keeping the app open it keeps crashing then when it does play within 8 minutes of the movie the sound goes out. I repeatedly closed the app to still no sound on the movie hopefully it gets better with time
2020-05-28 01:31:19,Glitches,1,Jellybeanzbrain101,False,"Content for doctor who ever other episode is in Spanish . No way to correct it. Apple 4K, XR cellphones. Anything new. Called customer support. They act like they were not aware have no way to report it. Glad this is just a trial. For all the rest complaining about This not being available. Don’t know why your in an Apple forum complaining."
2020-10-12 04:21:33,Navigation is horrible,3,Aidan F,False,Navigation is horrible and easy to learn. Why would you press on a textual header to go back to a list? It seems like this was made without any actual UX designers in the room.
2020-05-27 11:42:25,Doctor Who Marathon!!,5,tubblewubble,False,I got this app just for Doctor Who but then i saw a bunch of other things i want to watch!! I just wish they would put the app on roku.
2020-10-07 17:54:20,Downloaded content fails to play without an internet connection?,2,tvs_stephen_colbert,False,The content on HBO max is great but the app doesn’t work well. The most frustrating thing is that downloaded content frequently fails during playback and returns an error.
2020-09-04 04:45:46,Signing in,2,sttinkod,False,I’ve been trying to sign in with my email and password and it still says they are having issues I love having to wait for over an hour and I’ve been just wanting to watch the shows and movies on it
2020-09-03 04:21:18,DONT PAY $15/month for this,2,Lil' miss hotty,False,"This is kinda a crappy service. I wouldn’t pay $3 for this. You can’t get it on Roku TVs, they remove movies out of the blue, you have to be connected to wifi to watch, and there’s barely any good shows. Just get Netflix and save yourself $7 a month."
2020-06-22 18:11:41,GET THIS ON ROKU!,2,Wilson (the volley ball),False,"I have been waiting ever since this launched for HBO Max to be on Roku and it hasn’t happened! I want to be able to play Sesame Street for my baby sibling and Max is never there when I want it the most! The library is great but, it doesn’t matter if I can’t watch it on most of my streaming devices."
2020-06-25 22:30:50,HBO max,5,sadiedaj,False,This is the best app I’ve ever had in my entire life. This app has everything I want to watch like it is unbelievable. I’m loving this app this app gives me life. 😁
2020-06-25 04:33:41,Junk,1,emilyvvdmcxg,False,I am so upset Comedy Central switched to this. I would give it negative stars if possible. You have to download the episodes you want to watch and then still it wouldn’t play. No streaming. The option to watch on tv with chromecast didn’t work. Doesn’t even give an option to work with firestick. Just a garbage app
2020-06-20 22:45:16,Very disappointing,2,Joey2554,False,"I don’t appreciate you advertising your ad-FREE streaming service when you give me ads based off of HBO products. I want that stuff to be on my recommended not forced for me to look at, with the cost of this service you shouldn’t be forcing these things."
2020-06-19 19:45:16,Shows are good but...,2,Chicana807,False,I love the new shows but as a Roku user I am still sad I cannot use this on my tv. I understand they didn’t sign a contract together but recently I’ve been using hbo now on my Roku and it won’t let me see anything or it will say your session is up. Very disappointed.
2020-06-15 20:38:31,Missing 4K,3,DWhit45,False,"I like the new HBO Max service, but how is it 2020 and it doesn’t even offer 4K content. At the price of the service which has 4K (3x the cost of its cheapest competitor which does) it should definitely offer the premium streaming quality."
2020-06-19 01:16:06,Airplay ALWAYS glitchy,2,Martian with a tutu,False,"I love everything this app has to offer, but my only problem is that when I try to airplay to my TV it only works once in a while and when it does work it episodes do not continuously play. Extremely frustrating!!!"
2020-06-11 11:06:02,Too many problems,3,静心斋主great,False,"First of all your app has problem to display subtitles on my iPhone XS Max ,I have tried many times but ended in vain.
The second problem is your app reacts too slow and dull.
Please tackle them soon."
2020-06-12 00:34:47,Waste. Of. Time. And. Money.,1,ED Wrestling,False,"The title says it all. To avoid the glitches , or so we thought, we would download the episodes of the show we wanted to watch. I guess the joke is on us. Downloads don’t play half the time. In fact, most of the time. What a horrible app. I would give it a negative rating if such a thing was possible."
2020-07-11 01:13:54,My experience with hbo max,3,metalheadjoshie,False,"When I was watching the first episode of Close Enough the audio is being delayed at least by a second off, like it’s not in sync with the show."
2020-06-11 06:31:52,The noise level,2,zombie_8_brains,True,I was excited that hbo max would have studio ghibli but once I clicked the movie the background music was just too loud and could barely hear the characters speaking. I have tried my best to change that but it did not work. Ruined my watching experience.
2020-05-27 15:05:30,no roku,2,mariahmartel,False,"i will not be renewing my subscription until there is an app available on roku. every TV in my house is a roku, so i have no way of watching anything on here unless i watch on my phone (which i hate, why should i have to watch stuff i pay for on a tiny screen??)"

I don’t have a problem with the commercials since I knew it would happen due to the offer price. What I don’t like is the same commercials over and over again. It seems like when watching a program with several episodes, there is a repetition of ads which is, quite honestly, not going to get me out there for those products. 
There are a few older dramas (and probably sitcoms that aren’t already in syndication) that I would like to watch, namely “Cold Case,” “Boston Public,” “Falcon Crest,” and “Picket Fences.” I’m sure that there are more, but I cannot come up with them at this time.

OMG! you’d think you would want to make your new subscribers experience the best.. again you should make it easier to upgrade or start everyone out with the BEST plan first.. and then give them the option to switch once the free trial ends.. just saying.. i don’t plan to cancel right away.. i guess i’ll leave it on during the free trial and use the app if i’m that desperate to watch an episode i’m willing to sit thru the same ads over and over every few minutes while trying to get thru an episode. best believe my subscription will be cancelled as soon as the trial is up! so disappointing! ugh!
2020-04-01 06:48:18,Never ending issues,2,_tinydancer_,False,"You would think for app with this many subscribers and this high of a subscription rate (for the live tv) the least they could do is make an app that works.

The app has near constant glitches. It often plays the audio of one show while a completely different show plays. It never remembers where you left off in a show so you have to watch the same commercial breaks again. It freezes, it crashes. It has the worst UI. You can’t set shows that you’ve recorded to automatically delete after you’ve watched them so you have to do it manually. Even when you record shows, you can only fast forward through the commercials maybe 25% of the time. One show I record never records the whole episode. Even after I delete it, it stays this way. Then miraculously, after a week, the full episode appears. Seems like this app is perpetually a year behind it’s competitors. 

I really hope someone reads this and looks into all these perpetual issues, but I’m not holding my breath. Get it together. You owe your paying customers more than this."
2020-03-28 03:19:40,Could be way better,2,Poshafied!,False,"At first I loved this app then after using it for a awhile I found all the glitches. The time it takes to download a movie and all the buffering makes it difficult to even watch a show or a movie. I pay the extra for no commercials but by the time it buffers 25 times through the movie or show.... I give up. It never used to do this so much but now it’s all the time. I go to the other competition movie app and it doesn’t do it on that app so I know it’s not my internet. Did you get rid of someone that knew what they were doing tech wise??? Also they used to change the movie choices more often and have newer movies, even better that the competition, but now the movies are always the same and all OLD movies and horror film it’s boring and sickening. There used to be more choices, what about PBS, what about getting up to date history channel. I’d like to see some historical dramas and movies!! I pay my fee each month and I’m barely getting good use out of the app. I Really think I’ll discontinue my subscription."
2020-06-06 04:52:35,"Buffering, Glitches, Selection or Movies and Shows, and ADSS",2,Alise Leonardo,False,"Buffering and Glitches•

The app has a nice selection of shows and tv shows. But it buffers and glitches A LOT!!! This makes it hard and annoying to watch stuff. It took me 20 minutes to get a movie started. I had to constantly restart the app and exit in and out of the app; to stop the glitches. I’ve checked my WiFi and it works perfectly. You would think with the updates it has they would have already fixed the constant buffering, loading, and glitches. It gets to the point where I can’t, don’t, or want to even bother to use the app. 

Selection of Movies and Shows•

Another problem which isn’t that big is the selection of Movies and Shows. Don’t get me wrong it has an “okay” selection but they don’t update it that much. They don’t have much of the movies or shows I’m looking for. A lot of the shows they have aren’t that popular. I find it hard to not rewatch most of the same stuff. I’ve had this app for a year now and have watched mostly everything I’m interested in. 

Commercials•

The commercials and constant ads in the app make me go CRAZY. There are so many commercials. I just want to watch something without commercials every 10-15 minutes.

With all this I recommend Netflix or another app to watch stuff. But if you are looking for a specific show that is anti popular this app probably has it. The app has issues where it gets to the point you don’t want to use it."

You will have to cancel your subscription and wait for its termination date - one month later. I didn’t think I minded having ads and then it hits you with these gross 70 second ads. I can’t watch those every 5-8 minutes when I’m just trying to enjoy a show. So I tried to change to the Hulu(no ads) plan but it won’t let me until my old plan terminates. So I tried making another account. Didn’t work; it recognizes that you have another account and says, “would you like to sign in with this one?”. When you hit no it doesn’t go through with the new account and if you hit yes, you weren’t making a new account to begin with. I’ve had this app for maybe an hour and already a huge turnoff. 3/5: the video quality was good in the 5-8 minutes I could stand watching. But most everything else is maddening."

Very disappointed with the customer inference & the interaction I have had with it so far. The way the system works causes strain which SHOULD NOT BE HAPPENING. I am a very tech savvy person too. But this app makes it 10x more strenuous to operate. Using this app opposed to others is a terrible experience.. The only reason I continue paying for this is because the content is great. I am very disappointed with the customer interface being a new customer. Its 2020, hope you know how to fix it. Sheesh. I’ll be sure to be talking to my friend about this too.

There are tons of shows to watch of many different genres Cartoons, Dramas, Action, Comedy and so much more. I’m sorry if you didn’t choose the right plan. There have been no troubles for me except one thing for kids I find it annoying that you can’t select a age until  13 my 10 year old can only watch shows for little kids and has been begging me to let her have TV-14 but that has inappropriate content for her. So please please make you be able to do different age ratings for kids under 13 such as TV-Y, TV-Y7, TV-G, and TV-PG. I find this a problem because my daughter can only watch kid shows. I also caught my 4 year old watching sailor moon and I am positive this is not age appropriate for her.

I can’t find it anyway err on even the shows and movies it states has it, and when I go to the website to change it like it says I should it just gives me a description of what the feature is supposed to do instead of activating it.
	On this note, there is no way to find your continue watching. Where you can usually find shows and movies you have left off on other apps, this doesn’t have one, and if it does it need to be more easily accessible, even for beginners.
	It also didn’t save any of my shows/movies I clicked on that I’m interested in watching. Their “My Stuff” which I woul assume to be like Netflix’s “My LIst” only saved two of my shows I clicked on out of my eleven and one of my movies out of the eight.

2020-09-04 15:05:59,Several Problems,2,Queen1sa,False,"My biggest issue with the app is that certain episodes won’t download. For example, episodes 1-3 of a show might download then 4 will refuse to. For someone who relies primarily on downloads, this is a pain. Also, some episodes are missing entirely from certain shows. This may just be a copyright issue, but with all the other issues this app has, you never know. More recently, I’ve been having a problem where episodes I’ve downloaded won’t play. I end up having to close the app and open it again just to make the episode play. And often it won’t save my progress if I stop in the middle. Finally, when I try to remove things from My List, some shows won’t leave. It says they’re not in there anymore, but they still appear in the feed. Honestly, the only reason I’m giving this app any stars is that I enjoy the content. I would be much happier, however, if they could fix these problems."

I still do not like how new shows do not always pop up to the front of my queue. There might be a show that I’m just not in the mood to watch and there are a couple of unwatched episodes… And that stays at the top of my queue. That’s fine until something else new or comes along it should bump it down. I was just getting used to the moronic layouts when all of these other things start happening, I thought we’ll maybe it’s because it’s not an updated app. So I cannot hear only time it just update it. Is there no quality assurance checks before and after you get released? Is there no focus group? Is there no research of what other streaming apps are doing and doing well?"
2019-11-28 16:20:49,Commercial overload,3,Retail mobile Detail,False,"I really like the app but two things turn me off about it. The first is that when picking a show they play too many commercials. Once you pick a show they play 90 secs of commercials, then they play the opening credits for your show. Then they play another set of commercials before playing the show. Then they play 2 more sets of commercials during a show that is only 22-25 mins. After the show is over they play another set of commercials before and after closing credits. I know that it is only 90secs but this adds up and makes me disinterested in watching any shows. The other feature I dislike is that when trying to watch “live tv” even when you pick that option they will make you watch the show from the beginning. Then you have to fast forward to live tv, after watching commercials of course....."

But will you please upgrade your servers so your app doesn’t constantly idle and lose connection.

We pay for no commercials but STILL get them ALL the time.  Constantly buffering.  I’m a teacher so I used to use this for documentaries but now whatever you did I no longer can. Don’t even get me started on your ‘Continue Watching’ section!  I have shows I’ve never watched all over it and can never find the shows I ACTUALLY AM WATCHING!  And what the hell is it with eliminating episodes after only watching them once?!  I started watching a series, one was Nancy Drew, the rest of my family wanted to watch the older episodes to catch up and they’re gone! What the hell!  This is a brand new series people!

Also, the ad problem needs to be fixed, it keeps playing the ads, then replaying them. Like it would have the ads run as normal, then replay them for no reason. Also there needs to be an easier way to change plans. Skipping is rather annoying as well because every time I skip forward or back it sends me back to where I was!

It is so annoying to have to exit that list and go back to “my stuff” to watch another episode every single time that I cannot give more than two stars. They’re not even in “my stuff”, and why would anyone want to watch random episodes of different shows one after the other instead of watching consecutive episodes of a show? Who does that? But that’s not even the point. I would rather see the new episodes of the shows in “my stuff” in the “up next” list than a bunch of episodes of random shows. For instance, I see the option of adding individual episodes to a list called “my episodes”, which cannot be accessed anywhere. Basically a blackhole. Why not add the episodes in “my episodes” to “up next” and give users the ability to manage the “my episodes” list? Just a thought..."

The app sometimes whites out (on my home screen the app will be there but the logo disappears and I can’t even load the app by clicking on it). This usually resolves itself after a bit. This is the only app I have that exhibits this behavior. Additionally, if you’re watching a show and lose internet connection, especially during an ad, the episode might start from the beginning when you get back to a good connection. It’s happened to me once and I’ll see if it happens again. 

Other than those two bugs it’s been a pretty smooth experience."

Ah I feel a bit better now we'll back to struggling through your terrible UI which will most likely lead to me cancelling my subscription"
2019-10-22 00:16:14,Newest update causes more problems,1,lpr2012,True,"Update: Down to one star.

- Resume now never works. It always starts the episode back at the start, even on the same device. The thumbnail will show something like 70%, say “Resume,” but tapping will just start at the network logo and you get to scrub to try and find your spot.

- Crashes in the background on TV OS every time it’s launched.

- When you have Live TV with no commercials, about 50% of the time, the system will play the live on-demand version of a show instead of the no commercials version. Killing the app and restarting will re-roll for you.

Update: New regressions. Do you all need help testing basics?

 - If you stop a show mid-stride, coming back to the interface shows the “resume” button and a progress bar at the right place. Tapping resume starts the show over. Happens about 90% of the time on TV and iPhone/iPad apps.

The update again causes more usability bugs.

 - Links from the TV app no longer work again, and watch percentage is no longer updated back. Happens about 20% of the time.

 - Resume function no longer works. Stopping a video and resuming it later on Apple TV causes the video to start at the beginning about 50% of the time. Seems to work fine on iPad and iPhone.

- App crashes when video is paused and the screen saver comes on or the screen locks. Happens about 30% of the time."

I would say it might me my WiFi or data connection but Netflix doesn’t have this issue at all. All ads play perfectly but the content when streaming times out all the time. I pay $5.99 for tv like experience with all this content and the only real experience I’m getting is ads that I’m apparently paying for. I’m ending my subscription because this company puts advertising over quality of streaming which is what I had hoped to pay for. I don’t mind ads here and there. But I don’t want to watch ads every time because the app crashed on the streaming connection with pop up errors because only ads work. The app never crashes during an advertisement. Why is that?

There are four things show up on my keep watching list that I don’t even want. I have to keep removing them, and they track my progress.

The worse part is that it usually crashes right after a commercial break so when I get the app back up and running and resume the episode I have to sit through another minute of the same commercials. 
Simply closing the app after an update does not fix the problem. It requires me to delete the app from my device and reinstall. It’s ridiculously inconvenient and annoying. Please fix this.

The app completely exits from itself in the middle of a show, or the screen would go dark with a loading bar. Only to pop back up rewinding itself 20 seconds, playing then going dark again. Getting stuck in an annoying endless loop. I really like the app but if that is is the kind of service I’m going to keep having, especially paying $45/month.

Update: the previous problem has gone away, but with the new update, I accidentally fast forward my show probably about ten times in each sitting somehow. Its extremely easy to do. I end up watching extra commercials because of this, and then when I try to find my spot again, I have to sit through a second set of commercials if I click multiple times looking for the right scene. It adds a LOT of commercials to my viewing time.

I also have similar concerns to others reviews, as it used to be easy to find my shows and find new things I'd be interested in, but now it's not as intuitive, and it's more difficult to quickly find things."
2020-04-27 17:39:07,Horrible streaming/improved but still issues,3,the amazing flying vega,False,"$15 a month for no commercials. Yet my video stops multiple times to tell me, Sorry, an error has occurred while streaming this video. We apologize for any inconvenience. Yeah thanks. It also doesn't resume videos from all devices. 

Save your money and skip unless you're desperate.

Update: streaming is better now but there are still issues with the app. It’s constantly disconnecting from my phone. It still plays on the tv but I have reconnected to pause etc. other super annoying thing, once you’re show is finished it auto plays suggested shows not in your queue. This is super annoying when it’s a show you don’t want to watch. It used to skip to something in your queue which makes sense. Suggested shows should be somewhere else."
2019-05-04 02:04:43,You Really Need To Let People Take Screenshots,1,Batman Kittyface,False,"Obviously whoever added the feature which makes the screen completely black every time you take a screenshot has little to no experience with the internet. No content pirate has ever thought “ah, yes, i will capture this movie frame by frame and then splice these frames together, then record the audio separately and dub it over my newly spliced video and hope it syncs up”. That’s ludicrous. The inability to take screenshots not only serves no purpose for the actual creators of the movies or TV shows, it’s also a great hinderance to people who produce content like fanart and fan theories who would typically use such screenshots as references. By not allowing screenshots, you are actually turning legitimate customers of your content towards illegal streaming sites because This Is The Only Way To Take Screenshots Of Our Favourite Shows And Movies. No one wins. It’s frankly kind of bizarre that anyone ever thought this was a good idea."
2018-11-25 03:02:14,Not showing watched,5,Michellepizzalover,False,"Many times, I finish an episode with less than a minute left and when I go back to the menu, it says resume episode, then restarts episode.  I don’t want to watch it again, I just watched it.  I want it to show that I watched it so it is not sitting at the top of my stuff like it is new.  Sometimes I will restart the episode, fast forward to the end, then wait for the time to get down to 0 so that hopefully the episode will show as watched, which it doesn’t always do. There are currently 3 shows that I have completely watched, but say resume episode and I don’t know how to get it to acknowledge that I watched it.  There must be an easier way!  It’s bothersome."
2017-10-04 00:53:07,Terrible forward and rewind functionality,2,Terrible forward / rewind tool,False,"The latest update rolled out an upgrade to the forward and rewind tool. On the surface it seems like a lot of fun and simple to use, but in practice the new tool is a nightmare. It is incredibly easy to accidentally rewind to the beginning or end of the show simply by tapping the screen when it's gone dark or trying to pull up details on the next episode. You can correct your mistake either because it immediately sends you back into a 60-90 second commercial break that locks the forward / rewind tool. Once you've finished the break and can go back to your place, you have to watch another 60-90 second commercial break to return to your original placement. It's so incredibly frustrating I gave up and went back to the desktop experience. This tool needs more testing and revisions so it's not so easy to trigger."
2018-10-18 22:12:01,Inconsistency,2,Leek in boat,False,"There is this odd occurrence whenever I use this app and I usually run into a few problems:

1) Sometimes the next episode doesn’t play. It fails to load even if I am connected to the internet, am the only one watching, and have it all paid for.

2) Sometimes, even with good connection, the app doesn’t load up anything. It’ll open but every single tab says there is nothing to see here.

3) In the same vein as failure to load following episodes, there are times where I can’t even watch a completely different show. I could let the inconsistency of following episodes in a series fail to load slide, only a small bit though, but, when I can’t watch anything else for some reason? All of a sudden nothing is watchable?

In closing, either shows don’t load or the entire app doesn’t work properly. Inconsistency, sometimes it works really well and then the other half of the time it doesn’t work at all. I have deleted and reinstalled, I have turned off and restarted my phone, I have closed and restarted the app but it still has the same problem. I just end up not watching anything for a bit and do something else; which is great, although, if getting me to do something else was the goal, why pay for an inconsistent service at all?"
2018-10-24 21:23:31,Disorganized,1,Rebel Ghost,False,The constant changes to the layout just screams lack of confidence in the product and makes it very difficult to navigate. Please do something about the subpar subtitles do you actually watch and listen to the stories or are you just writing what you want. Fast forwarding and rewinding needs to be adjusted there’s nothing more frustrating then that suspenseful reveal that rolls right into commercial and you try to roll back a few seconds but have to watch another set of commercials. Very frustrating when you have to stop your device mid show only to come back to your place not saved and your going back and forth in the time line to find your spot only to have to watch two to three sets of commercials (I get that this service includes commercials but it’s the navigation that’s frustrating). Don’t be racist the stereotyping and picking what commercials you think I should watch is insulting.
2019-08-09 03:02:44,Autoplay Not Working!!!,1,Kdove98,False,"Autoplay is not working and randomly stops one episode in while other times the thing will play all night long when I fall asleep. The app is poorly designed and simple features like the ability to skip credit scenes and title sequences are missing yet the price is still the same NFlix. 

Why do you have to pay for a headache? How can this company not build an app properly? You have billions of dollars. 

Last time I canceled because the app was falling apart and riddled with error messages that even uninstalling couldn’t fix on my phone and tablet. And they have no appropriate customer service. You guys have no respect for your customers and that’s why you’ll always be second or simply lose them over time to better streaming services. Maybe I’ll just cancel every other month and keep signing up for the free first month option so I can cheat you as much as you’re cheating me."
2018-10-31 13:30:03,"Good! But, a few issues",4,Anon.2018,False,"I do not like the user interface set up all that much. For example, let’s say I just watched a series. I close app then re-open it at a later time. I expect to have that series somewhere on my dashboard but it’s not. In fact I typically have to retype it in the search box just to find it again. Second, I’m watching a show and I click to go to new episode; however, the GUI is gone! No play, backwards, forward, pause, scroll bar...nothing but an “X.” I contacted IT support and they didn’t know anything. So, it’s typical that I’ll have to refresh the page or log out and log in five to fifteen times over a few hours. But, in the end for the price and volume of shows it’s worth putting up with the glitches."
2017-10-06 16:44:08,Apply TV app is horrendous,1,nathanalf,False,"I honestly don’t even know where to begin. All the complaints below apply to the Apple TV app as that is the primary way I use it, and I can’t speak to the iPhone / iPad versions.

Half the time clicking on a title does nothing, especially in the “up next” pop up when an episode ends, and if you let the timer run down it replays the episode you just watched instead of skipping to the next one. Half the time when you do play an episode either the sound is a second off from the video (only fix is force quitting the app). Also have had the video appear not the play, click to play again and now two streams of the same episode are playing (one on top of the other) resulting in double audio - and the only fix is force quitting the app. I swear half of the time I use this app it is force quitting the app and waiting for it to reload.

Navigation is a HOT mess. Where are the simple badges saying which shows have a new episode available? Why is the “my stuff” category not available to filter by new episodes available? Why do I need to wait for the app to “fetch new recommendations” every single time I open it up?

I love love LOVE hulu’s service, and in the past the app has been very solid. However once this redesign rolled out I feel like the quality / reliability of the app has greatly suffered."
2019-11-20 04:42:56,UI suggestions....,4,Adam H..,False,"I can’t say anything about commercials and switching plans because I already have the Ad free version and I have live tv in other means, but, during playback, PLEASE...

Make the swipe to rewind/fast forward inactive until one swipes up enough first, or some other gesture to reduce unintentional swipes. I can’t tell you how many times I mess up the playback position while trying to pick up my one iPad without a case or cover because I tap the screen edge then bump the slider significantly.

Make the video not pause when going from Picture in Picture back to full screen if it’s already playing. The whole point of going full screen is to continue viewing on the full screen. I know it can be done...competitor apps do it."
2017-12-16 19:01:11,Need to make it more compatible with  iPhone X,5,wen_d_ta,False,"Besides everyone’s concern about the sensitivity on the rewind and forward, which I agree is soooooo frustrating, I just got the iPhone X and some shows don’t take up the full screen of the phone which is the whole point of the phone! The shows need to expand through the whole screen. also it would be very helpful if they could but the time as well on the iPhone 7 when you tapped of the screen you would see the time come down and now I have to click out of the app to see what time it is and that’s frustrating as well... I know it’s a process and you’re trying i hope my suggestions help!"
2018-03-28 21:10:05,Where are all the seasons at???,2,PotatoeKing,False,"I'm very disappointed with the fact that almost all the shows you have never finish the show. They're always missing seasons unless it's a 1/2 season show! This is very dumb not only because we cannot finish our show BUT shouldn't all those ads you put in the middle of our shows make you enough money to give us a full series??!!!! This is very annoying. For example one of my shows had to end on an episode where there is still so much story to be told, but I could not experience this show because of this terrible idea. This is ABSOLUETLY outrageous considering we're supposed to be able to ""catch up on all our favorite shows"". This slogan is a HUGE LIE. If you want an app where you can stop watching in the middle of a plot on a show BECAUSE THEY COULDN'T SPEND SOME OF ALL THAT MONEY THEY MAKE GIVING US SOME GOSH DARN ENDINGS TO FINISH OUR SHOWS!!!!!😡"
2017-11-21 05:01:55,Can’t play in background,3,Dragon vale man,False,"I’m not going to say the new update is terrible because I honestly don’t think it is. I however have been annoyed at the fact that the tv shows can not be played in the background on the device. Normally people will listen to music as they use their device. However, for me that is tv shows. Because I have watched this particular show so much I don’t need to physically see it anymore, I have it playing in the background. Like another reviewer said, no one should be expected to stay glued to a show for an extended amount of time. That user wanted PIP and his PIP was revived. Last night even I was able to play in the background starting Saturday the 18th and ending the 19th. Please bring this back or install it if what I was experiencing was a bug. Thank you for you time."
2019-07-03 20:03:22,Better mobile experience than on home TV,4,nicki names,False,"The mobile app is pretty good. Navigation is thoughtful and fairly well-organized. The mobile app also allows you to immediately press an icon in the center of the screen to go straight to the live broadcast instead of starting at the beginning for shows in your recording list. For some strange reason, that button is missing in the Fire tv version of the app. As a result, I have to manually hold the right button to fast forward to get to the live stream. Annoying, and particularly confusing for my elderly relatives who wonder why the show is not live and on a delay. This needs to be more like navigating and consuming on a cable provider (can’t believe I just said that)."
2018-09-21 20:25:56,Giving 5 because many fixes have been done,5,Fantasticallyella,False,"Firstly, it’s 5 to try and help weigh in against all the people who complained about losing HDMI because it’s been fixed.

And on that note thank god the HDMI lightning connector works again. There was no way I was gonna budge and spring for additional technology when I’m broke A/F all the time. 

The overall selection seems to be getting more bunk. Maybe start adopting shows like The Last Man on Earth as Netflix has done with Arrested Development for example. That being said I still find shows on here worth the amount I pay for the subscription. 

Smoothish transitions from episode to episode. I think the forward / backward 10 and 30 seconds is odd I’m used to the 1:1 that most video players use.

Lastly I think the selection screen - at least on a mobile device - is too large and requires too much scrolling. Again comparing to Netflix, while browsing you can view several show title cards and multiple categories at once. For the regular streamers that’s great when I’m trying to just generally peruse highlighted shows."
2020-08-04 02:47:24,The worst app I’ve ever used,1,CkBailey8816,False,"Seriously where do I start with how garbage this app is both on my computer and phone. I honestly hate this app with a passion which is the only reason I’m writing this review. 

It will start playing randomly when you leave it open. Just logged me off for no reason whatsoever. Terrible interface when selecting shows or trying to find the show you were previously watching. I guess you have to log in ever 30 days just to still get live TV WHICH IS SOMETHING I PAY EXTRA FOR ALREADY. There is no way to switch between live shows like just pressing a ‘last’ button. If you skip around a show because the app sometimes doesn’t save your place it’ll make you rewatch commercials you just saw. 

Truly one of the worst apps I’ve ever used which is hard to do. Especially coming from such a major company. If I didn’t pay for the service I would get rid of it in a heartbeat."
2020-06-15 02:33:16,It’s awesome but has some cons,4,hedeejejbcdh,False,Ok this app is amazing but here are some cons a lot of the time when I press on the app it just turns off and I tried powering off my phone two times it still didn’t work :( and it sometimes turns off while I’m trying to watch a show and when I go back on it. It also rewinds a bit :(also it needs to add season 2 of 911 :( because if you try watching season 3 with out watching season 2 you will be completely lost:( also sometimes it puts me on a different spot on a episode of a show than where I was on that episode :( but I do like all the variety of shows and movies it has :) although I talked a lot of bad on this review it overall is a amazing at app! And these are just my opinions :3
2019-07-31 16:14:15,News subscriber,3,Ranget1,False,"Just switched from sling last weekend so my rating is based on limited experience...
So far I’ve found navigating the apps (on my fire stick and the iOS mobile app) to be cumbersome. The live tv controls are nothing like any cable, satellite, or other streaming tv options I have used... the guide is not good and only has next episodes as far future viewing so you have to search if you looking to record something. And going in and out of the guide and watching live tv is nothing short of frustrating to this point. I’m sure it will get easier with repetition but really... my wife will never have it down. And then there’s the no AMC or Paramount channels. The good thing is I can cancel at any time and there is a lot of content so hopefully they can improve the TV guide soon!"
2018-10-24 01:14:13,"Great live TV, not the best navigation",4,nickgreene25,False,"It’s a bulky interface that requires too many clicks to achieve what your looking for. This has been a great alternative to Cable, and we’re happy with the quality of streaming, but the guide and actions are not very simple. Would be easier if there are options to go straight to live TV at startup rather than having to go from main menu every time. Better sorting options for the guide would be nice too, like maybe having a favorites sections. They have “news” and “sports” channel guides, but often times they leave off channels that it might not deem in those categories, even if it is. Just needs a little refining for a better experience, but overall it’s better than paying for cable."
2019-12-01 20:00:20,Needs a fix but good,2,Lugubrinilily,False,"I love the app. Easy interface with a great selection but, commercials please fix them, I’m okay with the breaks and it makes sense but why another set of commercials just because I rewinded it 10 seconds? It doesn’t make sense, it should skip passed them since I already watched them I shouldn’t be penalized for wanting to replay a part of the show. Is there a wider variety of commercials also? I seem to always get the same ones. Another thing that really really needs fixing is the buffering icon in the middle of the screen when watching on my laptop, if I so as rewind a few seconds back it will stay in the middle of the screen and my only option to get rid of it is to reload the page, not only does that not continue where I left off but it’s could also be susceptible to ANOTHER COMMERCIAL BREAK. Please fix"
2019-05-28 19:06:31,Random issues with no pattern,2,roegner,False,"So I need subtitles, but sometimes when a commercial break is over the subtitles will randomly stop working. Now the audio cut out completely for no apparent reason. I think it’s also very irritating when I open or slide into my notifications screen or quick settings screen that the show I’m watching won’t play in the background, and just pause automatically. Furthermore, it is astonishingly annoying how if I slightly move or tap something on screen that my video will slide away. I feel like there should be an arrow specifically for minimizing the video, instead of relying on everything to slide. Lastly, if I slide out of a video for just a few seconds, I shouldn’t have to watch 90 seconds of commercials all over again to just continue my show. 

Please resolve these issues, thank you."
2020-09-26 13:36:24,"So annoying, worst streaming service ever",2,Avelj,False,"I originally downloaded the app because there was a TV series I wanted to watch, full house after finishing that I started watching total Bella’s and total Divas. 
With total Bella’s it was pretty good not many malfunctions but when I got to total divas it all went wrong, there are was too many ads. At the beginning of the show there weren’t many ads but as I went along there was an ad after EVERY SCENE and it was the most annoying thing because I can’t just enjoy my show for 5 minutes. The most annoying part about this app is I will be watching something one minute and the next it time lapses my show and SKIPS A WHOLE 10 MINUTES! Then it goes to an ad and when I go back to watch it, I have to watch the ad again. They really need to work on this app because it was designed TERRIBLY. Bad app."
2018-05-12 02:19:33,Anyone else disappointed with new update?,5,Mooveychick,False,"Just curious if anybody else is having trouble with the new update. There have been many times that I’ve been watching a show on my iPad, then all of a sudden it stops and an error message comes up saying I can’t watch the show in my region. I’m in the United States people! And then I try other shows and it gives me that same message. I’m also having trouble with the show playing and then all of a sudden it jumps back to the very beginning where the television network logo comes up and then it will jump back to where I was watching. I don’t know what’s going on. It was working fine prior to this update"
2017-11-22 11:51:08,What the hell,1,Marshire,False,"So, I’m one of those people that likes to rewind on my favorite scene. So, I loved it when more streaming services added the fast forward and rewind ten seconds buttons. However, is there any reason that they need to be in the middle of the screen blocking everything? Does the screen need to be dimmed when it does this? Short answer. NO. What worse is when when your pausing or using the 10sec but and hit anywhere else on the screen, either to close the dimming or by accident, the show will skip to wherever you touched. Dudes that’s what the bar at the bottom is for. You tried to make something more convenient and instead made it aggravating as hell. Literally just had the show start over twice because of this idiotic feature and I wouldn’t let me skip the tv shows channel thing that before. So, I ended up watching it three times. Seriously, not useful at all."
2017-09-14 00:18:38,Awful,1,zhansen06,False,"The old app worked fine but was very clunky. I didn't think an update could be this bad. This app is difficult to use and is not intuitive at all. Oftentimes it errors out when playing the next episode of a show, forcing me to grab a device and attempt to play it again. 

I really just cannot stand the way this app is organized now. Sure, it's pretty, but the ""Home"" tab lists a SINGLE show. Across an entire iPad display. A complete waste of screen real estate. ""My stuff"" tab shows a list of your shows that you enjoy watching but it is organized in a complete non-categorical way. Very frustrating. Finally when you search for a show you want to watch (the best and easiest way to find anything, given this app's poor design), you have two small boxes with the last episode you left off on, and the latest episode. Once again, poor use of a huge iPad screen. You have tabs at the top for ""episodes"", but unless you know better, ""seasons"" is buried inside there as a small link. 

Constructive feedback? I suppose change ""episodes"" into a ""seasons"" button or something of the sort. However this won't change the overall design of the app being so poor and the waste of screen space. 

The old app was very old and also very clunky, BUT at least it was laid out logically."
2018-09-25 08:48:32,Five stars EXCEPT,5,👍🏼💪🏼👌🏼,False,"Five stars...Except the latest update. instead of the movie just automatically switching to horizontal view when you push play, it stays small and brings up the list of shows you’ve watched previously/are in the middle of. Why would I want to see those while I’m watching a show? They take up over half the screen....
It’s stupid and annoying that I have to click a million buttons just to get it to full screen. And half the time the full screen button doesn’t work cause it’s so small the heat from my finger bypasses it and just makes the play/pause/full screen options disappear—so then I have to tap it again."
2020-04-24 08:32:28,App is good but few problems,4,yurr123,False,The fast forward and rewind should be 10 seconds. when you are watching a show and you want to take a break it should go to my stuff so you can watch it later or resume where you left off. you have the live tv option the bottom of your screen in between my stuff and search. Also you should have a section for stuff that will come out soon so people can have notifications if they like it so when it comes out they could watch it. You should also make it easy for customers to change their plan if they want to in the account section because it is very annoying to have to go from the app to the website.
2019-07-27 08:46:52,Good and bad,5,Quentin Acosta,False,"Ok so I’ve had this for about a month now I like that it has a lot of different things but since I’m paying for this service I’m I’m sure others are as well I believe we are not getting our money’s worth. For instance why is it that the fairy tale anime has been out for yrs and you guys only have the first 2 and the very last season dubbed in English like come on to be honest all the anime’s should have a dubbed version , and what’s up with your movies you guys need a more vast variety of them because like a handful of good ones again this are just some things I think is in your power of fixing so for everyone’s sake please fix it thank you"
2018-10-24 02:11:14,Shows watched,3,Flyerthanfly1,False,"For some reason, several of my shows display episodes unwatched since the first season, first episode even if I’m all caught up. I’ve tried re-watching the last/most current episode of each show to change the status to “all caught up” and I’m still not getting that status. It would be helpful if I could check which episodes I’ve already seen or check that I’m all caught up so I don’t have to try and re-watch episodes and I can be notified of new episodes. It’s really annoying to have to re-watch episodes or even trying to fast forward through episodes, but having to watch commercials to fast forward. Please don’t make me re-watch all episodes from the series premiere just to show that I’m all caught up. Please fix."
2018-05-25 04:00:55,chrome cast not working after update,4,GO4MJ,False,"loved the app.  brag and told everyone about it and to subscribe. literally NO ISSUES and completely diff experience than any of these reviews. after recent update, can no longer use with my chrome cast and unfortunately i am a single and working mother and I can’t sit online to try and fix your app for you with customer service. the whole point in cutting off cable is to not deal with service issues and people and to spend more time doing things that matter.   I will give it until my next billing cycle and cancel if it isn’t fixed.

UPDATE: after writing this review, my issue has been fixed.   and the updates are wonderful and friendly."
2019-06-25 20:02:01,Resetting closed caption for every episode...why?,1,hearingimpaird001,False,"On my iPad it’s Quite frustrating to have to reset the closed caption button each and every time a new episode starts, even though closed caption button says its on. I have to select “auto” and reselect”on”, in order to get the closed caption to work....at every episode.  I am hearing impaired and need the closed caption set for all shows without having to reset it all the time. Ohhh, and the real fun part is....sometimes when resetting the closed caption, the sound goes completely off as well! Now that’s really enjoyable! I have uninstalled and reinstalled app multiple times. Please squash this bug!

Also closed caption on my smart tv runs about 2 sentences to late and picture jumps all over the place. Again, have disconnected and reconnected internet multiple times to no avail. I usually give up and turn on Netflix, which works fine."
2020-04-28 10:25:51,Latest update crashes instantly,3,DjinnAE,False,"The app itself is pretty good. Wide selection. Annoyingly doesn’t have a skip intro feature and when playing picture in picture it won’t immediately load next episode but these are small things. Most recent update has screwed the pooch. Instantly crashes as soon as you open it. Have tried power cycling, deleting app and reinstalling. Please fix. Kind of annoying that subscription apps often take a long time to fix these things (looking at you HBO) but don’t give any refund on their monthly charges. A few days is understandable but it should extend your next billing date. Paying for an unusable service, especially when stuck in isolation with limited options for entertainment is not good."
2019-09-21 13:32:10,SCAM,1,Schwahnee,False,"I went in to start off with the one month free trial, but I was charged incorrectly. I had to talk to four separate people and it took five days to finally get a refund for an error on Hulu’s part. The whole thing made if feel like a scam where they hope you don’t notice the missing charges, and even if you do you need to go through all the steps and take your time to try and correct their error. At the end of it all I was not even offered any compensation(like a free month) even after all the time I spend trying to fix their error. Besides that, who would want to pay money and get ads? For $12 per month you get no ads but even that subscription has many things that you are unable to watch. Also, even if you get the subscription that is “ad-free” you still experience ads with some shows. I definitely would not recommend."
2018-04-27 16:41:32,Playback problems,4,SPOOK-e,True,"I would often forward the video about hafway through an episode of a series by accident, and I would then have to go through 90 seconds of commercials to fix my mistake. Because this app allows you to forward/forward a video by tapping anywhere on screen, this makes it easier for me to repeat this mistake. I think if where was a different methods to move through videos would help, that I  won’t mess up again and have to wait through so many ads all because I tried to clear a text and accidentally moved from the beginning of an episode to near the end. Besides this issue, this app works great for me and I haven’t encountered any other issues."
2020-04-11 04:30:44,Keeps crashing,5,elizann79,False,This is usually my favorite go to app to watch tv shows but lately it has been messing up. Since the beginning of the year after commercials it totally locks up and won’t play anything. I usually have to close app and then reopen. Which is highly annoying. Then it started not being in sync with the voices after commercials. I would have to close app and reopen. Now it is crashing after commercials. It did this on the tv app so I started using my iPad and now it is crashing on here also. I just deleted app and will try again. I hope it actually works since I am paying money for this.
2018-12-16 20:38:55,JUST PATHETIC!!!,5,SpartaMix,False,"The app is ok but could certainly benefit from small quality of life improvements such as: adding a “WATCH FROM BEGINNING” BUTTON! Another thing I need to point out. I’m subscribed to sprint and therefore have the free version of the app. The issue here lies with the ad commercials and rewind/forward buttons: at random, during any episode, both buttons become disabled with a prompt showing “rewind/forward is not allowed during commercials” but I’m not in the middle of any commercials!!!!! I want to watch something from the beginning and I can’t because 1) there is no button with the option 2) the app is riddled with bugs and glitches! 

JUST RIDICULOUS!"
2019-06-10 01:22:55,Good app with some cons,2,Mashlomikh,False,"The app has lot of shows and variety but the biggest complain from almost every customer is the ads. It makes the experience VERY unpleasant. Not to mention, a little touch to the screen and it'll either moves or shuts down and take you back to main page. If you decide to go back where you left off, this is where it gets extremely annoying, it takes you back to first commercial you started with. You can't move forward or rewind, you're basically stuck by watching the same commercials over and over. 
Personally, I'm so close on giving up and cancel to find better provider. They tell you for extra$6 you can watch without commercial but it's not the case, because some shows may still restrict you from forwarding or rewinding."
2018-09-13 05:28:16,Pretty annoyed about the latest update,5,TychaBrahe,False,"Running the app on iPhone. As of five hours ago it would go full screen when I rotated my phone and had portrait lock off. Now I have to press an icon on screen. Decreasing utility is NOT an enhancement. 

Because of this, the app will only go full screen with the volume buttons at the bottom. Thanks, but sometimes I put my phone down to the right of the outlet, and I don't want my charging cable wrapped around my phone.  Also, with the volume buttons on the bottom I can no longer adjust the sound without picking up my phone.  Again, decreasing utility is NOT an enhancement."
2017-09-17 14:18:03,Remove Picture in Picture,3,KismetKat,False,"How could they have removed the most useful feature? I can no longer multi-task while watching a program because they removed Picture in Picture support. And, if you accidentally touch the left side of the screen in certain spots, the video starts over again. When you try to recover and drag you finger along the time bar, the same picture shows in the background so you have no idea if you've gotten back the the same o,Ave you were before the video reset. Not sure why they don't check out the competition (Netflix) who does this very well. Oh, and when I upgraded to the new app I had to fill out all my interests again and it seems to have lost my viewing history. Terrible experience!!"
2019-10-13 19:06:58,"Brutal critique, kinda",4,Catch22Bandsban,False,"Why the hell is there only the option of fast forwarding 30 seconds? Literally every other streaming application has 10 seconds. If you guys are so hung up on having the 30s+ option then let people choose to have a 10s option. The “my stuff” section is miserably set up and would be appealing if it was organized like Netflix has their “my list”. Why should I do an endless across just to find something that’s at the bottom? AND “All caught up” should have it’s own subsection. 

Anyways I love the selection of shows you have available. The movies are way better than anything Netflix will have. You guys have a big selection of anime shows and I really like that"
2019-03-31 03:35:26,Good but has one problem,4,Superheroes are awesome,False,"This app is very good if you have a premium subscription which isn’t extremely expensive compared to other streaming services. The way they market this service is truthful. But I share a subscription with other people who watch different shows than me and whenever I load up the app it recommends me their intended recommendations. It’s similar to Netflix where you still have the separate name accounts but the only thing you have to yourself is the name and the shows and movies in “my stuff”. Also if someone watched the same show as me, while sharing a subscription, you’ll pick up where they left off. Make the accounts more privatized please."
2017-12-26 21:17:32,Frustrating,1,Pandoramom,False,"Two main things that irk me about the newest version of the app... first, as I’ve read many people complain about, the fact that the bar across the bottom that shows the progress of the episode extends through the whole screen, so if you bump the screen or tap somewhere a little off, it advances or rewinds the show to a different place.  So frustrating.  

Second issue, it used to be that you almost got “credit” for watching the commercials the first time, so if you rewinded, either on purpose or accidentally, it would skip the commercials you already watched the first time and just play.  Now if you bump the screen and it rewinds, not only do you have to rewatch the commercials but it seems like they are longer! 

Both of these issues make watching on the app very frustrating and not enjoyable. It needs to be fixed!"
2020-06-09 06:55:41,Not much disability access,3,Jim from Gainesville FL,False,"Please do you like other apps like Netflix, would you pay your monthly subscription you have access to everything. Also where is your audio described content. Shows like a law and order SVU on other apps that had it before you bought it had all the episodes I have described. I haven’t found any of yours they do. I’ve been away for a few years thought I would come back and check it out. I’ve got a few weeks left. I may leave again if I cannot find the other describe content I need. Otherwise you have a great library of shows and movies. Would like to appreciate all of it, but I’m not going to pay monthly subscription and then pay more on my heart for shows. Not fair to ask that."
2020-05-28 18:37:43,Audio,4,LoeShadowsTTV,False,". I’m watching Naruto shipudden right and you know how there’s a feature where you can either watch dubbed or subbed right English or Japanese or whatever well I’m watching naruto and it’s on dubbed then the next episode it’s on subbed so I look at episodes right and it shows the rest of the episodes are subbed, like you see dubbed and subbed of the same episode but then the rest is all subbed and it’s on the episode called truth.   S:3 E:141.    That’s when it becomes all subbed and the rest of episodes after that is all subbed too.        So can you fix the problem where there is no more dubbed version of the episodes and make it where there is dubbed versions of the episodes.           

            Thank you"
2018-01-17 18:29:43,Horrible Update.,1,MiseruzP,False,"I like the old version. This version has a horrible layout. The rewind and fast forward feature are horrible. When they first updated the app I was watching a show. I tapped the screen to pause it and it rewound. That’s frustrating. I sometimes have to rewind to see something and sometimes it’s right before a commercial break. As you know, you can’t rewind on a commercial break. When I do rewind it plays the part of the show I needed and goes to a commercial AGAIN!! It never used to replay the commercials!! I don’t know if it’s because of the “no commercial” version they have now. Maybe they have to make up not showing as many commercials in the “no commercials” version or what. But, Mama no likey. After my first encounter with the new app I stayed off for months! My shoes are piling up and I basically have to use this app. I just miss the old version."
2018-02-10 04:13:35,Worst ux please go back to previous version,1,Dmnyu,False,I can’t find the content I’m looking for! It might look nicer design wise. But the user experience is terrible. I touch the screen by mistake and the video jumps to a different time line. Then the commercials appear and I can’t go back to where I was until I finish watching some terrible commercials. It makes me angry to use this app it’s really buggy with zero thought about the user. And the sad part is that the old version (similar to the web version you have on your website) was great. I loved using it. It was easy to find content. Simple to navigate. Simple to rate. Simple to move to a different time in the video. Why did yo have to complicate it??? I don’t care about design and fancy fonts...I care about having a seamless user experience and watching my videos with zero frustration. Please go back to the older version!!
2017-11-04 05:32:16,Previous version was better,5,MichelleeRuiz,False,"HATE how there is an Account tab but you cant do anything, all it says it to go to the site. What’s the point of it being there if you can’t do anything anyways? This should have been available a looonnggg time ago. Also, the new update made it worse, it was good before. To be brief, all the other reviewers list the same problems that I would. 
Also this has nothig to do with this update but it would be nice if you could make the next episode start automatically after the episode your watching ends instead of going through all the credits."
2018-06-22 15:36:09,absolutely horrible,1,skyeasher,False,"i would rate this 0 stars if i could. the fast forward/rewind is extremely frustrating and makes this app almost IMPOSSIBLE to use. i really recommend you DONT get this app. the makers don’t listen to the suggestions the viewers have and i can guarantee they don’t read the reviews. the amount of ads on this app is almost overwhelming, and having to rewatch commercials is so annoying. every time i try to watch a show that’s 1 hour, it ends up taking 3 hours to finish because of watching and rewatching commercials, i can’t fast forward or rewind correctly, and frankly, the update didn’t help at all. the price is also very high compared to the quality of what you’re purchasing. all in all 0/10 app, would not recommend to anyone who actually has stuff to do and can’t spend 2 or more hours watching 1 episode at a time"
2020-06-19 18:00:15,Can’t Make An Account with different emails,2,Acronics,False,"I have to ask why I can’t use a free trial with different emails that have varied information. Every time I try I just get a notification on me phone that states that I already have an account that links to my Apple ID, would I like to log in? When I select no, to start a new one for a different email so it can experience a free trial, the app denies me from moving any further in the process. Ultimately, preventing me from watching again without paying money. I get Disney seized the rights for FX to stream their OWN shows on THEIR platform, but the fact that I can’t create different free trials with different emails without being forced into the same one is ridiculous. Great App, but forces money out of your pocket after a month just because the Apple ID is the same. Smh"
2018-09-29 11:49:17,I’m Not Happy At All,2,Megan Mad,False,"Currently I’m having the trouble with how the app won’t load ANYTHING. What’s the point of paying for a service to watch tv shows when the shows won’t load to be able to watch them? The commercials are VERY repetitive, and don’t even get me started on how long they take to load, sometimes it takes just as long as it takes to load up the episodes. I was astonished when I learned there wasn’t a an option to pay to get rid of the commercials, because now I know that EVERYONE has to live through the pain that I have. I can not believe how terribly glitchy this app is, it’s practically unusable, and it makes the experience of watching my favorite shows completely unbearable. PLEASE fix this, we are paying to use this service and we deserve better."
2020-09-26 23:19:27,"It's a great app and all, but I have an issue...",4,AnthonyOmyz,False,"I can't deny the fact that the app is one of the most used entertainment streaming services that I have, it has most of my favorite and shows that I want to see. But I have encountered a bug when I try and tried to watch a show/anime I have noticed that my list on my phone does not refreshes the list I have on watched and doesn’t keep track of what I’m watching, it has only work with the previous saved shows. I have log out to see if that fixes the problem but it doesn’t, I just wished it gets fixed, so I can continue watching my shows on my phone cause I don’t encounter this problem on my laptop"
2018-10-24 23:32:05,Over commercialization successful.,1,nicknamesnottakenjustwanttostp,False,"I’m a capitalist I get trying to squeeze a little more profit out of your service, but this is taking it too far.      Then you make it worse by making FF or RR anywhere near the commercials an invitation to watch the whole set of commercials, 200+ seconds of commercials to be exact, again!   Oh and you manage to get through the commercials to start watching your show and the app locks up.   You have to restart the app.  Then you restart your show.   Remember those commercials you watched right before the app locked up?   Yep.   Better get ready to sit through those same commercials again.     Mind you all this is on the less commercials plan that costs extra.  I was really happy with the live TV plan until you went nuts with the commercials.  I’m gonna try other services like PlayStation Vue or Sling."
2020-03-22 22:16:43,Add some things please,4,Roee B.,False,"Your content is amazing! But you are missing so many key features. First of all why don’t the subtitles go to the top of the screen when there’s a credit or any kind of text on the bottom of the screen. Netflix & Disney+ do that why not you. 

Also would it kill you to make a skip recap & skip intro button. I don’t want to watch a recap of an episode I just watched. Also I don’t always want to sit through the entire theme song.

In conclusion, you have a great service with great content but you are really lacking in features. I’d really appreciate if you add these. I’m sorry if I sounded rude but I just really want these features."
2020-01-29 23:47:29,Love it but some issues,4,pooolhall,False,I love this app but when hooking to my tv from my AV/USB adapter it will not play on my screen. I got the Apple brand adapter so it’s not the cheap adapter that’s the problem. Sometimes one show will display fine but when I go to watch another one it won’t display. I have to close the app and reopen it and sometime even that doesn’t work. Other than that I absolutely love the app. I love catching up on my favorite shows and being able to rewatch shows I used to watch. My son also loves it. If it would play with no issues then I wouldn’t have any problem with it. It would get a 5 star rating. I will re-rate the app after that is fixed.
2017-11-11 01:15:05,Best app I’ve seen,5,TheTank421,False,"Everyone else complaining about commercials and missing content when rewinding or ff. There is an option to have no commercials but these poor scrubs are too cheap to pay the extra couple dollars. And they complain about problems that only exist because they create them from nothing. It’s a great app, and those who give it bad ratings, just know that they are those people that give EVERY app a bad rating because they aren’t tech savvy and are mad at the world. Nothing in this world is perfect and never will be, stop complaining about everything and give accurate responses, like me."
2017-09-28 00:30:46,Get ready to scroll,5,demonduck77,False,"Great variety in programming, but the UI is ridiculous.  You should not have to scroll through the same menu over and again.  It is completely unacceptable to have to scroll through the same programs because your place is not held.  Let's say you are scrolling through HBO movies and open a movie whose title starts with M.  Add it to your watch list and back out to the previous menu, and it drops you all the way back at A.  You are forced to scroll through all of the same programming again and again.  This is with the latest update on the newest model iPad."
2017-10-26 22:11:25,Not user friendly and buggy,1,FatBoy1185,False,"It takes a while to get used to this app but it’s not intuitive at all. Like, trying to figure out how to see a specific episode, or even just trying to skip to the next episode. The other issue is that it keeps getting stuck in subtitles mode. It used to be that you’d have to turn them off every episode because they’d magically come on. Now they magically come on and you can’t turn them off. So you have to close the app after every episode and re open it again so the the subtitles go away. The other crappy thing is that if you pause the show and then touch anywhere on the screen the show jumps to a different spot on the timeline. You end up constantly changing where you’re at in the show or movie accidentally. Maybe it’s just me. Who knows. But this app needs work"
2018-12-21 10:11:53,Love it!,5,Nacho-Gamer,False,"I’ve had issues in the past but it seems that they actually read the reviews and fix them. I had an issues where I would get logged out for NO reason. No longer an issue so thanks. 
I would love to see you guys add a download feature without charging us extra. You know you can watch videos offline. I would also love to see that we can make actual account changes. Some people have not have access to a computer to do account changes. You could make more money by allowing people to subscribe to channels and what not. Please consider these!"
2020-10-02 18:25:22,Still has issues,1,normajean98,False,"It still lagging. I just literally made my account and then it redirected me to log in, and it says my log in doesn’t exist 🙄 I’ve tried multiple times and nothing. I check my email and no reset link ever came in, checked my spam mail, etc. I did everything it says to get my account info, and it says it’s not recognize able. When I started over to start another account with the same information it says “looks like you already have an account and the website redirected me to the log in, and when I tried logging in it went on to say it still doesn’t recognize my account log in information. This is ridiculous i don’t know why the creators of this app say that they have fixed issues other subscribers were complaining about and it’s still the same..."
2020-08-19 23:13:30,Slow down with the ads,4,vfffffggsdu,False,I would i’ve gave it a five if there wasn’t so many ads so my suggestion for you is to slow down with the ads and that’s all I have to say because everything else is good so just make sure that there’s less ads and you will probably have a better rating everybody will probably give you five but you know that’s my opinion and I think it’s just slow down on the ads if you can do so much ads make them shorter but yeah cause it’s really annoying cause every five seconds ad ad ad and plus when I go back I shouldn’t have the same ad if I already watched it then don’t make me watch it again I
2020-01-08 03:45:33,Bad app,1,Breezyflu,False,"I use an iPhone 7 with the latest iOS and trust me when I say this is not a friendly app for it. There is a constant error message when watching a something that, when it happens, forces the app to forget where you are in it and either makes you start from the beginning, goes back 5-10 minutes, or makes you go to the next episode. Now if I had only lost 5, maybe ten, minutes it wouldn’t be an issue but this happens every 15 to 30 minutes several times AN EPISODE (I have been binging white collar when this happens and watching no a few other movies) it becomes annoying. And no this is not an iOS problem, this was happening when my phone was on iOS 11-ish and I thought updating would help, which it didn’t. This app is very broken and clearly not phone and/or iOS friendly."
2018-04-27 19:58:40,Counterintuitive Garbage,1,ottonomy,False,"Please go back to the old old app version from before you thought you could reinvent the wheel. It worked. Everyone liked it. No one was confused. No one was accidentally whisked to the wrong part of a show, and forced to watch the same commercials all over again. Yes, this latest update has made a marginal improvement over the last absolutely inexcusable embarrassment of an update. It’s merely somewhat horrible now. Here’s an idea: Just let me tap or drag on the transport bar like every other video player app in existence. It works. It takes no effort to learn. It never does anything unpredictable. And it doesn’t require starting a drag over more than once just to reach the desired portion of a show. Please please please go back to the old old version, and don’t try to fix this worthless piece of garbage."
2017-11-02 04:11:46,Rewind/Fast forward,2,sci-fi love,False,"I hate that you can’t get a completely full screen, it drives me nuts, but the absolute worst thing that needs to be changed ASAP is the rewind fast forward thing. If you tape ANYWHERE or if there’s a fingerprint mark on your screens and you try to fix it, even if it’s paused it rewinds or fast forwards all the way to that point in the show and then you end up watching commercials again, which I’ve done countless times. Also, it even fast forwards to the next episode by accident which I’ve done several times. Then you have to go back to your last episode and find out where on earth you were. There should at least be an option to undo your rewind or fast forward if it does so so easily. Please change as soon as possible."
2019-10-15 05:25:37,Latest for Apple TV. Better interface but worse functionality,1,Stiendjs,False,"The new guide looks good but lacks common sense like following the time. After I watch a live channel for a while then open the guide it is stuck at the time I turned my tv on. That makes no sense for live tv. Anyway maybe the next update. 
Would also like to see less downgrading of the stream quality. I have 125mb down and up fiber with consistent speed tests that match and it often down scales to lower resolution. Sometimes unwatchable. 
Oh and the app just locks sometimes and doesn’t respond. I can navigate the guide but a click does nothing. Have to kill the app and relaunch. 
The guide is cool if it worked. IMO the tiles are dumb. It switches from a guide view to tiles based on god knows what. For example all channels and recents look like a guide but sports is tiles. Huh???"
2018-05-20 16:51:54,Update is awful.,5,FranchiseOoh,False,"Like other reviews not only is Ffwd and rewind an issue if you even graze your touch screen while something is playing, but it also has stopped doing auto playback to play the next episode of any show. I have to close out of the full screen, to back, remember which episode I was watching and click on the next one to play it. 23 min later I’m repeating this process. Never used to have to do that before the feature became available. Please fix. Too many good enjoyment of Hulu’s platform opportunities lost here due to this poorly functioning update."
2018-10-08 04:26:29,Trash app,1,lolohaley,False,"Your app is trash.  It constantly has errors and outages, I pay for the service and still have streaming errors that have nothing to do with my internet service.  I say once again, your app is trash.  The content is poorly organized when it actually works, and new content is difficult to find which leads me to watching the same things.  Needs improvement to content discovery, needs improvement to overall serviceability.  Continued errors will lead to members searching elsewhere to find what they want to watch.  Why would I continue to get in the app in hopes that it will work when I can use another service that never gives me problems and allows me better access to content that I might want to watch.  Needs some real overhauling but thanks for the cheeky messages about updates"
2017-09-20 22:33:36,Tried to make it fancy but it's just difficult,1,kmeansbusiness,False,"The new update adds pretty colors and makes the overall app look better but ultimately extremely difficult to use. Instead of having your shows that you watch being front and center, they are now on their own tab with hulu's shows they are pushing being in your face as the first thing you see when you open the app. When you scroll through the shows they take over the entire screen, making it difficult to see all of your watchlist and pick a show. Also Having both the current episode you are on and latest right next to each other is super confusing and unnecessary. The old version was much more user friendly and I can see why many people, myself included, are having issues with the new update."
2019-01-24 12:02:55,Nice but could be better,4,Nelco_ut,False,"This is nice because it has most of the movies and tv shows BUT, it needs to be more like netflix in that you can tap the screen to pause and resume instead of just the pause button. 2nd, it needs to hav better marked buttons and some added to the main screen like to be able to go back an episode when u walk away or fall asleep. As is u hav to get out of everything and try and find the way to get into the show with out making it automatically start playing. You should be able to click play or the parts around the play button to go into the program."
2017-10-14 16:17:54,What did you do to this app?,1,randomusername098098,False,"It’s become unusable with the latest update. I tap on the bottom half of the screen to make the invisible controls show up, but instead the app rewinds or fast forwards. And when I open the app to keep watch the last thing I watched, that list is hidden among things you think I should watch and whatever is on my to watch list — and not in a navigatable gallery, but in full screen panels. The thumbnail for a show includes two buttons — a triangle and an arrow. They do two different things but are way too similar in appearance. And then I touch the text “continue watching”, instead of playing the selected video I’m taken to another screen describing what I’ve just indicated I want to watch. Please roll this terrible update back and make your app something I want to use again."
2020-01-31 16:03:10,Horrible service,1,Ms. Natruel,False,"If I could give ur Conpany a zero I would have bc regardless how busy u get how r u gonna shutdown ur phone lines with a voicemail abt call volume being too busy to answer and then the call disconnect fr hours!! 
Plus why have u NOT updated your shows that r YEARS OLD & when asked when’s it gonna be done u give some excuse abt the network not giving u permission yet but I notice that those that have live TV don’t have outdated shows so I’m thinkg this is a way to make people upgrade to ur more expensive package!!
And last but not least I think any1  that has to watch outdated shows should automatically qualify fr a lower priced subscription bc it’ should be illegal to do the things he u guys r doing to your customers so I will be going to Netflix or somewhere soon if u don't fix these  issues soon bc this is  unacceptable!

2019-07-04 06:19:11,Fix your app,3,Ceb992,False,"This app has gotten worse and worse. In the previous version, the show would get stuck and i would have to turn off my wifi, and then turn it back on. I got used to this glitch and was hoping that an update would fix the problem... the update came... made it worse. And now “my little fix” doesnt work anymore. It blames the error on my device, my modem, and my router... if that was the case, other streaming apps would have the same problem and they dont... so stop blaming the error on everything but your app and try to fix the problem... im tired of this error!! i want to watch my shows, i love your service, but the experience on this app is dreadful!!"
2017-09-28 14:28:54,I should have kept Netflix.,2,Jonny_Tapia,False,I don’t like that the app isn’t as user friendly as Netflix. The video and sound don’t always match up and sometimes it just lags all together. I signed up for the $5.99 offer they had going for a year and boy I guess you really get what you pay for. The app is always freezing and I’m having to close the app constantly and restart whatever episode from the beginning. And then when I find my place the sound is mute or is seriously lagging behind the video. I don’t mind the commercials but the actual show/movie is always glitchy and the stream is never consistent even when connected to WiFi. I swear the commercials look clearer and play a lot better than the actual show I’m trying to watch.
2018-01-18 00:27:58,"Screen sensitivity, subtitles",1,l'americalk,False,"I’ve seen that other people have addressed the issue of the forward/skip/pause button making the video skip to too wherever the finger touches the screen. This is super irritating especially when I want to pause a show and it’ll skip to the middle of the video so I have to rewatch whatever ads are in place just to rewind or forward to the part I was initially at before the pause. 

Also, for some reason instead of playing where I left off; every time after an ad plays the screen will load back to the beginning of the episode rather than the next part which also forces me to rewatch ads to get back to where I’m suppose to be.

 Annoying and makes me want to quit my subscription. I feel like I watch more ads than the show itself because of this issue and not to mention that ads take a long time to load which makes me force quit the app and have to start over the process of loading another ad. 

Another thing that has been malfunctioning with the app is that subtitles won’t load. I have a hard time hearing so it’s nice to be able to read subtitles especially when whatever I’m watching is in another language it’s necessary."
2020-08-13 05:10:56,DO NOT PAY FOR LIVE WITH THEM,2,Janna49,False,"I have tried their live service twice. On things I recorded, the commercials could not be fast forwarded- so honestly what is the point. The second time they were my only option to watch the last episode of my favorite show live and it kept skipping backward and playing the same parts over and over. I have 300 mbps internet service, when this was happening I checked the speed to make sure this was not the issue. Theo customer service is terrible, the only way I could “talk to someone” was by creating a twitter account, but it didn’t matter because the thing I was trying to watch was halfway over  and the experience ruined. They seriously expect people to pay $60+ a month for service like this."
2019-01-27 23:52:07,Needs A lot of work,5,honest reveiws101,False,"First of all it keeps jumping from spot to spot and then is won’t let me go back with out starting it over which brings me to my next point.
Secondly it makes me watch a 36 second add at the beginning then I watch 30-40 seconds of a show then I have to watch a 75 second add it doesn’t make since and so forth.  Maybe they could put all adds in before the show or something I don’t really know but it’s very annoying. To be clear I’m fine that they have adds it’s just the placement of the adds in the show or during the show."
2019-11-19 06:37:48,Buggy and forced to rewatch ads.,1,Alazingly Disappointed,False,"Just like everybody else's complaints. 
The app glitches out or can't load WAY too often. And to add to the misery of that, once I finally get back to my show, it didn't save my place properly, puts me right before a commercial that I viewed 10 minutes prior while watching. So when I fast forward to the proper place, I get to watch MORE commercials that I had already viewed. Double the commercials because of its glitch. 
I could get over the glitches and crashing if I didn’t have to rewatch every commercial.
If your internet crashes, restart the commercials. If you’re traveling and lose connection, restart the commercials. If the app glitches, restart the commercials.  Today I watched the same 90 second ad set 5 times because it kept restarting the same episode there. 
The interface is a pain, It’s a pain to get descriptions, actors/actresses.
When your phone is vertical If you accidentally swiped down it closes your show. If you accidentally touch your phone below the show it starts some random show or the next episode. Once you sort that out and get back to your original episode, it starts you back at a commercial break again."
2019-08-07 07:03:30,It’s 2019 and you’re still making people sit through ads? Really?,3,AL7777777777777,False,"If I wanted to see ads I’d go and watch cable. I have the student plan and honestly think it’d be a good idea to include no ads or at least limited ads along with it. Having to sit through four 2 minute long ads per tv episode (unless I pay more money) is just whack. Don’t even get me started on a full-length film. I’d rather just illegally pirate the show or see if it’s available on Netflix. I get that all you corporations want is money these days, but this will probably get more broke college students like myself to switch over from Netflix and get a student plan. So in the long run you would make more money."
2018-03-02 04:08:08,Disappointed,5,Mekacraig,False,"I have recently downloaded the app again and I can agree with everyone that has given reviews. It is not such a great app. And i loved it at first because you are the only one that has THe Golden Girls. I would love to watch it on my tv from the connection of my phone, but I am not getting a picture of the show. Commercials are fine but actual shows aren’t. I thought by me having an HDMI-in it wouldn’t affect it but it does. And I am on one of your supporting devices. Also the error messages are annoying. I really want to keep you but something has to give."
2020-07-23 00:33:23,Love the app but commercials are too long,5,unixornlover101,False,Ever since I downloaded this I loved the variety of shows and movies. I originally came on here to watch anime but I did my research. I found out they had 400 anime titles and maybe more! But whenever I'm in the middle of the show I have to wait about 2 minutes. Usually commercials are about 1 minute- 1 minute and 15 seconds. So if you could please stop it from going all the way to 90 seconds and make it at least 75 I would use this app so much more. I have always loved the app ever since I downloaded it and I still do.
2018-02-03 17:50:06,Worst. Interface. EVER.,4,shawsome.brian,False,"I can’t believe how difficult this is to navigate. It’s practically impossible to just browse through all the shows in a particular genre. WAAAAAAY too much swiping. Why only show one show at a time? How about a grid of artwork or just a list I could browse through? 

I don’t know a single person that likes it, especially on Apple TV. In fact, I do know people that have cancelled their subscription over this. It makes the service much less usable if it’s too difficult to get around. The service itself is great, but this new interface is a disaster. Looks reasonably pretty in concept, but crashes and burns in execution."
2018-01-18 04:03:10,Captions Are Terrible,1,HELP WITH SUBTITLES PROBLEM,False,"Whenever I tried to watch a Spanish movie I had the subtitles on just Incase I misinterpret something, but every now and then the captions just completely stop on me. I tried going to settings and toggling on/off and tried going to my phone settings and messing with the style and everything else. I’ve deleted and reinstalled the app and when I went back to make sure it wasn’t the movie I tried it on a random anime to see if it would translate and it didn’t. When I go to the settings bar when I tap the screen when a show is currently playing the Subtitles and Captioning is completely blacked out. It has an underlined link that says accessibility setting so I tap it and it leads me back right to where I started. I don’t know if it’s just for my phone but I know it’s definitely a problem."
2020-07-17 07:54:06,love the app! but some cons,4,shine💜💛🌟,False,"I love this app because I can watch a lot of my favorite shows. there are some cons about it though... 1. There’s WAY too many ads. I have to sit and watch a 90 second ad and then 5 minutes later, there’s another 90 second ad. 2. I’m paying for this, so why is there some shows that aren’t “included” to my subscription? and 3. Why is it that if I rewind 10-20 seconds, the same 90 second ad pops up that I already watched? This is way too many ads on here. It kinda makes me not wanna use this app because of how many ads there are and how long it takes to just watch through them."
2019-09-08 16:40:58,It’s okay,3,Mattiethe1,False,"I use this app to watch a few titles that I don’t manage to find on Netflix.. however I’m not a huge fan of the way that the app doesn’t keep track of where I am in the shows that I watch, so then I usually end up having to watch ads that I’ve already been through because it doesn’t allow you to fast forward to where you were at without requiring you to rewatch ads. Kind of annoying. I also don’t enjoy the feature that causes the show to close out every time I touch my screen the wrong way because sometimes I touch my screen to wipe away dust or something and it’s just super sensitive. I do enjoy watching my shows though nonetheless."
2018-05-22 00:04:06,This app is terrible,1,🧐🧐🙂,False,"The only reason I use this app at all is because I get it free with sprint, but I would suggest Netflix to anybody deciding what streaming site to use. First of all you are paying to be able to watch movies and tv shows but you get adds with all of them and the only way to get rid of the adds is to PAY EXTRA which is outrageous considering you are already paying to watch the movies and shows you want. Second, the site is set up in the most complicated and confusing way so it is extremely difficult to find the stuff you want. Another thing is that they don’t have a big selection of shows. They do get some of the shows right away though, and have some movies that Netflix doesn’t, but even with this I still do not recommend this site to anybody."
2018-01-18 21:12:23,Whyyyyyy,1,Lpow2,False,"I hate this update. Hate hate hate. Every time I pick up my iPad while watching something, even on the very edges of it, it automatically skips to wherever my finger landed. Also, why do I have to go into my tablets own settings to get subtitles to work? And on top of that, it doesn’t work. There should be an option WITHIN THE APP to have subtitles or not. Absolutely ridiculous. “My stuff” is not my stuff, you don’t show me things I’ve recently watched like on a computer, just random stuff you think I’ll be interested in. I have zero interest in watching the wall, I’m sorry. This is officially the poorest video payer. I feel like whoever designed is laughing maniacally as he reads all of these poor reviews, his plan of driving people absolutely crazy having been achieved. Does anyone read these? Back to Netflix I go."
2020-06-02 03:00:07,THE F******NG WORST,1,Whatisaygos,False,"All of this drama during the pandemic, and rioting! And all I want to do is focus on something else but Nope... Soon as I find a show. *90 secs ad* show credits start *90 secs ads* five mins into show *same 90 secs ad* 8 mins late *same 90secs ad* show ends *90 secs ad* end of show credits *90 SECS AD!!!* & repeats for the next episode! 0 stars from me forsure but it’s making put at least one smh. If it wasn’t for having slightly different movies than Netflix I’d def Delete and cancel. Straight headache.....also when the ads start the show keeps playin but without sound, then after like 3 secs the ad pops up. When the ad finish I’ve missed parts of the show and when I go back to see it puts me back in the (90 sec) ad! And all of that time counts against you meaning the next ad will start in 5 MINS instead of 8 🤦🏾‍♂️"
2019-05-09 10:07:57,Email about no longer being supported in older devices,3,Teakneepanys,False,"I am very understanding that sometimes technology becomes outdated. I have an older iPad that can no longer support being updated. I understand that there are apps that will become too technically advanced for this operating system. It is a fact of life.

However, the e-mail that I got from you makes it seem like obtaining another device to stream on is no big deal. “Continue to stream by upgrading your supported device or operating system.” “If you would like help setting up a new device” followed that sentence.

I cannot just drop hundreds of dollars on a new iPad to experience your app. Thanks for pointing that out to me."
2019-02-21 01:17:32,2 STARS,2,addison schneider,False,"I love that I can watch all the shows I want such as Speechless, American Housewife, and Single Parents. But here’s the problem when I am chilling on the couch watching my favorite TV shows I get furious when I have to sit through a minute and a half of adds every 5 minutes. This is especially angering when it is the same boring adds. SO PLEASE GET RID OF THE ADDS!!! At least make them shorter and like in the beginning, middle, and end instead of every 5 minutes. Other than that my only complaint is to have Disney channel because you don’t realize that some people don’t have Disney channel in their regular TV and want to be able to watch shows like Andi Mack, but the only Disney channel shows you have are old ones like K.C. Undercover and Dog with a blog."
2018-10-26 13:07:50,The Number Of Commercials Are Ridiculous,2,Kis*MyAss,False,"I understand your need for advertising to pay expenses and generate profit.  What I will never get my arms around is your need to disable fast forward options during these commercial breaks.  I do not watch content to watch commercial advertising.  Yet, I can fast forward through actual programming content but not advertising content, in most cases.  A clear signal that advertising is more important than content in your eyes, which we all know or advertisers pushing products they know people should not consume in the first place.  A clear compromise is the ability to fast forward through advertising content.  I personally do not watch commercial advertising for I mute.  Why waste customers time."
2018-05-27 09:34:59,Pretty good,4,Lia_419,False,"Great selection of shows, the app is easy to use and even offers the option to remove a show from recommendations, which is something no other streaming app has done. I am very pleased and surprised I use this more or just as often as Netflix. There is also the added benefit of having HBO. I would just say it’s kind of crap that I signed up through sprint as “limited commercials” but I end up having to watch the same ads 4-5 times per episode. Without the ads however, I think it deserves more stars on here, but I do agree that the rewind / fast forward functions take a few tries to “get” how to use."
2020-10-21 01:18:29,It’s Irritating,1,venombreon,False,"Most of the time, the things you want to watch won’t even play, its like its not even trying, it is super annoying and even if it does play, if you were in the middle of an episode before and you want to continue where you left off, instead of continuing where you were it goes right back to the beginning, meaning you have to start all over again! That is super irritating! Whoever was in charge of that function was an idiot! No one should have to start over on an episode unless they choose to do so! the last update was riddled with glitches! For som reason the clock and battery and service on the top half of the screen doesn’t hide like it’s supposed to, that is super Annoying!!!!! Can someone please fix this please, is that to hard to ask?"
2020-10-13 18:47:10,One piece,4,sarah rose howard,False,"I’ve been watching one piece for a few weeks and I watched it last night, but when I got on it today, it only showed the first season and 1 episode on season 7 so I cannot see any other seasons including the season I’m on. I can still watch the season I’m on which is good but I can’t see anything else. I look at the list of episodes on each season and specifically the season I’m watching to make sure I didn’t skip episodes. Also when I watch an episode it skips part of it either in the beginning or at random so if you could possibly look into that it would be a big help."
2020-05-01 18:18:04,Cancelled the Subscription,2,nori givanni,False,"I was excited to get this app after the trail expired. No issues or glitches during the trail period. When I signed up at the end of the trail for the no ads subscription, all sorts of issues began. Videos stopped playing, could not access any shows, and the screen would go blank. I decided to delete the app and add it again to see if that would reset it. It did. All videos would play without issues... then a day or two later it would start doing the same thing. I deleted and reinstalled the app on the daily just so I could actually watch videos. When my monthly renewal came up, I opted out. This app is too cumbersome if I have to install daily. I’ll find another streaming service"
2018-01-03 06:23:57,Pls change,1,animecookie123,False,"I don’t usually write reviews but I guess you could say this was really grinding my gears, but like most people have been saying, I can’t stand the new rewind/forward interface. Also, the fact that if I miss and tap the screen the wrong way it might put me at a spot where I have to watch an ad which is fine but your guys ads are super long, there’s like 4-5 ads that are usually around a minute and on top of that if I have to go forward to the place where I was at I might have to watch the ads all over again and at that point I feel like I’m watching more ads than I am tv. Also, how come I can’t switch profiles on my laptop? It seems like no matter what I do It won’t switch the profile, it just sends me to the website and gives me a overview of my account."
2019-11-17 05:28:10,Love The New Update,5,Cerealkeller,False,"You can now download some videos to watch offline, which is incredible for me.  Since I commute an hour daily, I like to listen to videos of some stuff in the background.  You can also now still keep the video playing with your phone locked and the screen off.  Awesome for headphones while working or driving.  Finally, I’ve wanted those two features for a long time and now we have them, 5 stars!  Now they just need to expand on what can be downloaded.  I wanted Seinfeld, but it was available for download."
2020-06-09 04:55:40,Good but a few cons,4,lilstucky,False,"This is SUCH a good app compared to Netflix! It has all the shows I love to watch and it’s easy to use! However there are a few things that I think should be fixed. One of them is the adds. I do t have a problem with adds but when they are 80-70 seconds, and about every 4 minutes, they can be really annoying. Another one is the glitches. Whenever I go out of the app, it immediately logs me out so when I go into the app, I have to constantly log in again. Overall, this is SUCH a amazing app! Besides those few issues, it is amazing! I recommend it! 4/5 stars."
2019-12-14 13:32:14,It was better before the adds,3,ed 2346🤪,False,"I had this app before adds came to it, it was SO GREAT I watched it every day, my favorite shows were on the app, and I could binge watch commercial free. I would have given it 5 stars. But then the adds came to the app and now any show I want to watch that’s longer than 20 minutes has 3 or 4 two minute commercial breaks in it. ITS SO ANNOYING! They put a commercial right on a cliffhanger and then I have to watch two minutes of random adds that I’m not even interested in to see my show. I thought I was already paying for the app, and now they even need commercials, take my money and let me watch commercial free. Thank you for reading."
2017-12-12 21:19:21,Such and annoying app,1,G94758362,False,"When I got this app I was excited to watch a bunch of great shows I couldn’t watch anywhere else, but then I tried to do it and I got mad. Whenever I tried to find a show about half the ones I wanted to watch weren’t there which is fine it happens I understand that, but so many of the shows I did find had a bunch of episodes missing. One show had the first part of a two-part episode missing. Also, anytime I tried getting my hands into a comfortable position on my device, or tapped to see how much time was left in my episode and tapped again to make my darkened screen with giant buttons over my episode go away it reminded or fast forwarded and I had to go back to my spot which generally involved watching a set of commercials I’ve already watched."
2017-09-11 06:21:04,Can we get the old app back??,3,ashwins1,False,"At least until all the bugs are worked out and it gets feature parity with the older app. The new UI is meh and we are losing functionality and it's not worth the trade. Apple TV app is especially buggy, I have the ads subscription , so I get ads. It plays ads and then at the end it auto skips to some 10-30 seconds BEFORE the ad break instead of continuing on with the show and then plays the ads AGAIN and then continues (mercifully there's no infinite loop) this is annoying. One more issue  if I go back 10 seconds just after an ad break, it plays the same ads AGAIN! Fix this! The old app had no issues like these."
2020-04-27 13:07:17,I have a glitch,2,THE YOUTUBER NAMED KATIE B.,False,"I have a glitch in the app. Whenever I get off of the app it will just restart the episode. It is really freaking annoying. And if I try to put it back to where I was it will just restart. If you guys and girls don’t fix this glitch I think I might delete the app!! This is really annoying. And if the app didn’t have this glitch I would rate it 4 stars. Another thing that is annoying is that if I slightly press my screen it will move my progress. This app does have potential but if you continue to have these glitches I think I just might delete it! And I really don’t want to do that! So just please work to solving the problems! Thank you!

2019-11-28 16:00:23,My Stuff,3,HoneyBun520,False,"Once I’m all caught up on a series, the show normally went to the bottom of “My Stuff” and was labelled “All Caught Up”. But now, my completed shows are being moved to the top of the category and labelled as if I never watched it at all. Example? I just watched the new episode of Castle Rock, and it’s sitting in the top row of my shows (ahead of things that I haven’t watched) saying that I have 17 unwatched episodes and reset to season 1 episode 1. It’s disgustingly disorganized and not even in alphabetical order. This is the first category I go to in this app, and the fact that I have to sift through it to find actual new episodes doesn’t make the least bit of sense."
2019-04-01 07:30:51,Volume control as well as video player bug.,1,FCrump,False,"Why remove the volume slider? Nothing worse than when streaming from a device to a tv and it is blaring loud since, on the iPhone at least, the volume control is linked to the volume buttons on the phone. Also it would seem that when streaming from an iPhone app to a device, and if you attempt to watch a video on the same device, it will stutter and pause intermittently. As far as I know the video is not streaming on the device but say through my Chromecast, which would mean it’s not say network or bandwidth usage. Then again who knows. It’s not like the app is buggy and sometimes will open with 60 seconds of ads, then the opening to a show followed by 1.5-2 minutes of ads directly afterwards........."
2017-11-05 03:10:47,Maybe let the interns make the UI next time,1,Justindangerpants,False,"Absolutely unusable garbage that makes doing anything 100% harder and more frustrating.  The old interface wasn’t amazing but it was decently thought out and worked well enough to not generate complaints/frustration.  

Nothing works as it should or as expected and finding what shows have new episodes seems like someone went out of their way to hide it.  Why does the (...) lead to a drop down menu that has an option to learn more?  Why doesn’t it just take you to the information for that video? Terrible, terrible design abounds.  

Either go back to the previous interface or hurry up and get a team of UX/UI designers that didn’t just scroll through tumblr for a month and pronounce themselves designers to make a new one."
2018-08-28 00:32:38,I love it but you could do better,5,boogie24k,False,I love the app but I think it was a bad decision to do add on and live tv you already paid to get in the app now you have to pay for movies Think it really was a dumb decision see I’m not putting hate But Netflix doesn’t do that you guys have a whole bunch of movies people are ready to watch them but it really was dumb to do Add on’s and live tv nobody wants to pay for movies they already started a plan to pay monthly nobody wants to pay for other movies not saying I hate the app you guys could do better with Add on’s and live TV 🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾❤️❤️
2019-10-05 19:09:52,Latest update almost unusable,1,sammysonic03,False,"The latest update for the iOS app is pretty bad (I mostly use an iPad Pro). It won’t retain my watch history anymore which means episodes will resume from the beginning and I always have to go into the show’s info to find my place. The bad part about that is the show info is now buried in the new tiled interface which makes navigating super clunky (there used to be easy-to-see buttons for that). But none of that really matters since the app regularly freezes, crashes, and buffers, even with strong WiFi. 

I’m not exaggerating when I say I had none of these issues with the previous version of the app (except for occasional freezes). Not sure what the heck happened with this update but it needs to be fixed asap."
2018-09-04 14:16:56,Fix the app!!!,2,FarTooTall,False,"The latest update has totally screwed up the Keep Watching tab! Instead of prompting for the next episode of a series I watched last, it default to the very last episode of the very last series of a program. The user is now forced to navigate back to the Episodes tab, leave the latest Season, then remember and choose the season you want, enter it, and then try to remember either the next or last episode to watch! This is ridiculous, as the app used to automatically remember and prompt the next episode in the order being watched, whether it is the first time through the series or the nth time!

Roll the user interface back to something intuitive and useful!!!

2020-09-01 20:31:12,It’s great but....,3,GhOsTs_SuRvIvE,False,It’s great and all but the ads are just too much you have to pay like $10 a month to have no ads and if you pay for the ads then you aren’t  going to have any money soWith ads each ad is like a minute and 30 seconds long and it’s super annoying if they were just change the time so it doesn’t take an hour to get back to the actual show you’re watching this apple be amazing the whole system that system thing with this app will be amazing absolutely amazing I’m suggesting this to the creators of who also so if you see this then I suggest changing everything so it doesn’t take seven years to get back to the show

Commercials can be very annoying sometimes. Also, when I’m watching an episode I would like for it to save to where I left off instead it rewinds like 10 mins. Then, when I have to fast forward it I have to watch some commercials to get to the spot I left off. That’s very annoying and time consuming when your really wanting to watch a series. But overall this app is awesome there’s just some things that would make this app the best."
2017-10-19 12:14:35,Come on people,5,01Edward,False,"This new update removed my queue. It's difficult to figure out to remove shows from the watchlist and you have to stroll on and on to find what you actually want to watch. They could have the colors and all to the old layout and been just fine.

I really dislike this new app. After building up the My Stuff queue the auto play feature just plays whatever it feels like it after the show goes off, not the next episode or the next show you selected to watch. I really wish I could delete this update!"
2018-06-04 14:39:35,This app is terrible,1,Jess12889,False,I use this to cast to my chromecast and watch on my tv and I constantly have issues. Its such an inconvenience especially when im trying to work. Whenever I go to pause it or rewind on my phone and i click the episode the app instantly closes out. If im trying to pick up where i left off on an episode of something it makes me start from the beginning of the episode leaving me to fast forward and watch a lot of commercials. I constantly have connection errors that will randomly pop up and force me out of episodes. Right now I cannot even play an episode because its telling me too many users are streaming when its only me and ive gone through and closed out of old devices. I have zero patience for this app and im deleting it. Do not recommend.
2020-08-14 07:21:29,Adding a little more,5,Undftd Scar,False,The app is amazing and I have so much to watch from but there’s a few things I would like to see added. For example a quality adjuster so whenever my video looks bad I can have it set to 1080p all the time. Second would be to click on a button once you’re on your show and you know you’re caught up that allows to press “caught up” if you were to skip a few episodes because you watched it somewhere else like your family’s house. Overall this is an amazing app.
2017-09-25 15:43:15,I tried to give this app a chance,1,Ninamarimori1394,False,"It was doing alright, but before the newest update it kept blocking me from certain shows because of my age, I'm 22, and the year on my account for some reason says 1991 instead of 1994. Every other device lets me watch but my iPhone. This was finally fixed in the newest update, but now I can't even watch anything that isn't on the next or newest list, it's annoying when your show has 26 or more episodes, but you can't tap on any episode you're on, instead you have to wait for the show to just stream on, I was watching a 26 episode show, but after the 22nd episode it went right back to the first, now I have to stream all the way back up because I can't tap on the episode I'm on, please fix this it's very frustrating.."

You should be more like Netflix because they don’t have ANY ads! The worst part is that they randomly pop up and They are SOOO long! And also why are things locked? For instance I was trying to watch Friends the show and when I search it up there is this lock on it! Like what!? I already have a subscription isn’t that enough!!! I just want to watch Friends. And just saying stuff that should have a little improvement just that."
2018-09-29 16:35:25,Works on and off...,4,GabzyLizard,False,"This app is great when it works. But then it decides not to work, and won’t give me anything. It’s frustrating because there doesn’t seem a way to fix it. I’ve got full WiFi access plus data on, I’ve tried shutting off and restarting my phone, I’ve even tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app. It really would be nice if this service were more readily available by phone. It doesn’t seem like too much to ask, the Netflix phone app has never broken down on me like this. Please try to improve the usability of this app, and a lot of people will be very happy."
2018-10-24 20:58:45,Fantastic!,5,Allaboutappleandapps,False,"I have the Live TV package. I really love the experience. The way this app is set up is a refreshing approach that I personally prefer to some of the other streaming apps that feel more like traditional TV. This gives me the movies and shows that are most important to me at the front and center. Of course it also includes the extremely robust on-demand library as well. And let’s not forget that there is support for Apple Single SignOn which is a huge added bonus. There is a lot of value here, and the app and service work great. Terrific job!"
2018-05-21 06:13:25,Where to begin,1,Honest Rare Review,False,This app forecloses EVERY SINGLE time I open it. Gives me a random error and I have to relaunch every single time. I’ve dealt with that and the annoying commercial replays after accidentally fast forwarding but now I can’t even watch a complete episode without issues.   It keeps freezing on the latest show of new girl right at the second commercial mark. Can’t fast forward because if rewinds to the beginning even thought it shows its playing in the middle. I don’t know why I pay for this anymore I’ve had to watch on the corresponding network website or app for different shows many times lately. Not to mention the random downtime’s where I can’t access anything in the app for hours at a time.  Don’t waste your money on a subscription here.
2018-01-24 21:16:38,Seems I’m throwing away my money,2,Tantalizing_Nik,False,"I use to love this app. I’m never home so most watched my tv shows from my phone of tablet during breaks in my day but w/the updates, it’s not as user friendly. The new way of rewinding/fast forwarding is garbage. Too time consuming to search where I left off so often just switch over to my Netflix account to watch something different. It also freezes up more often & sometimes you can’t get your show to play at all. Yes I can watch from my computer but again, I’m never home. Please, please fix the app or we’ll be forced to cancel our subscription until the issues / glitches in the are resolved. I feel like I’m throwing away my money each month. Urgh so frustrating."
2020-04-27 14:12:09,Ok but not great,3,JayCee1220,False,I mostly use the app on my tv and it’s ok but I do have some complaints. Biggest complaint is the app keeps crashing and when I googled it there are complaints over the last few years or so of the same thing. Second biggest complaint is that the amount of screen use at one time is too low for the price. Should be at least 3 screens since most families have at least 3 people (mom dad child). Has a money hungry feel too it. Charging extra for no ads on a paid service is also pretty cheap. With the competition out there I feel like there are better options and I’ll be choosing a different one.
2019-10-25 00:27:54,Live TV is not great for watching sports,2,mattchat89,False,"Events play from the beginning even when not recorded and force long advertisements, so I can’t scroll to live timing until the ads finish. It is common to miss live action because of this and occurs each time I switch between channels. These events are also set to do. It record, but still “records”/plays the entire game from the beginning. It is incredibly annoying. I would not recommend it for flipping between sports. Unfortunately sling no longer has the local fox sports channels that are important to me.

Update: Events don’t play at the beginning anymore just some random point in the game, so that I conveniently end up missing live action switching between games."
2018-10-14 21:41:30,Needs some improvements,5,gus_2507,False,"I like this app, and use very frequently now, but I hate that once I am all caught up on a show, it goes back and says, for example: 48 unwatched , which shouldn’t because I’ve already watched all episodes. Not all shows that I’ve finished do this, usually they’ll say “All caught up” which is great. But it just annoys me to see that one show that doesn’t do that like the others. I have ocd and just want it to look organized and perfect. I feel like I’m making a big deal out of it, but this just feels important."
2017-11-20 06:11:14,SO ANNOYING!,5,lmtok85,False,Ok so I hate this app after the last update. You’re in the middle of a show and accidentally touch your screen and it jumps forward or backwards a ton. Then you have to spend more time watching extra advertisements which is stupid you have to do that in the first place. Then you got to find your place again and watch another extra advert...  I never bother to review apps but this one is so annoying with the latest update I wouldn’t recommend wasting your monthly money. Sign up with Netflix! I’m going to switch back! 😡
2018-10-02 11:18:06,New App is the worst,1,Lindseymcdoug,False,"Your new app is the worst. I have a bunch of shows in my stuff, shows where I have watched every episode of but all of a sudden with the latest update it says “100 unwatched episode” even though I watched them, you can see the white line at the bottom that the episode has been watched. Since your stupid app can’t tell I watched the first three seasons it won’t tell me when there is a new episode and I no longer get the “all caught up” marking. This isn’t just happening with a few shows in my stuff it is happening with ALL THE SHOWS. This is so annoying because to see if there are new episodes I have to go to the show page, navigate through the seasons and scroll to see if there is a show without the white bar at the bottom. FIX YOUR APP!"
2017-12-13 09:07:02,Horrible Udate,1,Towersbla,False,"Let me start off by saying I NEVER write reviews. So I am not the user who goes around bad mouthing apps. 
So, I am not particularly tech savvy, but I can maneuver through technology intuitively, and I can confidently say that this update is absolute garbage. Pretty much everything has already been said but the change that has been driving me completely bonkers is the scrubbing. This sensitive as heck feature has me watching a million ads, and when I can get through them, I have to scrub to my original spot, then rewatch the same ads, all to have the audio work, but no visual. I’m not gonna hold my breath for a change though, as I can see that this complaint has been stated in reviews repeatedly for at least a couple of months. Write reviews people!! Squeaky wheel gets the oil!"
2017-12-01 07:31:34,BRING BACK THE OLD VERSON,1,Hannah183828,False,"Worst update! Instead of making the streaming easier for your customers, you’re making it more difficult and complex than it needs to be. The older version was simple, and everything was easier to find. This so called “update” tries to grasp a more mobile interface (even the apps on tv if you have the smart tv) worst of all, my TVs automatically updated so it has this version.  And it’s not like I can reverse back.  Fonts are also bigger...therefore two-three tv show titles take up the whole screen (mind you I have a relatively decent not too big or small 60” in the bedroom) as opposed to having multiple thumbnails of tv shows/movies shown at once. This is like when Windows 8 came out, and almost everyone hated it! PLEASE change it back"
2018-03-08 17:55:47,Not loving the update,5,katelynhallie,False,"I’ve never reviewed an app before. I used to love the app, but this recent update is maddening. I loved being able to see the main screen with shows in my list and suggestions. I don’t like the single show view that I have to click through to get to show page, etc. worst of all is the fast forward, rewind. Why make this functional over the entire screen? It is too easy to touch the screen and lose your place. In the very least, make this accessible only through the timeline."
2020-05-19 11:56:53,This app is garbage,1,hulu Suc ks,False,"If you can manage to sift through all the bull crap to find your show, good luck having it actually load it. I have to exit out of the app multiple times because it’s “having trouble playing this title”. If it works, have fun sitting through ad after ad. It starts with an ad, has an ad after the intro, has an ad a few minutes after that, an ad a few minutes after, and so on. In a 20 minute long episode I consistently get 5 ads, typically 90sec long, which is actually longer because of the sometimes ridiculous wait time for the ad to load. To top off the constant ads, they are low quality and sound like your speakers are destroyed. I have great internet that has no issues with any other streaming service."
2019-11-11 10:52:54,Horribly Stupid App,1,p_alex95,False,"This app usually doesn’t acknowledge when I’m done watching an episode and shows that the last few moments are left. Then it shows that a new episode is coming even though the next episode should be available (example: I watched episode 4, episode 5 should already be available but only shows episode 6 as the upcoming episode). And when I go to watch the next episode of a show I’m watching, it’ll bring me to the next episode but not play and stay on the show cover picture unless I actually hit the play button (Example: I watched the second episode of American Dad and hit play next episode, it’ll bring up the the American Dad picture and not play unless I hit the play button). This entire app is dumb as sugar honey iced tea!!!!"
2018-09-29 09:24:49,Rewinds itself,1,skp012,False,"I pay $45 a month to watch my favorite shows. Its bad enough that I still gotta watch every ad on the content despite paying so much. Past couplke months, its been worse. When I’m finished watching the ad and finally the episode starts, after no more than 30 seconds, it rewinds itself a minute or so. Now because of that, I have to see the ad again. Again 30 seconds after the ad finishes, it rewinds again and makes me watch the ad again and again. This is so frustrating. I have not been able to watch a single episode because of that. I want my money back. In full. For the last couple months. I can make the video of it and upload it if you want. But this is so annoying. I would have given 0 stars if I could."
2018-08-26 01:03:53,As bad as it got they managed to make it worse,1,Bogart Humphrey,False,"End of program, it forces into playing a random up next item not of my choosing. Back does not work. No way to back out it. Have to entirely close and reopen app just to avoid a program I did not choose and do not want to watch. I’m just going to cancel my subscription. Had a good thing going. Not sure what happened, but the aside for the UI / UX foibles, attempting to force me into content I have no interest in just won’t fly.

Latest update brings new issues including non responsive full screen on a fairly regular basis. Jump forward, then back more than once and the video disappears. Audio continues to roll. Have to close out app and reopen. Inside a single program have to close and reopen 1-2 times consistently."
2018-05-05 04:11:39,Frustrated,2,raemills4,False,"Very frustrating update. I only updated because my iPad and phone gave me messages saying that “I had reached the limit of devices being played...” So I updated. And lost every single show I have ever saved/watched/etc. I had to go back in and add shows that I’m currently watching, but now all the old shows I’ve watched are back at the top, automatically playing (I realize I need to turn the auto play function off). So instead of having all current shows, with their new episodes, showing up in one spot, I’m scrolling down a page of every single show I’ve ever watched to try to sort through to the ones that are current. Bleh. I guess I’ll keep my eye out for another update."
2020-02-04 00:53:03,Happy with the content but has bugs,4,RLaRogue,False,"I’ve been happy with the content, and I usually don’t mind the commercials that come with the discounted rate, but sometimes I’ll get “error loading” conveniently AFTER the commercials played just fine so I’m stuck restarting the app and watching the same commercials again and again until it will load. Additionally, when you stop watching something and resume watching later - be it a day later or an hour later - it rewinds by a LOT. I always find myself having to fast forward to where I really left off."
2019-11-15 03:10:04,So many issues,2,mslifer,False,At first I blamed our Internet service but that isn’t the issue. If you cast a recorded show the device you are casting from becomes a paperweight unless you want it to stop or go rogue and start playing whatever during playback. So frustrating to be watching a recorded show during a time when another starts recording so the one you are watching just stops. Just as frustrating to click the Start from the beginning option just to have it go to the live location. We gave up cable so we’d have more options and freedom from frustration. Not sure we found it using this app. If all this is because of the app - I can only hope someone is working on it.
2017-10-02 22:01:28,Horrible update,1,Msteeereerr,False,"I appreciate the 10 second skip ahead, but if you tap the screen it takes you to the middle or end of a show, or movie. 
It literally ruined a movie I watched. I had just began to watch a movie after the update. I went back a few seconds. I went too far, so I thought Id use the cool new forward feature. I didn't know at the time, but all of a sudden I saw people together kissing as a couple, and other things going on that was previously showing them with other partners..? 
So, before I noticed -- it had skipped to the end of the movie. So, after getting it back in position, the movie was unwatchable, due to knowing the ending. 
And to ""search"" a show or movie is horrible. Nothing about it makes sense. 
I may just drop this app altogether"
2019-07-26 06:01:39,"Fix your app, Seriously!",1,Luiisito C.,False,"I wonder if people are just blind or if these 1M reviews are paid, because oh god, it is terrible. The interface of the app is good in the view side of things, but how it performs or works, is just not there yet. Is if like the app limits us and only shows us what the app wants. Also every time I want to see a show, for some reason it pops up an error and every time have to be turning off my iPad or closing the app for the show to start. If that wasn’t enough, subtitles are messed up, every time an episode ends, I have to go to setting and enable it again because apparently is not working as it should. I gave up I waited a year for you guys to fix and still. But well, the wait train is here I guess, but I’m not paying until it happens."
2019-02-27 02:30:04,This app is amazing my kids loved it!,5,unicornpuppy$parkle,False,"I just got the membership and my kids loved this app. It gives people tv shows and movies in hd content. My youngest kid loved watching teen titans go in it, he said it was better than the live tv we used to have. My second staged kid loved watching family guy on it, she said that it was good and it was fast. My oldest kid loved watching grey atonomy on it, she said that it was cool and had lots of tv shows and movies about people who are interested in medical stuff. So overall we thought this was a good app so I recommend this app to you."
2019-06-25 20:30:15,Fix bug,4,💝Pooh💝,False,"I have this bug that happens whenever I go back 10 seconds or go forward 30 and I’m next to a commercial it automatically goes to a commercial even if I’ve watched the commercial the show was providing. This is not fair to the viewer at all. I don’t understand why I have to see 3 more commercials if I’ve already seen them before, just because I missed something. Instead of making us watch commercials all over again you should allow us to go through the commercial and then delete the commercial mark after we’ve seen it."
2019-05-21 02:55:36,HUGE problems on iPad,2,jsdhfg,False,"So I’ve been trying to watch HIMYM on my iPad for hours and I will get through one episode then the show will crash and in order to restart I have been shown a message “press & hold to stream” and after pressing down on many parts of the screen still face loading errors and a lack of response from the show and the server. 

I contacted support via chat and they had no clue that such a message was even able to pop up on a screen through their server and just told me to reinstall the app. I have reinstalled multiple times and still face this issue. 

Great shows on here but horrible streaming. The ability to stream to all devices needs to be fixed."

2019-02-26 15:46:24,Keeps marking what I’ve watched as unplayed and it’s driving me insane,1,karmabox,False,"This app used to keep track of episodes watched (even across all platforms) so that new ones show up in my queue and I can see that, hey, there a new episode this week! and go straight to it. Over the past few weeks, I’ve tried skipping ahead to trigger it as ‘played’ but it only works a couple of times before the whole thing craps out, uninstalling / reinstalling, and asking for help online. If you guys have to pay the licensor or network each time we watch something, wouldn’t it make sense to let us, at the very least, manually mark an episode as played? As it stands, I can’t get to the episodes I want to see when I want to see them and everything is a jumbled, unwatchable mess."
2017-09-28 20:36:39,New interface is terrible.,1,kittykins20,False,"I feel like now my commercial time has doubled because for some reason my auto play feature goes back a few episodes each time instead of going to the next episode. It’s also difficult to use because if you touch the screen by accident it will rewind the program, then it will play more commercials before you can put back to where you were in the program. I also don’t like the new lineup situation. It was so much easier when you could see more of everything on one screen. I hate that now to watch something I have to search under more of these categories to find what I want to watch (I don’t search for it because I can’t quite think of the name of the show/movie to begin with)."
2020-10-09 17:42:26,Picture in Picture suddenly gone?,2,ifyoureseeingthisitstoolate,False,"I’ve had my fair share of issues with this app. From not being able to watch half the content I wanted, to the app crashing almost regularly for a while but I was able to overlook that. I don’t like to waste time complaining about things that will probably be fixed eventually but, I don’t know, this was the last straw for me. Since I updated to IOS 14 I’ve been using picture in picture with no problem and I’ve been in love with it. Suddenly, I decide to update and it’s just gone? I’m so sick of the back and forth problems with this app. It’s like it’s never ending!!! I love hulu’s content but what’s the point if I can almost never watch it!"
2018-10-18 01:30:41,Needs fixes,5,Printscess,False,I use the app on my iPad. Despite me having watched entire seasons of shows it still lists them as unwatched. But if you go to series details you can clearly see that I have watched all of the shows so there are some problems.  For example I have watched years of Law and order SVU but since the update it tells me I have hundreds of episodes to watch. That is for almost every single one of the shows I watch. Not to mention if you go online and watch an episode things don’t lineup. Very frustrated
2017-09-26 21:02:46,Hate the update,5,B Linder,False,"For some reason, ever since the update happened I'm not able to watch my shows on my tv. I can hear it but the picture doesn't come through. It's not my tv because I can see the flip tray on my tv just no picture of the show. & it's not my cable either because I can still watch Netflix with no problem. I had no problems with it before the update either. It'll come on for just a few seconds then disappear. So whatever was done. I wish it would undo! Very disappointed."
2018-06-25 02:20:03,Constantly buffers.,1,IkindaWantMyMoneyBack,False,"I can’t even enjoy watching a show because this app is constantly buffering. I can watch Netflix with no issue but I constantly buffer even in low video settings with this app. Sometimes I even get a message on the screen saying there is a problem but then it will play but leave the message on the screen. I can’t get rid of the message without closing out the show and then having to wait for it to buffer all over again. And since this last update, I haven’t been able to watch a single episode of any show without this happening. Very disappointed and almost feel like demanding a refund. I haven’t hardly been able to use the stinkin’ app yet I’m paying each month for the commercial free option."
2020-01-03 18:08:15,Ads,4,rainbowreview,False,"I’ve watched an ad at the same mark 3 times now. One because I was in the middle of watching the show. Then I paused it and left and it refreshed. Then I had to watch the ad again. Then right after that ad was done, I accidentally swiped out of the show and it’s making me watch the ad again. Is there a way for the ads to be more, I don’t know, intelligent? It’s really annoying, especially if you accidentally do something and then your forced to watch the ad again. Please fix this. Other than that, I love the variety of shows and movies that you have."
2017-09-17 20:04:02,New viewing format has got to go!,1,marmalade fox,False,"Can I just say that I absolutely hate the new viewing format after the app has been updated......how many times now that I have tried pressing the rewind function, only for it to play back where I maybe have touched someplace else on the screen and then another 4 advertisements play before my show is back on. WASTE OF TIME!!!!!!! 

Update: Seriously, this is so frustrating!!!, having to sit through another 120seconds of advertisements just because I didn't touch the Rewind-10 button correctly or accidentally touched a random part of the screen....makes me think about cancelling use of this app altogether. In reading some of these recent reviews, it is clear that this is also an issue for other users."
2018-12-14 18:53:40,Least favorite streaming app,3,Henrycakes,False,"Paying for a service and still having advertisements is just plain annoying as it is but the app itself hardly works! If I press play after pausing a show, the show starts from the beginning and on top of that, it makes you watch advertisements, you’ve already watched, over again. Then sometimes the sound just randomly stops working (this happens on all our devices) the only way to get it back is to close out the app and then guess what?...It starts your show from the beginning and makes you watch the same advertisements all over again."
2019-11-15 02:36:50,Awful and frustrating,2,*B*lucky 13,False,"Why in the actual hell does this app suggest i “resume an episode” that is already finished. The only way to get through to the next suggested episode to start over or fast forward. Removing something from your continue to watch history removals all episodes previously watched. Are you stupid??? Most viewing systems allow you to mark something as played and move on. Thank the lord I’m not paying for this crap. 

I shouldn’t have to watch commercials from Hulu’s boring advertisements just to find my original spot in a show. I abhor this system. When you close out mid segment it reverts back to the beginning just to show a commercial. Screw you sneaky people."
2018-09-28 14:47:41,Randomly Freezes,2,Josephwweaver,False,"Thank God , I’m receiving the service for free through sprint, this service is not worth paying for.  The app freezes and I’m on the second day of video playback errors.  When I try to watch episodes, and some seasons are missing the first half. For example episode 1 to 18 will be missing while 19 to 21 are there.  Why would anyone pay for half a show.   The amount of commercials they show is ridiculous.  Netflix and network apps are way cheaper and show less commercials.   If you want to pay for half a show and advertising this is definitely the service for you, and if you want value for your money, I would probably look elsewhere."
2018-01-17 14:20:50,Awful Interface,2,NetsiMagoo,False,"Why do you put the “Watch Again” shows at the top?  You need to bump new shows up instead of making me scroll down through all the shows I already watched!  Also, some shows are so quiet I can’t hear them unless I am sitting on top of my device or wear headphones.  Others are so loud everyone in the house can hear them.  Finally, why do you pick random shows to queue up next?  If I’m busy getting ready for work, why can’t you play the next show from my Keep Watching list?  I don’t want to watch Charlie Rose or Desperate Housewives!  Bad algorithm there... I’ve been paying for this subscription for a long time but I’m shocked to see a two star average rating for this app!"
2018-01-30 04:24:33,Double Audio,1,Jpman1989,False,I can barely watch one show without the audio restarting and overlapping the sound already playing. A show will start and then flash for a second and then the audio would not be synced right and I would hear the show playing double. Half is playing ahead than the video and the other half is behind. It’s like hearing the show delayed on two TVs played right next to each other.  I have to keep restarting the video or closing out of the app all together and try again. And if it does start working properly it messes up at the beginning of the next show prompting me to go through the tedious task of trying to fix the sound again. I cant watch a series without having to do this. Defeats the purpose of auto play...
2020-01-29 07:52:36,BUGGY,2,Hoochiegonzales,False,"This app is buggy af (chromecast user). First is the connection between tv and phone - which is usually a disaster since you can rarely use your phone while casting to your tv. If you turn to turn the volume up on your phone it will blast the tv volume, also they have somehow made it impossible for you to run your video while the app is running (so if you are playing something on tv, you cannot open your video to record anything). Also to mention the forward and back, you can’t move the cursor freely so go back to certain parts where you might have left off, you have to use the dumb 10s back or 30s forward. It’s becoming very frustrating to use"
2017-10-16 13:59:35,New design horrid and you know it,1,R3volutionV,False,"I can’t fathom why they haven’t listened to feedback yet. They must know the new interface is unusable. I purposefully turned off my iPhone’s auto-update just so I could avoid updating to this terrible new interface in hopes they would fix it before I had to update. However, I was forced to update it when I started having issues and the videos wouldn’t work correctly. It’s to be expected but I am about to cancel my subscription if they don’t do something soon.

I can’t easily scroll through shows I watch, just let me look at more than one show at a time. Plus, if I have a new episode, the new icon will go away in only a few days. For the love of god, just make the interface more user friendly please."
2020-10-06 21:48:27,No live on ISO,1,Sonimck,False,"I can’t watch anything considered “live tv” on my phone anymore. It keeps saying I have to open the app at home every 30 days. I have tried for days to do this and am still can’t. I have open, closed, logged in, logged out and deleted app to start again. It’s not even live TV I’m trying to watch just shows only available with my live tv content. Im definitely not happy to be paying this much and not be able to use. Netflix is working perfectly so we know it’s not the cellular/WiFi or phone bent an issue. It now never remembers where you left off and rewinding is a no as it will error out. It keeps giving me weak or no signal messages which makes no sense cause everything else works and streams. Please fix ..."

That’s how deeply I feel about the content this app has to offer. Hands down, the best content for the money spent in relation to streaming services. I feel the extra $2 is worth an ad free viewing experience. I love that I can watch newer shows like Modern Family and The Simpsons as well as older shows like I Love Lucy and The Golden Girls in the same place. As long as the content continues, so will I."
2019-05-16 03:39:07,People stop your complaining about the ads!,4,Cheryl014,False,"Okay I need to vent a little bit. This is for those people who are complaining about having commercials...YOU SIGNED UP FOR THE VERSION THAT HAS COMMERCIALS IF YOU DON’T WANT IT THEN CHANGE YOU’RE FREAKIN PLAN TO COMMERCIAL FREE!!!!

Okay sorry. Now for those who actually want a review of the app and it is a great app. However sometimes when I’m watching a show it occasionally brings up a very well worded error document. No I have not read it yet and that is because I don’t read I need to save that amount of time to binge watch Brooklyn Nine-Nine. It is very annoying but it is still a good app"
2018-10-24 22:33:02,The ads oh my lord,3,Allyn Todd,False,"This is a good high quality app, but Jesus the ads are insane. If you go back ten seconds right after an ad, sometimes it will play the 80 ad break again in full. Sometimes if you touch the screen wrong it will start seeking, and god forbid you go back to before the last break, because sure enough you'll get to sit through the same 80 second ad again. Don’t forget you’ll have to scrub back to where you were before you accidentally went back, because that’s another 80 ad break. At this point I’ve forgotten what show I’m watching. Everything else is good though I give it a 3 outta 5. It’s no SMB2"
2018-04-23 01:33:51,Least usable entertainment app out there,1,Mitchk18181818181,False,"Where do I even begin? The user interface is not intuitive at all. Even finding shows I just watched a week ago is an exercise in frustration. Poor search feature, poor user recommendations and poor layout overall. Now let’s get to how buggy it is. Half the time I open the app a show won’t load properly, even after closing out and reopening the app numerous times. When the show does work, the same Ads run 4 times in a row, then it will restart a previous segment of the show I’ve already just watched! Everyone I know is complaining about the same things, yet each new update fails to address the issue. Terrible terrible app. Will not be renewing when subscription ends soon."
2017-11-08 15:42:53,So many things wrong,1,Magness123,False,"The first thing open is a lineup of shows you want me to watch? Seriously? Show the shows I am watching first THEN do a line up. And show them on a single plane, not having to swipe up and down. Searching it more difficult than in the previous version as well. The thing that is even worse is the slide to change where you are in the episode. It’s too sensitive if I just tap and my finger is on the screen for longer than .05 of a second it will skip to a different point in the episode and I have to pretty much reload it and figure out where I left off. This app is not user friendly in the slightest and it’s so disappointing that you have the best streaming service but make it so difficult to use."
2017-10-08 16:48:48,Scrub navigation is terrible,1,Horseradish-House,False,"I've never written a review on the App Store before, but the new tap to fast forward/rewind navigation on this app is one of the worst pieces of design I've ever seen. So easy to accidentally rewind to the beginning of an episode with an accidental tap, and then you have to sit through commercials again to get back to your spot (multiple rounds if you're not sure where you were exactly). 

I've also accidentally fast-forwarded without realizing (it happened while I was trying to use the 10-second forward function, so I just thought it was a new scene) and missed entire sections of an episode. Only realized this happened when I accidentally rewinded to that part when trying to use the 10-second back button."
2020-10-02 01:28:38,My complaint,3,Saucedo Y.S,False,My complaint is sometimes when you watching a show and is on English and you go on the next episode if I changes to a different language and it’s not English anymore and it dose not show if we can change it back to English on audio that got me a bit mad! So I would like it if I did not do that and you can change it to English Spanish or any language your chose I would like that fixed because I don’t like it like it’s on English and then when I go on the next episode it on Spanish or something and I can’t change it to English because it get me mad so please fix that! And it dose that a lot to me.
2020-06-04 21:40:13,Bugs!!!!!,4,Luis905,False,The app alone is fine works great sometimes a bit laggy to switch tabs. One major issue I’m having not sure if others too is during a show I’m watching right before a ad starts it appears to have an issue where the show continues in mute for at least 5 seconds and countdown of the ad starts then suddenly the ad begins once the ad is over or at least the countdown the the ad continues for 5 seconds or so then the show pops back up it’s annoying and tends to start annoying you more and more this has to get fixed.
2019-08-02 17:35:28,"Good app, but . . .",4,Xdser,False,". . . there are several issues that annoy me, such as crashing at in opportune moments, not loading, telling me to check my internet connection, in spite of the fact that I have a strong connection.  The thing that annoys me most is that when I am binge-watching a show, and have turned on close captioning, it seems to turn itself off for each show. I go to turn it on, and it says that it is already on. But it isn’t. So I have to turn it off and back on in order for it to work. Please fix this! Other than these issues, good app."
2019-02-24 09:40:03,Good Old Shows,5,🥶💯SsJRa'shon🤙🏾💨,False,"The App 🤙🏾💯Amazing But I just don’t find myself on it as much because there aren’t any good shows on there besides the 100+ I’ve already seen I mean a decent update of new shows like The Arrow, Flash , Justice league unlimited, Teen Titans... The good stuff Like Cat Scratch , Jimmy 2 shoes , Kid vs Katt , Avatar the last airbender , Stuff that takes me back and others too like some good Stuff like Disney Nickelodeon Cartoon Network Back in the day Even Krypto the super dog , A pup named Scooby doo ,Yin Yang Yo ,( I am now hitting the dark corners of my mind ) 😭😭 But in all Good Oldies would be a nice touch"
2018-12-30 11:08:47,I miss the British selection that was in its own category.,3,".,"",)999",False,The format is quite confusing. I would like to see small individual choices on one screen as opposed to having to scroll through out the process to find a movie and then it repeats itself when I know there are other movies to be seen. So it’s as if I’m at a scavenger hunt looking for things I know are on the site but yet somehow .hidden Unbothered once again by the fact that I have to come up with a nickname that is not my own which is what I need in order to submit this review and I’ll never remember this nickname or write another review because I can’t remember the nickname
2018-03-14 01:04:55,Unintuitive user interface,2,Elzarth,False,"Ignoring the fact that the menus are pretty obtuse and difficult to navigate, the worst problem is the fast-forward/rewind controls. 
As others have stated, if you press ANYWHERE on the screen in the darkened “pause mode” the video will skip to that section. Why isn’t this limited to the time bar on the bottom of the screen? If I miss the pause button then it skips 20 minutes ahead and I have to watch the ads TWICE before I can go back to where I was in the video. I don’t get frustrated easily, but this is infuriating. 

However, I do like the feature that allows you to search by episode title. Please just fix the other VERY annoying issue!"
2020-05-05 21:40:36,What happened to the animes?! ( ͠° ͟ʖ ͡°) (and why does it show me the same ad),4,sailsofsilk,False,"I just came here to say, there is this show called Haikyu!!, it’s an anime. There would normally be like 4 seasons but now there is only 2.

I know, some of you might be like “Just get Crunchyroll!” or whatever but I’m just wondering. If I could get the creator to reply that might be helpful. I’m just wondering what happened because I just love the animes on this app.

Also the ads, it keeps showing me the same freaking ads!!! “Go get goodrx!!!“ “Get a car!!!“ “You can still be in touch!!!“ like no. Stop. I hate these ads."
2020-03-14 16:08:41,"Crashes regularly, full of bugs",1,KoowanPStark,False,"Absolutely atrocious app. How in the world does one of the biggest streaming services keep failing to fix this broken, unstable and bug-filled app? It has been updated several times and still routinely stalls, crashes and freezes. In addition, the  interface goes blank and loses the list of episodes,  or it stops playing unless you do a hard reset. Many shows won’t automatically play the next episode, others can’t be watched at all because the app gives an “Error 1” and stops working. Seriously, if this app was released by some unknown company it would have been pulled from the App Store for being a beta version. When are they EVER going to fix this piece of junk?"
2019-08-15 05:01:17,Weird glitches,3,brbrbrbb rrbr,False,"My main problem and the reason I’m writing this review is because the episodes tab has disappeared from one of the shows in My Stuff? When I click on it it shows the episode I’m currently on, and then Extras and You May Also Like. There is no Episodes tab so I have to manually search it up. This is an issue only with one show (Brooklyn Nine-nine 🥰), but it’s also the show I watch most on here and it’s realllllly annoying to have to search up the episodes as I go. 
Another thing: sometimes when I have perfectly fine connection, y’all take issue with it anyways and crash. Stop it"
2019-03-15 06:13:01,Just extra for no reason,2,Jneruda,False,"Tec support is really difficult to get to. You know they make you register before you contact them, as if having a monthly subscription doesn’t entitle you enough to contact them regarding issues. And get this, they even make your put your job title down -_- Does that determine how quickly they’ll respond or how seriously they’ll take your concerns. Kinda weird. 

And not all titles show up when you explore. There are shows that you have to manually type in for them to come up. Additionally, I’ve had trouble watching some shows on my laptop, but not on my phone. The trouble isn’t with loading or anything, but with Hulu’s interface. 

All around, I’m getting tired of this platform and how difficult they make it to contact them for support. I’ll definitely be ending my subscription after my month ends. Plus you’ll get tired of their options pretty fast. 

Y’all shouldn’t pay for subscriptions such as these as there are many websites that offer all these shows/movies for free. Up to you."
2018-11-14 21:43:17,Why do I pay so much to still have commercials,5,Halphonso,False,It infuriates me that I pay the highest amount to not have commercials to still get these “advertisements” when I’m watching my shows. yes I can fast-forward through it but I paid to not have that there so why is it still there and why am I paying? And really good way to say that I’m not getting commercials by calling it an advertisement. I find I got less advertisements and commercials with the limited commercials package then I am with the no commercials
2018-12-28 06:54:02,Poor quality watched episodes tracking,3,TasaPNW,False,"Frustrated by this app, both on my ipad and on Apple TV. I had to stop playing an episode for an emergency. When I tried to go back and pick it up where it left off, the ipad version had a “keep watching” option but it wasn’t the correct episode, and on the Apple TV app I couldn’t even find an option for “keep watching” at all. And how in the heck do you get to see a list of all the episodes available for a particular program? Altogether, a poorly organized app. Doesn’t do much good to have a big variety of programs if there’s no logical organization do the app."
2018-03-22 06:14:38,Why does everyone keep voting one star?,5,Extrord123454321,False,"I personally enjoy this app and hoe the features work, however  one of the more recent updates made it so the layout changed. Sure we were all surprised but if we actually tried to do something about it it would actually work. Some people may complain about trivial things that have an easy fix for example:

I can’t skip to the correct time and i miss 95 percent of my movie! 

Is a problem some people have when they swipe on the screen taking you to that part, which is an easy fix. Just swipe back to where you were and don’t constantly flick the screen every two seconds!

I personally believe that as an active society we could actually do something about the problems in this app ( which might i mention ALL apps have problems) compared to just complaining about it for literally no point"
2018-05-25 20:36:08,Problems with this app for months,1,Hollyrahel,False,"I suspended my monthly payments and should have left it that way. Past few days it will not let me cast to my tv. The only reason I even have to do that is because this app is the only one out of all the apps in the world that we can not rewind or fast forward on big screen. You can from phone but not on tv . Then before the casting quit working altogether I had to go in and out of the app at least three times for it to even cast . Now no options to even cast ! Same problems different year . This is getting ridiculous. Why are the rewind and ff issues not been dealt with yet ?? Everyone complains about it and just nothing being done. Netflix has been, and will remain, the best streaming service"
2017-10-26 16:06:42,Terrible video player,5,DaniellexElaine,False,"The new video player is really bad. The screen is way too sensitive and I’m constantly finding myself jumping ahead in the show I’m watching and taking forever to get back to the location I was on. I pay for add free and can't imagine what those people with commercials go through. The rest of the features are fine I guess, but the player needs to be fixed. I also hate that the screen goes dark when skipping ahead or back a few seconds. Please fix it"
2017-11-08 02:06:16,Kinda sad but happy,4,TheApocalypseReviewer,False,"Love everything about your app. But three adds in 30 seconds seriously? Its stupid when you hardly tap the screen and it shifts the entire video back. And you have to watch a add before skipping back to were you are that Is if you even remember, then you have to watch another 90 second add... can you guys fix the tap function so it doesn't skip everytime. No one likes this feature. Trust me. I listen to all my friends at school bickering about that. Even my dad and sister hate that feature. Trust me, you'd be rated higher if you did"
2017-11-06 05:59:12,Least user friendly app ever,1,LeifOdoyle,False,"First the good:
The content is much better, and more diverse than Netflix's short list of B-C rated movies and shows that nobody has heard of.

The bad:
The way that the tabs are set up is terrible, it is unnecessarily tedious to find your way to the episode menu, and when you do it goes to the most recent season, not the one you are currently watching.

And the ugly:
I cannot overstate this... THE FF/RW INTERFACE IS THE SLOPPIEST DESIGN FLAW SINCE THE EXHAST PORT ON THE DEATH STAR!!!! It is so stupid, when you touch ANYWHERE on the screen from the control interface while watching the show it immediately jumps to that spot, and when you try to find your way back to your spot, since it doesn't preview where you are skipping to you have to tap around on the screen like a three-year-old playing friggin flappy-bird until you either find your spot, or give up and get so angry with this being a daily struggle, you go onto the App Store to leave a scathing multi-paragraph rant as a review... which is exactly what just happened.

TL;DR
Great content, the app interface is worse than windows xp, with a mashed potato smeared on the motherboard."
2020-07-22 21:31:54,Love it but kinda want the ads to stop.,5,zelda fan kyra,False,"Okay yeah I gave it a 5 star rating, but that’s only because I love the software and use it a lot. So as I said the ads in this. I know that they help the sponsor of the show make money but the ad breaks are kinda long and annoying. I would feel better if the ad breaks were 1 or 2 ads or if I could be able to skip them if they are long ad breaks. That would be really nice! So this wasn’t exactly the longest review but yeah. Thanks for listening to my suggestions and opinions."
2020-08-31 03:34:39,Works but it has some big issues for me,2,bstoneaz,False,"This is specifically in reference to the Apple TV app:
1.  Subbed anime is messed up.   Auto subtitles does not work so when you want to switch apps you have to change the darned subtitle setting since it’s a global setting.   Second, even with it turned on, after an ad it sometimes stops showing subtitles and forces a stop out of the show to fix it.   Also too many ads for a short anime episode.
2.  The audio is stereo for everything.   Really poor streaming option for home theater owners.   The other providers usually have good to very good surround options.
On a fire stick sometimes it hangs instead of playing an ad"
2020-07-07 22:59:30,Ready to switch,3,2bglmom,False,"It’s nice to have live streaming and favorite shows, but not when it doesn’t work! Since the latest update, there have been numerous times when the app doesn’t load. I delete it and reinstall and works until the next time I want to use it. We have had other issues as well where it keeps repeating the last few seconds. I should not have to keep deleting and reinstalling to grt this to work. The subscription just renewed, but for the next month, I’ll be looking for another streaming app unless you can get this one to work! It’s not worth the trouble for the price!"
2018-10-19 17:30:07,Keeps getting stuck!!!!!,1,Catwithasea,False,"Soooo annoying!!! I've been trying to watch a show on this app, but it keeps freezing! I tried updating the app and restarting my iPad and it keeps getting stuck. It won't fast forward or rewind once stuck. I'm closing it and watching my Prime Video service instead. The Prime app is infinitely better.

Update: noticed and downloaded the new update on 10/17...still....freezing!!! My internet speed is not the issue. Netflix and Prime work just fine. When I close the app to try watching again, it takes me right back to the very beginning of the episode and forces me to watch commercials in order to try to find the spot I was at before it froze. Then it freezes at that same spot. I give up. Lousy app."
2018-04-14 04:55:24,Annoying app,2,Mike in Cypress,False,"There are several irritating things about this app. Pause/play/ff/rwd, etc. Layout when looking to watch. Give users control of their layout! We shouldn't have to scroll through pages to get to a list of movies or programs. Why can't we just see everything on one list under each header? There are 12 sub-headers under ""more movies"" give a ""see all"" option. What's popular with me may not be what's popular with others! I don't care about staff picks! Just give an alphabetical list option for each section! There are just too many hoops to jump through to get to programming, whether it's tv, movies, or whatever the viewer is looking for. Simplicity please!"
2019-07-19 04:04:45,Really good but a few things bug me,5,MurpleBibi,False,"It’s overall a very good app but when I wanna search for a show it just shows the episodes and movies. Another thing is when I look for, let’s say anime, I won’t find it there so I think “Oh, it’s not here” but when I choose a show to watch it will recommend me the anime I was looking for. Then when I look for it in the anime genre, it’s not there. Please add this feature and fix your genres. It will help me and (probably) other people find what they want to watch."
2020-05-24 07:42:13,Spongebob please,4,it's dad im still gettin milk,False,I love this app but I wish it had Spongebob. That would make it a 100 times better(Quarantine has been making me miss my childhood). I do really enjoy this app. There’s tons of different show and movies I have been watching since quarantine started. I can’t hangout with others right now so my friends and I have been watching the same show and texting each other about our favorite parts and characters. I’ve also went back to a couple shows that I didn’t finish since I have more time on my hands. This app is amazing.👍
2019-08-31 19:31:39,Solved 2 problems!,4,evelyn7221,False,"Looks like the screen no longer stays on after a video has stopped playing and the app goes back to the previous menu despite any ipad screen lock settings! Thank you

It also looks like you can play though the last episode of a show you already watched elsewhere after adding it to your watch list, and the app will drop the show to the bottom of your watch list to wait for new episodes! Not exactly the “mark as watched” button I long for, but a huge improvement. Thanks again"
2019-05-17 22:56:28,commercials🙄,5,Mati_sunshine,False,"Just wish there were less commercials. I know everyone probably saying this. But I pay a little more than Netflix for this and I have commercials. There are different shows and I love that but I don’t want to pay more for more commercials. And you can’t be profiting too much more from them cause you chargin more than Netflix and more current shows. Idk. Just a thought and suggestion! Or maybe just shorter commercials??

Still appreciate the app though! Of course!"
2017-12-09 18:07:53,Downgrade.,4,SamuraiArtGuy,False,"While the prettify interface is all shiny and mobile-appy, and is very visually appealing. It is a actual and significant downgrade in user functionality. It has become much more tedious to browse content, and more tedious and time consuming to navigate to our own playlists. And who thought it was a good idea to eliminate genres and sub-genres as a browsing feature? We HATE that. This was a primary way people looked for content that meets their own preferences and interests, as opposed to the marketing desires and needs of networks and content creators.  

So – lovely visual design, horrid information design."
2019-03-07 16:59:08,ADD A BACKGROUND PLAY FEATURE ALREADY,1,Aeris AeriBerry,False,"We’ve been waiting and asking and voting for this LONG enough and would love to finally have this!! I’m confused why my iPhone shows the play button while my screens locked and the feature doesn’t even work on your app as it does on Netflix!! Want to be able to play my shows in the background while doing work! You’ve been stalling for WAY too long and many might subscribe again if you add this. Netflix is going to beat you soon enough and they already technically have since they beat you to it on the background audio feature on that note! Get to it, please or I’ll be next on the unsubscribing list and switch back to Netflix as I get more rewards on there for subscribing anyways!"
2018-09-12 16:55:22,Screen Freezes but sound still plays,2,Martyg.singer,False,"When I am watching something if I tap on the screen to pause, it freezes on the resume Episodes screen. I can’t get out of it, but the movie or show continues to play in the background. I can’t see the show and all you hear is the sound. The only way to fix it is to shut down the app completely and reopen it. It is really annoying. It doesn’t do this every time but it is about 30% of the time. It only does it on my iPad and so I would think it’s an apple issue. Please fix this. I just did an update and thought this would fix the issue but apparently you guys weren’t aware of this problem yet."
2018-03-23 00:45:40,Latest update- not a fan,2,Duo French,False,I don’t normally don’t write reviews but I have gotten annoyed several times that I want to.  The new app that allows you to scroll back no matter where you are at on your screen is annoying.  So many times I have been watching and just want to see how much is left and it doesn’t respond right away then I tap again and all of of a sudden I am back to the beginning and I have to try to get back where I was and end up having to rewatch another commercial bc I don’t pay premium.  Also how it opens is annoying...I have to click into the my stuff screen to see my shows where it used to be pulled up right when I opened it.
2018-11-15 03:23:12,Ehh,3,It's lovable111,False,"I would like to start off to say I have had problems with this app for a while. Whenever I click out of my app to go on something else and then come back to it, the show goes all the way back to the first commercial or the commercial I didn’t even leave off on. I am so disappointed that we are paying for a service like this and still have to deal with multiple commercials. I can watch my own tv for tv shows if you guys are going to be adding commercials. It makes no sense. The commercials are also way to long. Would’ve given it 5 stars if it wasn’t for commercials.👎🏽"
2020-04-11 01:44:12,Fix Autoplay,2,Ashkan M,False,"Autoplay never seems to work. It just pauses on an image for the show. Sometimes it has to do with subtitles sometimes it depends if you start the episode from I watched or from the part that shows all the episodes. Why can’t this ever work?

Problems with remembering where you left off. It might start it over or continue depending which part of the app your in. OR it doesn’t refresh and starts from the first episode you start with if Autoplay is actually working. And if it’s close to the end (more than one min) it’ll go to the next episode even if it’s like two or three mins remaining. This happens in some interfaces and sometimes not."
2018-12-10 23:00:50,The app is terrible,1,Mistydmorrid513,False,I don’t know what is wrong with this app. It was working fine until a month ago and now I have problems every single day I use it. It tells me that I cannot fast forward or rewind on commercials but the show I am watching is not on a commercial break. It tells me shows don’t exist and then the next morning they magically appear. It will change to a completely different show that’s not even on my list in the middle of watching one that is on my list. I am becoming so frustrated with it than I am about to cancel it completely. There are just too many problems and since it was updated three days ago and the bugs still aren’t fixed I don’t see a point in continuing to use it.
2018-09-23 15:50:21,Commercials,3,Jdelcid9,False,"The interface of the app is fine to me. The biggest issue for me is commercials. I believe that if you’re going to compete with Netflix and other big steaming apps you should look into: a) Reducing the amount of commercials shown at a time and b) if you are going to have commercials, at least change them up more often. It gets so annoying to have to watch/hear the same commercials over and over and over again. Besides that, the app is great. It has great shows and i can get used to the interface. I hope you take my review under consideration and keep up the good work."
2017-10-03 00:27:10,Not at all user friendly,5,bxzntbfz,False,"It's very hard to find shows that I would watch, and no longer adds shows that you have been watching to your watch list, which is super annoying. Also, all you have to do is accidentally bump your phone and you've completely lost your place in the show and are stuck watching yet another annoying set of the same exact commercials multiple times when you have to search for your place.."
2017-12-06 22:37:41,Entirely Frustrating,1,Zofi54,False,"First off it's hard to navigate right from the start, all of these suggested shows take up the entire screen which makes browsing slow to a crawl. Once an episode is playing the controls are extremely touchey, just an accidental tap can send you forwards or backwards to the commercial breaks- which REPLAY even when already watched, that's probably the worst part of this update. It's almost as if it were designed to force you into watching the ads twice. ONE OF THE WORST UPDATES EVER. I've probably been forced to watch an extra hour of commercials since updating, I cannot believe I'm paying for this. - EDIT: currently writing this while ads are RE PLAYING THAT I LITERALLY JUST WAS FORCED TO WATCH DUE TO AN ACCIDENTALLY FAST FORDWARD DUE TO THE APPS TOUCHINESS FING FIX THIS"
2017-10-29 16:22:32,Fix the rewind!!!,2,Deyto,False,"This function is horrible because it is way to easy to accidentally rewind to the beginning or end. When you pause the screen and you touch another part of the screen it rewinds to that part of your movie or show. It get extremely frustrating! When you accidentally rewind to the beginning it makes you watch long, annoying adds and then once you fast forward to your original spot you have to watch another add. If you accidentally scroll to the end it goes to the next episode making you have to go back and watch three more adds to get to your original spot. This function is horrible! FiX THIS!!"
2020-07-08 01:53:47,Every day I need to reinstall this app,3,Furb12,False,Unlike every other app on my device I need to reinstall this one every day I plan to use it.  When I try to watch something it spends some time loading and the  says I have a weak connection; I’m unable to play anything.  My connection is fine and other streaming apps work with no issues.  Even without this nagging problem the user experience feels clunkier than the other streaming apps I mentioned.  Some of the programming is quite good so for now I’ll keep using it but at some point I’ll probably cancel my subscription unless this app is fixed.
2019-11-19 12:52:44,Worst App Ever,1,forevs21$,False,"I have never written an app review but this app is actually terrible. I watch more ads than the show. I mean an ad every 5 mins that lasts 90 seconds and if you accidentally rewind or exit you have to watch the WHOLE 90 seconds again. The design is also horrible, it doesn’t even save your correct place in the episode so that when you come back to watch it later you have to watch the ads again. This is actually the worst app I have ever seen. I mean seriously who developed this because I can do a better job and I’m still learning computer science. Tip: to continue profitting off of displaying ads consider rearranging how the ads are shown to the viewer to please both the advertiser and your customer."
2018-12-28 17:41:36,Great selection - horrible menu system,3,pmkLMT,False,"This app and steaming site does have a great selection of movies and tv. The original content is fantastic and well produced.
My problem is with the app format.  The menu system is hard to follow and just doesn’t make a whole lot of sense. When I open the movies section it’s just a list of movies. They do have break out grouping suggestions across the top but the groupings are not really helpful. I would rather see it set up by genre or recognizable classifications. Unless you know the specific title to search by, it’s hard to find anything. Make this more intuitive."
2018-10-18 05:05:54,Very frustrating,2,Camaegle,False,"I’ve noticed that after watching a couple episodes consecutively that if I tap on the screen the whole video disappears and only the audio is left and I’m stuck staring at a frozen episode list. 

Also that is doesn’t track how many episodes I have left accurately, I have 3 episodes left of a 37 episode series that has both English and Japanese options but yet it tells me I still have 74 episodes left. 

For series that I’ve already started and am a good bit into it won’t show me the next episode to watch on the front screen of the show’s details, it’ll show me the first episode of that series even though it’s fully watched."
2017-11-14 12:42:06,Ununably poor design,3,Parker (Sunshine Pumper),False,"This is an absolute mess. The previous update was supposed to make navigation easier, but it is awful. Trying to navigate out of a series when one episode is over is horrendous. 
I don't want to watch the newest episode in a series I'm only part way through. I want to watch the NEXT episode I haven't seen. Yet I have to back out (after watch yet another ad, on top of the one I had to watch just to get out of the last video).
Please start testing this stuff with real users, not app designers. You would see that while your last version was bad, this is a major step down."
2017-10-27 00:54:13,Issues,5,What Da?!,False,"I love this app but it has many many issues, when tapping on the screen in rewinds or fast forwards to that place automatically. The audio fades out and won’t return. I have to tap out of the episode and wait a couple of seconds then resume and only then will the audio come back on. It doesn’t always resume from where I left off, most of the time it goes back to the previous episode I had been watching not the one I was actually on."
2020-08-03 11:35:22,A lot of issues,3,riannafaith,False,"I would like to preface my review that firstly, I do like the selection of shows that are available! I like the color scheme as well. However, the issues have become more technical. I recently updated the app and I like the new layout as the other one was confusing and it was hard to find anything. The issue this time is that it crashes every time I try to scroll. For some reason, it just crashes every single time, so I can only touch the “Play” button on whatever show I want to continue watching. I hope these issues can get resolved soon!"
2020-04-15 00:50:33,Read the other comments guys,1,Phoenixboy29,False,"If you look at the other comments you will see the same thing over and over.  This app constantly has glitches.  The buffering takes forever and all my other movie apps have no problem like that, well except for Disney+ which is owned by the same.  This has been happening even before covid-19 so that isn’t an excuse.  They refuse to listen to their customers and I honestly think they don’t care.  I pay for the adless option.  Still buffering issues and not to mention if you exit the app to try and help it doesn’t save where you are so you must fast forward and the buffering starts over.  Choose wisely this and Disney+ are the only apps that do that!!"
2020-04-06 06:48:13,Why are you expiring these good anime?,4,animeboi300,False,"Like I said in the title why are you expiring good anime? I just started to watch One Piece and now it says it getting expired in over a week? Why is that? Also, there’s Dragon Ball GT, Dragon Ball, Toriko, (etc.) Is it because they’re old anime? Or is the watch time dropping? Honestly I have no idea wether it’s like those two examples, or it’s just some thing else. If you are going to delete it, maybe you could add it back. I don’t know how this works at all so I’ll just stay in my lane. But as I said earlier, if you’re going to delete it, then just add it back."
2018-03-14 06:56:59,"Navigation, IA, and live tv make no sense",2,justinsepulveda,False,"Live TV and browsing shows are two completely different mental models. You combined them and it’s terrible. If I’m in live TV mode I wanna easily see what’s on or will be on soon or will be on tonight and I want it by channel (because I don’t know what I’m looking for but I know the channels of interest). Showing me a list of only what’s on now doesn’t accomplish that. Maybe something’s on later that I want to catch. Can’t do that here! And i want to add live channels to “my stuff”, so I don’t even have to enter the guide if I know the channel I want to leave on for the next few hours.

I left DirecTV Now for this and I want to stay but you’re making it difficult."
2018-02-14 01:55:56,Awful,1,P0NYfish,False,"Top three issues with the mobile app: 1) difficulty in browsing through shows and options to find new series to try out. 2) Touch screen means if you do not hit pause or one of the forward/back buttons, the program may jump to wherever you touched. 3) Previously, you could skip forward and watch commercials, and then go back without the commercials. Even when it skips due to my touching the screen, I have to go back through commercials, which can go up to two minutes. Also, cannot go to a previous point in the program without having to watch/listen to commercials. 

Using our of desperation, and not at all because I think this app has any redeeming qualities."
2020-05-02 04:21:06,Really sleek but it has problems,3,Jluck12,False,"I like the way all the content is laid out. It looks amazing in terms of appearance but I’ve been having a lot of issues with just playing the movies and shows I like. Every time I reopen this app it gives an error message that it can’t play the next episode, it’s no longer connected to internet, or it flat out says it can’t play the episode period! I have to close and reopen constantly. It’ll auto play one episode before it gives me an error message! The app is so fluid and intuitive but playback suuuucks! Please fix and I’ll give 5 stars like it deserves!"
2019-04-22 15:55:07,"Good shows, bad set up",3,tvvvvvvvvvaholic,False,"The way it’s organized doesn’t make sense. Difficult to navigate (for a millennial and someone who grew up on technology even) and will constantly stop bringing up shows on my list that I am watching weekly still and still have new episodes coming up weekly?
Too much priority goes to the next episode. It’s a pain to go to the full catalog of a show and try to find a specific episode which it seems like I do often. It’s like the app doesn’t want you to go out of order.
The content is quality and improving still! Set up is awful and frustrating."
2017-11-28 19:44:38,PLEASE fix this,1,sathores,False,"I'm reviewing this just to point out something in the hopes it will be fixed: when watching a show, if you click anywhere on the screen other than the rewind/forward/pause buttons, it thinks you are skipping ahead/backward to that spot in the runtime, which is incredibly annoying because then it jumps there and you have to find the original spot you were at again. It's especially annoying in my case, because I don't have premium, so if I inadvertently skip forward I'm forced to sit there and watch an extra series of ads, unable to go back until they end. Even after over months of using this app I still do this on accident. Please fix it!!! It’s seriously awful."
2019-08-25 03:05:00,Great App,4,Roo$terRoo$ter,False,"This app has become 1 of 3 of my go-to streaming apps. Content is diverse and stretches well into each of my favorite genres. The ads in the basic version are spaced out in a manner that is more than bearable. Plus, they don’t take up much time. That being said, PLEASE rotate the ads a bit for us that go show-binging. 4 weddings and a funeral looked appealing the first 5-10x the ad aired today. After about 30x, I feel like I’ll do whatever it takes NOT to watch the show. Ok, enough cynicism. Thanks for keeping this app up to date and worth the money. Kudos."
2017-09-20 14:45:08,Terrible interface and my stuff disappeared,1,prolixian,False,"All of the shows I followed have disappeared and I have to rebuild ""my stuff"" from scratch. None of the shows suggested ""for me"" have any relevance to my viewing history or interest, so this page feels like sponsored content, not something ""for me"".
Worst of all, seeing a single show per screen, rather than a matrix of images to choose from, is just a waste of time and space. Even the screens that show multiple items in a category have huge images and show only a few per screen. I want to be able to browse a large amount of info at a glance, without needing to search or click through multiple screens.
I'd revert to the old app in a flash."
2020-04-28 12:33:38,Constantly crashing can’t even open app...,3,Art.Almonds,False,"I love this app however at this moment I don’t. I used it all the time, until today when it started crashing! I’ve done everything to try and fix it but nothing is working. I’ve uninstalled it, powered down my phone, deleted other apps, updated my phone. Nothing has fixed it. I shouldn’t be having this problem since I have a iPhone 8 which is less then a year old. Really disappointed since being able to watch shows over my phone is really convenient for me. Hope to here back from anyone for help."
2017-10-02 03:34:17,Bad update,5,BrookieCookie6,False,"I lost a lot of the things I had saved to watch later. It's so much more difficult to look through movies. I used to be able to see the entire movie catalog at once. I also miss my auto play feature. Now it stops playing a series after only 2-3 episodes.  I do like the new look that came with the update, but I lost a lot of functionality. In addition, the app crashes no matter which device I may be watching on (iPhone, iPad, Roku, smart tv app...THEY ALL CRASH)!"
2019-07-09 03:37:29,More bugs,4,jdjdhdvejskdvd,False,"I just updated it and now when I make the screen whole the time, battery, and WiFi symbol all still appear. It is taking up screen space and covering a lot of what is happening. I would like for them to disappear again. Otherwise the only other issue is sometimes when I play the show from where I stopped it goes back. Plus when I hit the go forward for 30 seconds it goes back. I have no clue. Up until these little thugs this has been my favorite app. Solid other wise. Thanks"
2019-03-30 12:12:34,Why?!,1,111112&847,False,"I get that you think its cute that your app is barely workable and you constantly need to 'squash' bugs, but this isnt funny to me. On top of all the problems I've stated in earlier reviews; it not makes me restart my ipad anytime I dane to try to close the app. The app refuses to let me leave it or even allow me access to my homepage or any of the settings to close it down. I love the content, hate the app and have so since the major changes almost 2 years ago. Look a netflix. Copy and repeat. Stop all this other crap. Update. Your newest bug squashing has made it so two programs will play at once. Making watching anything on my iPad impossible. Thanks for the great work. You guys should be used to sarcasm."
2018-12-05 16:19:38,Confused but still love the app,4,Donkey Byrd,False,"Love the app, love that I can keep up with current programming, enjoy the ease of use. I’ve read some reviews to see if anyone was experiencing what has been going on with mine and saw so many other issues other than mine. The app seems to disconnect and I have to go back in to pair it with my chromecast after 3-4 or so shows running.  I also have to constantly hit “remove” from suggested shows because they never actually go away. Still love the app just throwing out the things I’ve run into lately."
2018-10-26 22:06:56,Love it,4,alyssa bloomquist,False,"We have the no commercial plan, I love everything, but a recent update, caused all the shows that I have on my watch list to constantly start back on episode 1. Even if I’ve watched the entire series it shows “start watching season 1, episode 1” I miss when it would show “all caught up” so I can easily see when a new episode has aired. Also, I was re-watching a show, and when I went to pick up where I left off, it was back at the very first episode. Can we please change that back to the way it was before."
2020-09-24 23:01:42,Constantly Have to Force Quit to Continue to the Next Episode,5,Poboomot,False,"I rarely review apps but this one has gotten so bad recently that I had to. I use the iPad app to watch tv shows and lately at the end of every single episode, no exaggeration, I get an error message. When I try to go to the main page and reload the episodes, it just gives me the loading circle until I force quit. Once I force quit and reopen the app, it works fine until that episode ends."
2020-10-09 11:22:19,Needs some TLC,3,Gmanvbva,False,"We have LiveTV also and it needs some love.

I nearly every device we have (iPads, iPhones, FireTVs, Echo Shows) we will start a show and after 3-5 minutes it buffers and jumps back multiple minutes. For example I use my iPad or Echo Show to watch the news or sports center every morning and without fail every day it does this.

The interface/guide is slow and buggy. It also doesn’t update the Home Screen or guide when relaunching the app. So every morning I have to force close the app (swipe it away) and launch it fresh so the Home Screen and interface will update."
2017-10-15 21:18:20,Is it just me?,5,Hate it•,False,I'm certain it isn't my internet connection because all my devices work with all my other apps but since the update I can't watch a show all the way through without interruption because it won't load constantly have to go back wait 2 mins then try again... it's very annoying! And also why can't I use it with only my cellular LTE??? It's annoyingly that I pay for a streaming service I have to connect to wifi for everytime I use it 😒
2020-06-25 07:29:05,Seeking,4,jejdknsidbd,False,"I was trying to watch where I left off on the episode I was watching and it completely lost my place so I tried using the press and hold to seek so I can try to get back at the place I was at. All It did was give me 25 seconds worth of adds and leave me at the beginning. Tried it again and again but all it gave me was adds, not even the place I was trying to get to. Over all that, they have a variety of shows which is really good and I enjoy that a lot but this just the thing that bugs me a lot."
2020-05-05 06:04:29,Stopped working,4,Sammy santos,False,The app is great but after a while it started to not work at all. Like every time I tried to work the app it would say connection failed try to refresh the page but every time I rest the page it didn't work and I know it's not my WiFi because Netflix was working perfectly fine and so we're my other apps that need WiFi. I even rest my phone and yet it still hasn't worked. No matter how many times I tried it just wouldn't work. Please fix this matter as soon as possible.
2019-03-15 09:27:20,"Good, but I wish...",4,lmichaela94,False,"...that the queue wasn’t so annoying. 
The option to turn the auto play off is there, I know. But during TV season, when I have multiple episodes of different shows lined up, I wish it would play from what’s up in my Keep Watching or, better yet, that I could control what’s queued up in the auto play and maybe THEN it goes into automatically selected stuff after my chosen episodes have run through.
Good app, though. Lets me watch TV for fairly decent price, especially when compared to cable."
2019-03-14 07:59:51,Password recovery,4,G📅,False,This is a great app for commuters. I usually leave my account logged in. When I switched phones and had to log back in I couldn’t remember my password. I used the recovery option on the app (which was supposed to email me a recovery link) but was never sent a link to the email associated to my account. I checked my junk mail folder as well but there was  nothing. The app didn’t give me a number to call for support either. I finally remembered my password and was able to log back in a day later.
2019-03-02 15:58:35,NBC Channel’s,3,Roman9779,False,Very disappointed with the nbc channel’s. I could not get the Sunday night football game even though I had local channel coverage all day and every other time and just this week the nbcsports channel cut out in the middle of the Chelsea premier game and said the channel was not a part of my subscription. Yet today the channel is available and I am able to watch. Very frustrating. I would like to see the hockey games like you had last year as well. That was a huge reason for going with you. I loved that I could watch the Vegas Golden Knights when I was not able to make it to the game.
2017-10-10 13:42:46,App Update Is The Pits,1,LTrutna,False,"I have never left a review of an app before, but the new mobile UX is just terrible. It's restrictive, difficult to navigate, and forced me to choose show preferences that didn't include anything I would actually watch. I'm fairly certain it was designed just to put certain programming in front of me, not to help with actual discovery. Now, it's nearly impossible to tell when there's a new episode of a show I follow, and nothing is in an intuitive place. Most options offered to me in each category seem to be very old shows, or some terrible CBS ish. (The day this app puts Big Bang Theory in front of me will be the last straw.)

While the interface is prettier, I would take the old one back any day."
2019-12-09 07:43:05,Not working,3,Michaela.colleen,False,"This latest update isn’t working. Just clicked on the latest show I’ve been watching and an error pops up saying “this isn’t included in your subscription” so I tried other tv shows and movies, every time it says I can’t watch shows that are included in my subscription. Also the amount of ads are ridiculous. Sometimes I will only get to watch 2 minutes of a show before another 90 second ad appears. Apparently for a paid service you’re required to watch the same amount of ads as you do the actual show."
2018-12-09 23:17:31,Review.,4,David shirley,False,"Great price, lots of channels much better than roku for the money. Easy to use. Has quite a few connectio issues with my Chromecast where it just buffers randomly. Also, if you go out of the app an come back in you have to reconnect the app to the tv which is annoying. The volume connection is finicky as well. Sometimes you have to recast the screen to the tv to regain control over the volume even if you dont disconnect from the app. Overall highly recommended even though there are quirks. MUCH better than cable."
2020-04-18 22:50:46,Not enough episodes!!,3,food13747573628374763758383757,False,"I'm just going to flat out say it: THERE AREN'T ENOUGH DUBBED EPISODES FOR NARUTO SHIPPUDEN!!!! The only real reason I downloaded this app was so that I could watch Naruto Shippuden. But with only 140 out of somewhere around 500 episodes that are dubbed, I was just getting to the good part and now there is only Japanese audio with English subtitles! It's hard for me to look at the subtitles at the same time I'm looking at the anime itself. So either tell me they're still dubbing the episodes, or add the rest of the dubbed ones! I'm not trying to be harsh with this review, but now I'm paying an extra $5.99 a month for no reason!"
2020-07-14 21:07:08,Crashes Every Time I play an Episode,1,MightyMaddie9,False,"I love a lot of the shows on this app, and will often put them on in the background while I work around the house, but recently I can’t load a single episode up without the entire app crashing. I am sick on having to sit through 40 seconds of adds just for the entire app to crash and have to watch them again and again hoping that it will load and finally allow me to watch the episode. I’ve checked my WiFi and my phone multiple times, but neither of those is the problem. At this point I’m considering deleting the app as it is now just a glorified add app. I wouldn’t download this app until this problem is fixed."
2020-07-08 05:21:18,This app never works,1,Srivatsava,False,"I have never been this frustrated with any streaming app. Everytime it gives “Hmm something up logout and try” I logout and it never logins me in again. Weird error saying please check internet, yes dude I have internet all my 200 apps working except this trash. Same thing happens on iPad and Apple TV. Even on google people said delete the app and reinstall it. That works sometimes. Why should I have to go through all this trouble to watch a show on this app. If the developers are reading this , you guys need better skill set because your app doesn’t work. Nobody cares about the color coding and effects it needs to serve the prime purpose. Hope they learn and fix this with next update."
2020-05-06 01:32:01,Just nooooooOooooooo,1,bossgirl103,False,I like the shows and all ... but like almost everything is getting expired and deleted I had to download so many app just to watch one show I can’t even watch Steven Universe or any of the Harry Potter movies cause they say “currently unavailable” then it just deletes itself ugh just do not download this if you never move on from your favorite show or you move on faster I really don’t even have anything good to say about this DO NOT DOWNLOAD ugh and it doesn’t name the titles right it’s so confusing I could go on and on about this app but I can’t cause its so annoying and if it doesn’t get its act together I will delete it and come back and give and even worse review get it together or else ...
2018-02-25 18:17:16,Worst Update Ever!!!!,5,Tahi3412,False,Whenever I try to pause the screen and hit it twice by accident the show/movie I’m watching jumps all over the place taking from the middle to the end or the other way around. On top of that there are commercials which are prompted whenever this happens which has me waiting around to go back to where I previously was. Change it to a regular scrolling bar!!!!! It works for every other app if it ain’t broke don’t try to fix it!!!!!
2019-10-06 15:16:00,Great but annoying,3,Ttdyyu,False,"I love this app and all my favorite shows are on it but I’ve been having this problem for months and I think they’ll fix it with the next update but so far nothing... if I stop watching an episode in the middle of it, when I go back to watch it it doesn’t remember where I left off, it makes me start all over. It’s extremely annoying, especially when I get stuck watching ads and I’m not even at the right part of where I left off. I end up spending 2 minutes trying to figure out where I left off. It’s really annoying."
2019-06-15 17:12:00,I like it but there are issues,3,Wackado-be,False,"I have a really annoying issue besides the fact that after a few episodes of tv shows it does say there’s a connection issue on my side. Which is not true. And I see there are others with the same issue. 
But my biggest issue is that I keep getting subtitles on every movie and tv show I watch. Even though I Tuen subtitles off the still come up and I have to keep shutting them off. This is super annoying! When are you going to fix these issues?
On the bright side I do like the selection of movies and shows you have."
2019-05-06 09:17:51,Great but could use some improvement,4,Jav_xx,False,"The list of shows in “my stuff” can become too long and it’s rather annoying to continue scrolling and scrolling to find a show. A viewing of multiple shows in rows and columns could lessen this burden. Also more urban shows and 90s - 00s shows being added would be greatly appreciated. Shows such as the fresh prince, Martin, my wife and kids, and 00s Disney and Nick kids content would be nice to have. Also more pop culture and classic films being added would be great too."
2018-05-05 22:03:22,Thank you,3,LGnotSM,False,"I was so thrilled to discover the update to the app and you have absolutely washed away 90% of my pain points.

That being said....

I wish picture in picture was more reliable. When I navigate away from your app while watching content the video does properly go to picture in picture mode but the playback pauses for some reason and tapping on the video box doesn’t bring up the buttons for resuming playback. I have to swipe up to display the control panel to resume playback. I really wish the video would continue to play if and when I navigate away from your app.

If I’m watching a TV series in picture in picture mode the app seems to close at the end of an episode. I wish instead it started the next show. 

Would also love to see improvements to your content catalog user interface down the road as well. 

All in all I’m seeing lots of progress with the most recent update and that make me happy!"
2018-04-08 14:57:47,Impossible to watch live TV,3,booklvr555,False,"The screen is constantly freezing and the audio often doubles, so that you hear two different audios at one time. If things don’t change, I’ll have to use another provider.  UPDATE, I changed the video quality from auto to medium and now it’s working. My only other complaint is to improve switching between favorite networks easily, I don’t want to have to scroll through every network. Also, a quicker way to clean up recorded shows, like add a select function and then a delete, so you can quickly delete unwanted shows."
2018-04-03 23:21:12,Needs work,3,💅🏼💄💋💍,False,"I wish they would make it so you can mark episodes as “watched” to remove the notice. If I watch something else where it would be nice to not have so many unwatched on my list confusing me if I seen it or not. I like to just check my list for new episodes (so I don’t get a ton of notifications) and see if there’s any new episodes for me to watch 

Also the new update it really annoying because if i tap the screen to check the time or how far I’m in the show, etc it will fast forward or rewind to where I tapped on the show which has caused so many spoilers ☹️"
2018-01-19 10:12:10,Too many problems,1,Thtkid_jose,False,"First off the new layout is pretty bad and annoying to use, the FF and RW buttons are pretty bad too and if you accidentally tap the screen while watching something, it’ll instantly take you to that spot and you’ll lose your last spot. But I didn’t mind that sooo much until the subtitles recently got screwed up. I can’t watch any non English shows because there are no more subtitles. I go to the setting to try and fix them however they’re greyed out and my only option is “accessibility settings” which takes me to my iPhone settings. When I go to media and turn subtitles on, THEY STILL DONT WORK. Please fix this annoying bug and really do some work on the new design of the app."
2017-10-17 10:26:23,Difficult,1,Sousy sous,False,"Maybe myself and all the other reviewers - since the update, are missing something, but this just seems so unnecessarily hard to use. I am not one afraid of change, in fact I am embrace it.
From all the same problems listed in other reviews. Which I agree with. I feel slightly held hostage by this thing now, is their a tutorial that perhaps will help us all better understand what is great about this? Is the picture in picture hidden? Is their a way to see how ""my shows"" functions more like my previous watch list? So much to scroll through? So many pages? So complicated. I appreciate that a lot of thought and care went into this major overhaul. Maybe I am being dense."
2020-09-17 16:02:55,Constant interruptions,2,doc squatch,False,"While watching anything using this application ive run into constant issues regarding streaming programs. I could be at home wired into the network or at work in a concrete building, my programs are constantly being interrupted by a loading screen and the ever frustrating, “sorry were having issues playing that.” After closing and reopening the app the issue would stop, but only momentarily before it would resurge and ruin another show. Considering this is a streaming service i assumed that you would be able to do exactly that. Until these issues are corrected i highly recommend sling"
2020-03-02 03:42:42,My stuff has gotten worse,4,Portsmouth Brett,False,"The “My Stuff” section organization has gotten worse in the latest updates. It marks many episodes watched as unwatched, it shows many minutes of unfinished episodes when most (99%) of the shows watched have been watched to the end of the closing credits, finally, there should be a way to mark shows as caught up. It’s a very sloppy interface. Shows should also have some sort of notification or icon for series where commercials can NOT be skipped."
2020-01-23 23:37:11,Not great,2,cweave624,False,"This app is the worst out of all the streaming apps. It’s constantly disconnecting from my chrome cast (I don’t have any problems with other streaming apps) and it never loads properly. Also you can’t watch anything on your phone while streaming with this app on your tv or every video is on top notch full volume. Scares me every time. The volume is always messed up. It’s also hard to navigate in general and the autoplay never puts on the shows in my watch list. There are more issues than not. I never have to worry about Netflix. I wish they would fix these issues, then I would use this app more often."
2019-01-07 02:26:11,...,3,Ms. Beamer,False,"So... I’d recommend this to friends, but only after they’ve tried everything else. This is the first time I’ve seen a paid application have ads and I hate it. The only reason I’m using it is because I can’t switch my card on Netflix. I recommend you remove the ads because it’s getting you no where, especially when we’re paying you 8 dollars a month for this buggy service. What I’m saying is this is the last app I’d recommend. The reason I’m giving 3 stars is because it has a much higher selection than any other app I’ve tried which is good."

2017-10-24 05:09:55,Lot of room for improvement.,3,SkHebert,False,"The app is functional, and I don’t experience any flaws that prevent me from wanting to use the app. But there are a lot of little things about it that bug me. For instance:

1: Why, when I’m in the middle of a series and click on More Episodes on that series’ information page, does it not take me to the episode I’m currently on? This would be helpful, considering the fact that:

2: Often times, the same episode will repeat itself over and over. Even when I click the next episode I have issues when the previous one playing again. Very annoying. 

3: There have been many times where I will accidentally click the screen and it’ll somehow take me back to the beginning of the episode. This is an issue because first off, I have to find where I was again. And more importantly, I’m subjected to another ad that I shouldn’t be. Not sure what the solution for this would be."
2020-08-24 10:18:05,Terrible service/Quality,1,FCKY187,False,"Whenever I try to stream shows/movies it always tells me that the episodes/movies are unavailable but if I change devices it works for about ten minutes, until your ads audio runs over whatever I’m streaming. Recently the app audio rewinds every ten seconds while the video/pictures continue. Terrible service and no matter what I do to try to fix it, just seems to be a problem on the app. Used to love this app but just hasn’t been the same for awhile. Hope you can fix these technical difficulties soon since there was no where else to report such problems. Also many other bug/glitches I am not pleased with."
2020-02-21 22:20:44,Too many commercials or ads.,2,Mgvivi83,False,"Whatever you call them, there are too many of them. It’s bad enough that they have taken over television, but now the streaming apps also? They want over 60 dollars a month for ad-filled tv and and streaming. You cannot rewind without having to watch the ads all over again. And then, they play maybe 5 minutes of the show and they start all over again. It’s a shame that something that is suppose be enjoyable is turning irritating and definitely not worth the money. 

On a another note, the customer service was great, but the service is disappointing."
2019-05-21 12:00:43,"Over all the apps great, but...",4,LeaLizzy,False,"Over all the app is great for iPhone XS Max and iPad mini 2. With most of the updates there have been little bugs, but I was able to get through those. With the last update for both the iPhone and iPad (version 5.48.1) isn’t good. I’ve even tried uninstalling and reinstalling with no success. Most shows will play. However, the show I was watching when I did the updated will not play. Would like to see this updated so I can get back to my show. It was just getting good!!!"
2018-12-04 19:54:04,Not Happy At All.,1,Kiley333,False,"1st the fact that they only have current seasons not previous seasons of certain shows is absolutely garbage. 2nd the fact that I’ve got to sit through 6 commercials in a 40 minute episode is garbage. 3rd the fact that all 6 commercials are 107 seconds long each, which would be okay if they actually played, not having to load every literal 2 seconds it plays. 4th it also only plays 5 seconds of the show then pauses to load no matter the quality or WiFi bars. It honestly makes no sense that someone in the same house as me using the same internet & same account has absolutely no problem. I am very very VERY disappointed in this GARBAGE. 👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻"
2018-11-28 03:51:20,Poor update,2,lildolphindoll,False,"I was so excited about the new live TV I watched with a co worked to make sure I’d love it and I did. Now every time I try to watch on my iPad or iPhone (both up to date on updates and the app is as well) it doesn’t allow me to watch anything. It says it’s going to bring me to another page to set up live. Instead it just brings me back to the screen you get when you open the app. I restart my device and delete the app multiple times and it still doesn’t work. It does this glitch very frequently, more times than I am able to watch. Very irritating and makes me want to take my business elsewhere."
2018-11-30 03:23:37,Problem with a show,5,Anacil,False,"I’ve been trying to watch one of your shows on my Apple TV and at the beginning I thought it was probably my internet connection, but it turns out that I’d only had problems with that show...”Find me in Paris” is like it has a problem, I’ve try with episode 1 and 2, the shows starts perfect then the screen goes black and you can only see the CC going, buy nothing. It’s a shame, I really want to see that show."
2019-01-14 03:10:56,Please Fix in Next Update,3,derryqueen44,False,"This app is pretty easy and straight forward to use but every time I go to actually watch a tv show I get the message “Welcome to live tv, Complete the the setup on the next screen to begin watching live tv on your phone.” Mind you I’m not trying to watch a “Live” tv show. I’m trying to watch an older episode and I’m trying to watch it on my iPad not my iPhone. I would very much like if this issue is fixed because I do like this app when I use it on my iPhone but I’d like to also be able to use it on my iPad without weird glitches like this one."
2017-11-16 13:03:05,Please bring back the previous version and PIP!,5,CuriousStrength,False,"This GUI is cumbersome and not helpful. I am being exposed to a fraction of your offerings now. Very difficult to find new shows to watch. Also picture in picture keeps coming and going! Please restore this functionality...and KEEP it restored! Best of all, bring back the former app!

Also, I agree with other reviewers about the rewind functionality. I have lost my place multiple times due to this asinine full screen setup."
2020-01-09 01:24:49,BEST APP,5,ernienic,False,This is by far the most used app on my phone. I like lots of different shows and this has everything I search for. In my opinion it  is well worth the money you pay! It is quick to load and has a convenient resume episode or movie option along with the “my stuff tab” I use it to save other shows that I am watching and want to watch in the and future and ITS SO HELPFUL. I’m so grateful for this app and will use this for a long time
2017-10-20 21:21:38,Opaque frosted ridiculous interface,1,Hesekiah,False,"The faded out opaque colors of the shows, only becoming clear when you click on it, has to be the most ridiculous dysfunctional feature I’ve ever seen. I can’t see what I’m looking at! My eyes strain and I feel like I have to look through the frosted nonsense design before I can figure out what the show is! Content is great, design and functionality is a complete disaster. Getting an error now on top of it and can’t play anything. Is your design team filled with interns who have no sense and experience? Sure does play that way. You guys are missing the mark by such a distance that you should seriously be embarrassed and ashamed. Seriously unbelievable."
2017-09-25 01:41:25,I would give it less than one star if I could,1,ThundartheColberian,False,This is a waste of time.  I spend more time hunting for new episodes of shows I watch and my favorites are relegated to some hidden menu. I had to finally go online to import them over from the other app.  Not to mention the fact there is no way to delete all the profiles I have made that I have long forgotten but now have to sort through every time I turn on.  It tells me to go to the website and there is no profiles category in the accounts page. This isn't user friendly.  I end up scrolling through menus and shows it recommends based on some random guess about me.  (A bad guess at that.)  This app is one craptacular mess.
2020-04-01 04:10:09,Not happy!!!,1,Very Angu,False,"I was in the middle of a movie, got up to use the restroom and when I came back the movie was “currently unavailable” and wouldn’t let me watch it anymore. I have had several problems with it not letting me watch a movie and it telling me to choose a different movie because there was some error. I’ll turn my phone off and come back and the movie will have restarted from the beginning which also happens when I try to go back 10 seconds. Um excuse me I wanted to rewatch that last 10 seconds, I did not want to watch the whole movie from the beginning again! Honestly I am really not happy with this streaming service at all and do not recommend it."
2018-05-23 01:57:26,Not visually impaired friendly,5,Merli126,False,It doesn’t have audio description for people like myself who is visually impaired and totally blind and VoiceOver doesn’t read summary or it wouldn’t on the beach or legs or my options it would be nice if you guys could add in voiceover completely on the app and it would be nice if you guys could add in audio description that way we can see and enjoy like everybody else this app that would make a world of difference for people like myself who are visually impaired
2019-06-27 02:21:50,Worst app ever!!,1,Jillean k,False,"This is literally the worst app I’ve ever used! Every single time I try and watch a sho, I have an issue. Either I get an error that pops up telling me to restart my phone and/or, if it actually does decide to play, it almost never starts where I left off, it starts from the beginning and I have to spend more time finding wherever I left off. It’s so frustrating. I wish I could just open the app, tap on my show, press play and have it play....And play where I left off.. You know, like how it should be for a subscription that you overpay for every month 😡!! Probably going to cancel after I’m finished with the show that I’m watching, not worth the money and hassle."
2019-06-12 20:42:50,Good program but adds.,4,Chase Listorti,False,"This app to me is good enough to edge out Netflix, but they kill you with adds. You either have to pay 13 dollars a month for no adds or you can pay 7 dollars a month and get flooded with adds. For example I like watching survivor, which are all 40-50 minutes and the reunion episodes which are like 1 and a half hours. They will have 4 or 5 minute and a half adds for the regular one and 15 for the reunions. It wouldn’t be so bad if they didnt play the same 2 adds every time -_-"
2019-06-11 04:24:24,Blocked app access on iPhone,1,DeeGee216,False,When opening the app it says access is blocked and provides a link for more information. The link takes me to the general help site not a specific page regarding my issue. Additionally the blocked access message tells me to log in from my home network while one of my home devices is on/ connected. I have done all of that and still the app won’t open on my phone. What’s worse is there is zero information on the supposed HELP/SUPPORT page regarding this. In other words...there is NO additional information only what shows on screen in the app and when doing what it suggests does not work there is no where to get it resolved.
2018-09-08 19:46:38,A year later,1,overlypicky,False,"While the reliability has gotten better I still do not like the overall look and usability. It’s still a pain looking for shows. Lineup needs to go away. The full screen images are not necessary, I’d rather have thumbnails as the default. They need to have a skip intro option. And please let the genres be editable, I don’t want suggestions or kids shows or true crime, home and cooking etc. make my experience better by letting me remove that stuff. If it wasn’t for my wife I wouldn’t be a customer. Thankfully I have the old version / classic version on my iPad and I will never update it. It really is better than what you have now. How about making it an option."
2017-12-23 14:09:20,Doesn't work anymore,5,MastaChef(:,False,"The app worked fine on my iPad a few weeks ago, but now, it won't even go to the login screen. It shows the loading animation then says ""Something Is Wrong"" with the only option to ""Try Again"". I have rebooted my iPad, reinstalled, checked for app updates, etc. Nothing has worked. I'm running an older version because my iPad is iOS 9 (because that's the last system my iPad supports. Please fix."
2018-05-01 04:15:40,Please stop logging me out,1,CoolKaat,False,"I keep getting logged out of my account. I’ll have watched something and then leave, come back after only a couple hours and I’ll be logged out! Why? It’s getting more persistent and it’s annoying. What if I stop remembering my password? What’s the point of logging me out? I watch something almost every day and it almost always logs me out.

Also, after I’m done watching an episode and I try to click the arrow to leave, nothing happens. I have to play the next episode in order for me to exit out. I have a brand new phone so nothing’s wrong with the screen. My free trial is coming to an end, maybe that’s why, but all this is making me not want to subscribe."
2018-04-27 12:34:22,Auto-Play,3,Syn5485048362,False,Instead of auto playing content that I have saved in ‘My stuff’ then app always tries to play bunheads. I just want to be able to watch the all the episodes that came out the day before seamlessly w having to go back and forth. If there was a way to queue up content before or remove shows from the auto play list I would definitely rate the add better. If there was a way to thumbs down content I don’t like so that I never have to see it on my played list or have the next episode be in the auto play options that’d be amazing.
2018-02-22 22:37:06,I'd give it five stars if it wasn't for one feature,2,WooDeathTrap,False,"The scrolling is absolutely horrendous in this app. There's nothing worse than trying to see how much longer I have in my episode and end up starting the entire episode over because the scrolling isn't limited to a single section of the screen. Why isn't there a scroll bar?! The entirety of my screen shouldn't have the ability to scroll through the show, there should be a single section (like literally everything else) so I don't have to spend the next five minutes searching for my spot, it's infuriating. Nothing ruins a good episode quite like it."
2018-02-11 03:29:35,"Buffer,buffer,buffer,",1,456421,False,"Please go back to older version, it worked awesome, this new fancy one is not good.  Shows buffer constantly even when set on the lowest download amount. Ever heard of the expression ""if it's not broke don't fix it""?
Update... still horrible.  Works okay on Roku but on the iPad it takes forever to load a show and sometimes just stops and buffers and buffers and buffers.  I resubscribed to Netflix so I can watch stuff on my iPad and phone.
Update, now when I try to watch a show on my iPhone or iPad, it buffers for 5-10 minutes before the show plays.  Then the show will run for 2 minutes and buffer again for 5 minutes.  It takes over 2 hours to watch a 42 minute episode."
2017-12-03 19:05:47,Sound but no picture,5,mamamadsen,False,Terrible. Never loads properly always buffering and when I connect my iPhone to my tv to watch on bigger screen it never shows up on my tv the volume plays from the television set but the picture does not it only plays on my cell phone. Please fix. I would love to be able to watch my shows from my phone on my tv but there’s always an issue. Quite discouraging. Netflix never has that issue.
2020-08-19 08:14:30,They fixed it!,5,pauloosha,False,"“Super annoying rewind and forward controls. I got restarted 5 times on the same episode and each restart( when I was just trying to get back to where I left off) I had to watch another 30 seconds of the SAME DANG charmin commercial. The “this program doesn’t support forward or rewind” crap needs to stop. How hard is it to get YouTube’s functionality?” - My review before, but now they’ve fixed the issue 👍🏻"
2020-06-17 05:53:42,ads,4,um yee yee,False,I love everything about this just 2 things the first one is that not every show is on here which is not a big problem but there was this one show that I was so excited to watch and then I find out it’s not on there and the second thing was the ads this is my only real problem I feel like there’s an ad every 5 minutes and then it comes on and it’s like 3 minutes long with 5 ads but I guess that just really bothers me anyways everything is else is great
2018-09-29 11:51:51,Worse since the update,5,Fishchick1,False,"Ever since the recent update I’ve run into numerous problems. Shows won’t play, giving me an error saying it isn’t in the proper format moments after I was just watching them. The browse function isn’t working at all for shows, movies or networks. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling but to no avail. Very disappointing as this is one of my favorite apps for entertainment. I might have to cancel my subscription soon."

But lately—the past few days—the app refusing to play anything on my phone for more than a few seconds. I’ll have good signal, or my data will be on, and it just will not work. On my PlayStation it’s fine but I have no idea what’s going on with my phone. I’m going to update the phone and cut it off and on—though I doubt it’s a problem with my ACTUAL phone but I’ll give it the benefit of the doubt. Please get this fixed. I’ll fix the star rating if it is!"
2019-05-02 12:22:34,Wow!,4,Scorpiōn,False,"This is a great app, I love almost all of the shows and I am very happy about the recent addition of Full House 🏡 the original, better than Fuller House. I love this app and the reason why I didn’t give 5 stars is for the reason that it doesn’t seem to have an offline mode for iPad or a way to download movies and tv show episodes. Like on my iPad I would appreciate it if I could watch shark while in the car... Yes I said Shrek 😂. Thanks to the developers for making a good app! Please consider the offline mode if you devs are reading this."
2018-12-07 16:20:47,Review and Question,4,Jtoltec,False,"The app is great , I’d refer it 9/10 to any of my friends , but I just wanted to ask since I’m kinda into anime, but there are some shows ( stack on titan, Naruto shippuden, etc) I like watching the shows and all , but in naruto shippuden, season 3 is where the dubs end , I just wanted to know if y’all were going to update it to where I might be able to hear the dubbed version, cause it’s kinda hard to read the words , and then 5 seconds later a fight begins , so I just want to know if y’all are gonna put more dubs in there"
2018-11-21 05:49:05,Updated shows,1,Missy21175,False,"Am I the only one having an issue with new episodes not updating in “My stuff”? I have to go into the show, go into episodes, and then scroll down to to watch the latest episode Before the update that wasn’t happening, it would automatically be in the My Stuff section. Please fix. I PAY WAAAAAAY TO MUCH MONEY FOR SOMETHING TO NOT WORK PROPERLY.

Update: So new Thanksgiving update has still not fixed previous issues. What’s worse is that if I close the app midway through a show (by accident) the show starts from the beginning. I think you should just leave well enough alone and go back to your original UI and software. Things were so much better back when..."
2018-03-28 05:03:39,5.19,5,Zanderdander,False,"The new update has made it basically unusable. Logged out constantly, shows never load, click on them and nothing happens, shows quit playing, constant buffering... I could go on and on but I’ve wasted enough time waiting an hour and a half for one 30 min episode of bob’s burgers. Tried multiple networks so that’s not the issue. Maybe I’ll finish this episode by next year but I’m not getting my hopes up."
2020-08-21 22:12:13,Overall good,4,D365K,False,"Please stop changing the app format. It is irritating having to figure out where you’ve moved things and having to rewire the reflex associated with where to tap and for what. It’s not enhancing user experience just because you want a fresh new look.

Keep doing what you’re doing quality and content wise. There’s an excellent assortment of shows and movies, that have kept me basically nonstop entertained since subscribing. Aside from occasional glitches, the video quality is also great."
2020-02-17 14:25:31,Can’t play in the background,2,Aiharrisal,False,"I gave this 2 stars because it’s very annoying for me to not be able to play the app in the background and just listen to shows while I walk, or text. It ends up draining my battery even fast when I constantly have it open... I got the subscription so I can watch South Park and other shows I’ve seen, not to be glued to my phones screen all the time. 

Please fix this... I don’t know it matters to the developers how their customers watch to the shows... all you should care about is we have a subscription and are using your app. I mean... Netflix gets it! (Just saying...)"
2019-10-27 19:40:37,Predatory Ad Policy,1,lsatterfield,False,"It didn’t used to be this way, but now every time I decide to rewind back before a commercial break, the app will play the commercials again. There’s no way to skip them. It’s ridiculous to force users to watch ads that long and then punish paying customers to watch them over. It’s predatory.
The rewind and fast forward functions within the app can be done accidentally with too much ease, so if you fast forward when you don’t intend to, you are forced to watch ads before you can even skip back to the spot you are at. And then guess what? You have to watch the same ads later. 

There should be a per episode quota that’s never exceeded."
2018-10-26 20:42:32,Start up,1,Gorilla manSARM2,False,"For some reason, recently I’ve been having to deal with a lot of playback issues. I’m not able to watch really anything and it’s constantly just on a loading screen after I select anything. Sometimes I get the pop up that just has me exit and try again, sometimes it offers to retry but that never works. Even closing the app and opening it up doesn’t help. Consequently, I’ve had to delete the app and re-download it, sign back in and then that works, for the first I’ve signed in. Then it doesn’t work once I leave the app. It’s really inconvenient and i would hope that it’s not something to do with my WiFi connection and my phone"
2018-05-28 02:14:58,Stop changing the format!,1,Ash3891,False,"Stop  making changes to something that was working fine! For us users that are not using the live tv it is rather inconvenient and unnecessary! I hate that when I click on the episode I want I get a list of what to watch next! I do not need nor want you to give me a list of what to watch! It is completely unnecessary and should definitely go back to the way it was! If you are going to give options of rewind and fast forward then the users should be able to choose the time, also it would be nice to have an option to make an episode as watched instead of having to fast forward through an entire episode."
2018-04-29 05:57:21,Exiting a video,2,Juicy1643,False,"You can’t. The exit arrow doesn’t react. Or you end up clicking the WATCH NEXT video be it’s a millimeter away for the exit arrow. Then some random show ends up in my lineup the rest of my life. Come on guys. The arrow was fine before. You’re changing all the wrong things. Listen to your reviews. I pay$144 a year to you guys. I shouldn’t have to close the app and reopen it just to get to choose what I want to watch. Also, the app logs out of my account nearly every day, why? What is the point? And I agree with the reviews on the hypersensitivity of the fastforward rewind activity. It’s annoying. 
I’m not mad, guys. I’m just disappointed."
2018-01-29 17:20:39,It barely even works,1,The Geniusman,False,"The app just doesn’t do what it’s supposed to do. It loses place in shows and movies. Audio from ads plays over the shows. Video will sometimes disappear after commercial breaks. Subtitles turn on and off randomly, regardless of settings. Picture-in-picture mode doesn’t work on iPad. 

The one thing it’s supposed to do is play video, and I have yet to get through a single episode of Sunny without having to quit the app and restart playback because the screen went blank, ad audio is playing, and the subtitles to the show I’m supposed to be watching have turned themselves on somehow.

It’s just not good. Doesn’t perform its most basic function."

Interesting part is that all other apps load and run without me getting this message.  I have also shut down all apps running in the background.  Ugh!!!!!!!

I also would like to see a better and more accurate search function and suggested choices not made by my gender.  No other choice is given when you sign other than select ""male"" or ""female"", and you must pick.  I don't want a bunch of chick flic suggestions.  I pick movies based upon my interest and not my gender.  Ugh!!!! Again!!!!!!"

This is the only app on my phone that is this way. I have looked for a fix or something to change in the settings, but I am unable to find anything on my iPhone X. I have the most current ios. If you could fix this issue then my rating would go to 5 stars. I even tried contacting customer support, but then they told me to restart my phone and let them know after I did, and then the chat was closed."
2019-10-01 23:07:40,Advertisements,2,Vintage60s,False,"What on Earth are these ad placements. There can be an advertisement at the end of the show that will be 90 seconds long. Start the next episode and immediately you’re met with 30 seconds of advertisements. Can it not be changed to every 20 minutes of show time you are hit with 2 minutes of ads or something. Worst of all, the keep watching feature is awful. Did you just happen to exit your show after finishing ads? Guess what! You will be set back 5-10 minutes from your previous spot and be forced to watch those same advertisements AGAIN!!"
2018-07-19 17:42:24,Live TV has more trouble than it’s worth,1,KarenMcR,False,"July, 2018. App seems worse not better. It seems to get an error playing video exit message every time I use it. I have even run it without any other apps and after reboot. Live tv is not worth the cost. 

I’ve been a customer for years. I’m supposed to have no commercials except of course there are a few exceptions. Most of my recorded content has commercials. I thought it was just CBS which is ok, but now it’s even the stupid stuff on HGTV or food network too. I’m not sure what I’m paying for these days. 

I have a great signal in the house yet when playing live tv it buffers, gets audio over audio, does not go back to place if you get out of show, crashes consistently, and even doesn’t know I’m signed in until I close app and try again. It’s gotten too frustrating now that I’m checking out some of the other services.   It is better on a computer but the whole idea was to watch tv on iPads. 

I hope this turns around as every update seems worse not better."
2018-05-23 07:31:00,Worst user experience on earth,1,Missodessa,False,Whoever designed the UI layout for this app needs to be fired. It takes too many clicks to get to a shows page and watch the episode that I want. When watching a show after it’s over the next episode doesn’t play an episode for an entirely different show that I don’t even want to watch starts playing and then there is no way to Click the back button to get back to the shows episodes. The interface for this app is just so horrible I cannot see myself paying for a subscription I’ll just wait for somebody else to Upload episodes of the handmaids tale online. That’s really the only good show you guys have anyways.
2018-03-27 17:34:21,Broken seeking and ads makes it nigh unusable.,1,I Remember This,False,"Often you'll be watching a show and tap the screen trying to pause it.  Inexplicably, the app will send you to a different point in the show, earlier or later than where you were.

The gesture that causes this is hard to replicate, making it difficult to return to where you were.  Worst of all, even if you manage to return immediately to where you were, all of the ads you'd already seen play again.  No mercy: did you just finish the 90 seconds of ads to return to the show, and accidentally swipe to earlier in the show?  Hope you enjoy watching those 90 seconds of ads again."
2017-10-03 15:09:05,Horrible update,1,Dunwhit94,False,"I am really getting sick of being in the middle of watching a show, pausing it and then it rewinding or fast forward to random points in episode just from touching the screen. This has happened with almost every single episode I have watched since the update and it is extremely frustrating having to fast forward or rewind. Another thing that is missing is the little preview box that shows what scene you are fast forwarding to. Now that's gone so it takes forever randomly moving through show until you get lucky enough to find your place. Please update and fix this. It's making it watching any show extremely tedious."
2018-02-12 08:17:08,I don’t understand the motives behind this app?,5,Hate.it.or.rate.it.,False,"why wouldn’t you guys sync the profiles between the web browser and the app? like I can’t even find what episode I was on on the app because they’re totally separate. it’s not user friendly at all. and that’s if I can even find my show because apparently I have to save it twice, on my computer AND on my phone?? why would you force the user to do that? it doesn’t make any sense???"
2020-09-15 22:49:01,Chromecast Functions “Spotty” at best.,1,isntitaaronic,False,"I’ve been trying to watch 1 episode and I’ve had an incredibly difficult and frustrating time playing it, reconnecting, getting error codes and finally during an ad break, having to fast forward through ads I already watched because the episode would start over. 
I can’t switch apps because it’ll disconnect. I can’t let me phone go into standby mode because it’ll disconnect. It’s a poor attempt at using a robust system (Chromecast) to watch entertainment. 
I don’t have these issues with various other entertainment apps (or, at least, not to the extent of this) so I am not sure what gives. 

Hope this helps."
2020-08-03 14:06:39,So much potential but so disappointing,3,Chaoticfish,False,"This app is missing the most simple things that are so disappointing especially for the price: 

1. Live stream tv hangs, jumps around and just simply fails, all while phone sitting untouched on table. 
2. App often hangs on streaming causing me to shut it and reopen to make it play. 
3. Why on earth can I not view live tv on portrait without the list of stations showing? I can’t tell you how easy it is to carefully move my *mobile device* and still inadvertently change the channel. Very annoying. 
4. Why can’t I have a locked screen and continue to listen? I would like to carry my *mobile device* while using my subscription but for reasons outlined above often get frustrated and give up. 

Note that I am playing on solid WiFi network so no excuses there. 

This seems so simple to address. I hope to see some positive changes very soon."
2020-04-28 11:06:40,I can’t open it!,1,Diana L Alexander,False,"I can no longer open the app! It simply crashes and kicks me out. All of my devices are doing that and it’s really frustrating because I’m not paying you guys a monthly subscription so that your app doesn’t even work! I want this fixed!!
I keep reading all of these terrible reviews, but I haven’t had a problem like the ones I’ve read from other people. And then today, the app won’t even open. I just want the app to work like it should, just like every month you take a payment from me for the subscription, I would like for the app to work properly too. I would greatly appreciate you looking into this ASAP!!! Like today!"
2020-04-17 01:46:17,Has some flaws,4,Tykieriah,False,I love this app but it definitely has some flaws all week I can watch maybe one or two episodes of a show and then a error message will pop up where I have to complete exit out the app and try again and sometimes that still doesn’t allow me to continue. Today was the worse tho it stopped working on me about 5 hrs ago and I still can’t continue the episode I left off so I’m not sure when it’s going to be back up and running
2019-10-04 20:56:06,UPDATE FAIL,1,Aevali,False,"UPDATE FAIL!

Latest update makes it so NO episodes you watch are actually marked as watched. For me this is a HUGE problem. Especially because it erases the bar that shows how far you were in. Making it pretty hard to know if you’ve watched a show or not.

I will be cancelling if this isn’t fixed. ALSO they need a button you can click to say if you’ve already watched previous episodes. For example; I watched SNL (Saturday night live) and when I first signed up I started in the middle of last season. Now that I’m caught up it still tells me I’m behind like 17 episodes which I’m not. It’s really annoying for someone like me who enjoys organization."
2019-06-02 04:14:10,Frequent errors,4,Nate Previti,False,"The app is easy to use and even has live TV. It keeps shows and movies on a lot longer than Netflix but I keep getting frequent errors that force me to exit the app and restart it. My original review was 1/5 stars because it got to the point where the videos wouldn’t even start loading, but that was solved my restarting my phone. My review isn’t any lower than 4/5 stars since the frequent errors are more of an inconvenience. It stills needs to be fixed though"
2019-04-23 17:00:55,It’s a really good app but there are a few issues,3,El Dirado,False,You should stop making so many of the shows live TV access only some of those shows that say live TV only aren’t even on the air anymore for example speed racer the next generation is a show that ended a very long time ago I doubt they’re showing it on live TV anywhere also a lot of shows I used to watch at one time weren’t live tv only ex Lucifer I used to watch this all the time and now I cant anymore as a loyal customer I would like to see this fixed as soon as possible
2018-07-12 19:06:05,Why pay if we get so many commercials,4,S0uls,False,So I’ve been using this for about a year and a half and it’s great because it’s plenty of shows and movies but the only thing l hate is all the commercials like we already pay for the app it’s not like this is a free app . l had to watch a 3 part movie that had 8 commercials in each and every one it’s very annoying sometimes l just cut I‎t off mid way through but still it’s a good app because we get definitely more shows that actually play on tv
2017-10-14 16:34:19,All it does is say “an error occurred.  Try later.”,5,mendicants,False,"That’s all this app will do on my iPad Pro.  Tried all recommended fixes.  Delete app.  Restart iPad.  Change password.  RE download app.  Nothing worked.  Plus, I called support, waited forever, only to have them say “this is a known bug.  Engineering is working on it.  Call back this afternoon.”  5 days later, no fix.  This app truly deserves 0 stars, or negative stars since it takes so much time to do nothing."
2018-01-12 10:15:15,Ok,3,phoebegssjsh,False,"Not the worst app out there (that award goes to Tumblr). Generally it works fine, and the new update looks nice, but my major problem with it is the rewinding/fast forwarding thing. It’s way to easy to skip forward or rewind (that is to say, I keep accidentally touching the screen and causing it to fast forward or rewind, and then having no idea where I left off). This is incredibly annoying, and I often am forced to watch through the commercials again in order to get back to the spot I was at in the show/movie before I accidentally fast forwarded or rewound."
2018-12-10 03:55:15,Amazing stuff!!,5,Popin piggy,False,"In my personal opinion, way better than Netflix. The selection is wider, it’s much easier to access the shows that you’ve saved to your list, even the sound quality is better. Additionally, Netflix has started putting ads onto their service. Lastly, Hulu’s anime selection is insane! From the stuff everyone has heard of, like Naruto and Dragonball, to some more underground works: Jojo’s Bizarre Adventure, Samurai Champloo, Inuyasha, Noragami etc."
2017-10-14 03:00:25,Video watching screen,4,Tejon123,False,"I cannot tell you how many times I have been watching a tv show and I accidentally switch to the episode next and I’m completely lost and it gives away giant spoilers, this has happened an excessive amount of times and recently it randomly took me to the final episode and killed the series. Please change the way it looks. No flip tray or fancy words or actions like flip tray and the video skimming action (that’s a whole other terror) just stick to the basics to try to be so fancy"
2020-02-09 13:28:51,Your app is trash scumbags!!,1,CDesty19,False,"If only there was a way to rate this piece of crap 0 stars I would gladly rate this load of garbage a big 0! 3 ads at once everytime and I still have to pay for it? What a load of bull crap, especially 45$ to watch everything?! Yeah no, you are legit greedy rotten pricks. If anyone should be paying anything more than a penny, 0 ads should be included. It’s messed up how corrupted you people are. If anyone’s interested in this app and you see my review I hoped this helped. Highly highly HIGHLY don’t recommend this app to anyone, huge rip off and worst experience of a app. Go with a better app like Netflix or any other ad free app that only has one plan."
2019-01-11 16:07:40,Casting issue,2,GrimpyP,False,"Haven’t seen this issue anywhere else, but here goes:
While chromecasting from my iPhone, the phone appears to be running the show separately, on itself, delayed. So I’m hearing the sound of the phone playing, delayed by minutes, at the same time as my tv is playing it, and no amount of volume switching and restarting will fix it. It began doing this, occasionally six months ago or so, but resolved itself for no clear reason. Tried deleting and reloading the app when it started happening again but it didn’t help. 
Can’t continue like this. I’ll just quit if it keeps up."
2018-01-19 01:12:11,Having problems with subtitles/caption,5,Wendolyne- seafood,False,I love this app. But for the last two days I haven’t been able to watch my show because the subtitle button doesn’t work. I’ve tried deleting the app and downloading it again. It worked yesterday but today it’s not. It’s frustrating not been able to watch my show. I’m a bit disappointed. If I’m unable to watch it then I’ll have to cancel my subscription. 😕
2018-10-18 22:27:17,Wanting to watch a show only for a message to appear saying error try again later,2,Mel2019,False,I try to watch a show that I like and it works fine for a while but every so often it will completely stop working and not only the show I’m watching everything I try to watch a video and a message pops up saying that there is an error and to try again later or watch something else it is very annoying and I hope there is a fix to this because I have already refreshed and uninstalled and installed the app again and there is no change hopefully they’ll fix it.
2018-07-20 16:19:11,Constant Issues,2,Linzee Brower,False,"I have this app on my smart phone and my smart tv. I’m having issues right now with my phone. When I try to play an episode, it won’t. I hit the play button and it acts like its trying to play and then it stops and the play button pops up again. Over and over and over again. I can’t watch it at all right now. I have issues with the app on my TV too. Half of the time I get an error message and then I have to back all the way out and open it again. NetFlix doesn’t have any of these issues. Do better, please. I’m not paying for something I can’t use half of the time."
2018-05-23 17:11:30,The worst,1,kk7474837,False,"I’ve been trying to watch the same episode for the past few days. Yes. It takes that king to get through a 30 minute episode. I get through maybe 2 mins then I get a “connection error” and have to restart. Then when I did get reconnected I have to watch a commercial then the episode starts from the beginning. It never picks up where I left off even though it tells me to “resume episode”. So annoying. I never have issues with Netflix.
Update: app still doesn’t work after the update. It constantly tells me I have a connection error then restarts the episode. It’s an endless loop! I’m basically paying to just watch commercials."
2018-05-10 02:21:23,Fast forward and rewind are horrible,1,NicknamesAreSoUseless,False,"Fast forward and rewind features are probably the worst I’ve ever experienced and they haven’t been fixed the entire time I’ve used this app. What makes this worse is if you either rewind 10 seconds to catch something you missed or your finger slides and suddenly you’re taken all the way back to a commercial break and have to watch the whole thing over again. Let me be clear, at no point have I EVER wanted to rewind back to a commercial (their presence isn’t exactly endearing the app to me either but that’s another issue). I honestly can’t wait to find my next show on Netflix so I don’t have to deal with this anymore."
2020-03-24 01:52:52,Just one problem I have!,5,Cookies Crumble,False,So I adore this app I love it and I will continue using it but my only problem is that I can’t set a profile password cause I have people just logging into my profile and watch stuff that I have on my list or change my name for no reason so I’d really like a response if you’re going to add a password for a profile in the settings or if not do you guys mind telling me why? Thank you love the app though!!.
2018-01-05 18:22:02,The new version,1,April Harden,False,I hate the new version u can’t fast forward through commercials. There there it’s still an inconvenience that the commercials are there even if I have to fast forward so y can’t I? When I rewind if I get back to a commercial I can’t fast forward back to where I was n I should be able to I’ve already watched the commercial. The app should realize that I have seen the commercial and have rewinds in order for me to pass it when I have gone back too far. If you touch anywhere on the screen the show goes to that point when you should only be able to move it using the scroll bar and the buttons. It’s too sensitive. I hate it!
2017-11-02 21:36:37,Beyond frustrating,1,•••addicted•••,False,"First off, the rewind feature is awful. Please go back to a bar at the bottom like everyone else! I accidentally skip/rewind all the time and have to watch multiple commercials to get back to where I was.

My main issue with this app though is the fact that it won't play on my tv with my Apple HDMI adapter. It plays like it should for a few seconds, then the screen goes black. The sound and captions still work, and the network logo is still at the bottom. All of my other streaming apps work fine. 

There are so many other minor issues with this app, but if you could just fix these two, I could deal with the rest."
2017-09-09 11:20:23,Put Picture in Picture BACK!😡😡😡😡,1,Akhtggh,False,"It's bad enough that when you did have it on Picture in Picture did NOT automatically start playing the next episode of your show like Netflix does VERY successfully. But now you took it away entirely WITHOUT warning?! I would never have updated the app if I had known. Unless you want all of your iOS customers to cancel their subscription I humbly suggest you both put it back immediately AND make it work correctly when watching shows that have episodes. 😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡
September 9, 2017 update fixes.... the font! How about fixing that lack of Picture in Picture we've already been complaining about?!?!?!"
2020-06-03 15:24:41,Nice service - Horrible App!!!,2,C.Cook jr,False,I have used the app for more than a year on my iOS devices.    TV app on my a Roku based TV works without any problems.      Enter this app.     Constantly have issues.    While watching livetv you try to switch to a different channel and it pauses.  You hit play and it plays the original channel.    Over and over.     Only way to fix it is to completely close the app and relaunch it.    Then 10-15 minutes later it’s back to not working.     Beautiful.   All of your updates continually make this worse and worse to use.    At this point it’s barely functional.
2019-06-29 04:22:26,Great Except One Problem,5,Daisy113756,False,"The app is really pretty and easy to navigate. I love how many shows are here that aren’t on Netflix. The only issue I’ve noticed is that I’m having problems syncing(?) my account between my phone and TV. If I watch a handful of episodes on my phone then switch to my TV, it’s like I never watched those few episodes. It gets pretty annoying especially if I start to binge watch something."
2020-03-19 03:38:34,I’M SICK OF IT,2,Tired Hulu Customer,False,"It is the third time y’all have let just anyone change my password. They don’t even need my email address or anything and y’all won’t let me reset it. Every time I call customer support I’m just told I can get a refund. It is exhausting to try and guess my new password every time just anyone wants to change it.

And can we fix the whole problem if I scroll back on accident I have to watch a whole new 90 second add. If I miss what they are saying and rewind a little too far back, guess what, ANOTHER 90 SECOND ADD.  I know I’m not paying for premium or anything but I’m still a paying customer."
2018-01-23 18:14:25,This App has so many bugs they need to hire a exterminator!,5,Whataday23,False,"I wish I was able to use this application on my large 12.9 iPad. But to be honest I can’t even sign in it states continuously regardless of uninstall,reinstall, restore to iPad, setup as new. That there is no server available. All I want to do is watch my favorite shows on the go and use this platform to do it. To be brutally honest I’ve been going to the Netflix app instead. Please fix this app."
2019-02-24 00:13:54,Where's the value?,1,Mystic1492,False,"I was reluctant to pay a monthly fee for content that was available over the air and online for free, but I understood the convenience of mobile access was worth something.  However, once I found out that there were ads (lots of them) I was completely perplexed.  $7.99 / month to have free content delivered to my iPhone and iPad and I still have to watch ads???

Update:  It's nearly impossible to seek and find the point you left off since seeking past the point of an ad throws the app into an irrecoverable tailspin.  No only are the ads ridiculous for paid content, but they also constantly crash the app.  What a piece of junk."
2018-05-30 22:13:41,Fix 5.23.1 update,2,MGDerpness112,False,"Ever since last update you can’t pick just a single season of any show to watch. Whatever season you pick it’s gonna show you all the seasons and available episodes without any order. 

Next issue is on going for a long time 
Live tv and recorded shows are hard to watch. Even with high speed WiFi it seams sound loads faster than picture so at one point you are getting multiple and distorted sounds which follows with fast forward of the show to catch up with sound which results in skipping about 2 minutes of the show each time it happens."
2018-05-20 15:02:49,Sooooooo frustrating!,1,MadMomTickedOff,False,"It just shuts down completely while watching a show. That is, if I can even get a show to play in the first place. It loads and loads and loads and loads and then times out. Then tells you to close out and restart so I go through it all over again. And this happens 5 or 6 times before I can get a show to play. Then when you watch an episode and wait for the next one to start it just shuts down and makes you go through the whole process again. It’s the worst system I’ve ever used. If any other app had the same tv show selection to pick from I would be done with this stupid app in a heartbeat."
2018-02-27 05:00:34,Just doesn’t play at all anymore.,1,oberon526,False,"Doesn’t matter what show I choose; doesn’t matter if it’s on phone or iPad; doesn’t matter what quality setting it’s on; doesn’t matter if it’s on cell or WiFi service— the video just sits to the loading symbol. Forever. Until my phone goes to sleep. 
This time, out of sheer stubbornness I tried to wait it out. 40 minutes and the video never loaded. This has been for over a month. 
I tried to go to my account online and place my account on hold as a result. If you hit “Hold Your Subscription”— what a surprise, the screen goes blank and then takes you back to your account. You can’t even do that."
2019-04-13 18:01:18,"Good, but could be a lot better for live tv",3,mikescelly,False,"This app works well and I don’t have too many issues with it. But, it still has a ways to go to be user friendly for watching live tv. Please add a favorite channels list to the live TV guide that users can customize with only the channels they want to see in the live TV guide. This would greatly improve the channel searching on the current live TV guide. Currently you need to scroll line by line down to the channel you’d like and they are in alphabetical order making certain channels a chore to get to."
2019-02-18 11:10:15,Ads,1,Hsixh52728,False,"I’m wasting my money to watch more ads than the show itself. At least Netflix can d something right and that’s make people happy even if they don’t AS good of shows. I hate seeing 90 second ads when all I’ve seen is 3 minutes of my show. Not just that, the ads are boring and don’t target the audience on what each individual would prefer like every other streaming service. And this isn’t a ad complaint but the movies on here are quiet trash. You’re better off with any other streaming service to get actual movies worth seeing from young o old audiences. Be ready for Disney’s new stream service, your money is better there than here."
2019-02-09 19:41:53,Not very good.,2,Technolaten,False,"If you accidentally touch the screen, it may fast forward or back a lot and you have to rewatch more ads for no reason. It wouldn’t be that hard to introduce a slider to fast forward like nearly every similar app. Sure it would be more similar to Netflix, but that wouldn’t at all be a bad thing. Also, there shouldn’t be this many ads if you’re paying as much as the normal rate costs. There isn’t an easy way to browse much of the content. I don’t know if there’s just not a lot on the app or if they don’t show you most of the things, either way it could be fixed."
2018-09-29 10:46:54,This app has so many issues,1,Bubblerug,False,"This app is actual trash. Constantly saying there’s a problem with the net work or saying my account doesn’t have access(even though I do and just watched the show). Every time I click show details the app says “unnamed server error” so I can’t even pick which episode to watch. It crashes all the time. You all need to step your game it. I’d delete the app and keep it that way if Netflix had the show you all did. Take notes from them, their app is flawless.

I would also like to know which editor picked this so I never download another one the “editors choice” apps again. That editor doesn’t know what he’s talking about"

At first I thought maybe it was a connectivity issue, but I always have strong signal strength so that can’t be it. I have even tried restarting the app, making sure it’s the most recent version, deleting and redownloading, everything I can think of, and it still happens. I’m so fed up. I’m about to just say forget it and cancel my service and go back to only Netflix, at least the don’t drop in the middle of a show every 5 minutes."

The video keeps playing but there’s no sound. I can’t here what anyone is saying!! It’s extremely frustrating!! 
Second: the video freezes but the sound track keeps going. I have to pause the show and walk away and hope that when I come back to it it will play like it’s supposed to. Again very frustrating, annoying, and inconvenient. Please fix ASAP!!!"
2018-05-14 18:23:09,iPhone X,4,Marcoseus,True,"Hi, it would be extremely nice if you add iPhone X screen compatibility, it would be so nice to watch content without wasting screen real estate, is like watching in an iPhone 6,7 or 8.
Hardly use the app on my phone anymore because of that, coming from an iPhone 7+ seems like a downgrade on your app.

Edit:Thanks for the update, the content looks great using the full iPhone X screen.
No problem with the new* user interface, just a little bit of use to get accustomed to it.

Second Edit: You just botched this app with todays update. Now there is a black line under the content, meaning content is cropped up and down.
Heads and feet are cut. 
Please, all that new player thing wasn't necessary.
I don't know who was asking for this features, that make the app a downgrade again. From 4 stars to 1.

Third edit: Problem fixed, thanks."
2018-01-25 15:44:23,Please Fix,1,1stWorldAnnoyed,False,"The user interface concerning the fast-forward and rewinding is extremely flawed. A stray touch shouldn't change the time elapsed in the video. Stop trying to be unnecessarily innovative and stick to what works. Also, there are some serious glitches in my app. The screen will pause as the audio continues to play or the audio will be played at normal speed while the visual is shown at high speed. I've deleted and re-downloaded, rebooted my phone, and paired down on quality and features such as subtitles. Doubt that this complaint will make any difference, but I thought that at least it should be brought to your attention."

I looked at it and saw that it was going to be almost 60 dollars a month. That is completely unreasonable and to me overly expensive, and now I can’t watch the show I really want to watch. For now I will have to wait for it to come on Disney+. And also the fact that you also have to pay for it to not have adds! And if you don’t it’s I think 100 seconds! That is absolutely insane!!

If you have already watched an episode an go to rewatch it, it skips to the last 5 minutes. So you have to rewind it as if it were a vhs tape. The commercials are now in random spots of the show. Sometimes right in the middle of lines. And most of the ads don’t even work. They just play half of the add and then it jumps back into the show often having skipped a minute or two. I’m sure you clients would like to know they are paying full price for add slots and your company is only running half the ad. 😂👃$"

Once again I honestly love this app i just want to know whats going on like is it because to many people are on at once and like to many downloads of this app or are there just bugs in the system?
2019-10-25 04:19:33,"Love the app, except..",3,abbycarlton,False,"This app is convenient and great like any other streaming app. My biggest problem with the app is when I get notifications for new episodes of “my shows” AFTER I’ve watched the newest one. I want to know that morning that it’s uploaded, or if I’ve already watched it then I don’t need the notification. Maybe that’s a personalization feature to look into instead of mass push notifications, but it’s frustrating getting a “new episode is available” notification when it’s no longer helpful."
2018-12-08 04:02:06,Picture freezes and audio keeps playing,3,AdrianneL,False,"I used to not have any problems with the app. Now, more and more, the audio keeps playing but the picture freezes. At first I’d just rewind 10 seconds and it would get back on track. But today I’ve had to do it 4 times in a row then exit the episode to get it back on track, only for it to freeze again moments later. If it’s an internet speed issue, I’d rather have to wait for it to buffer rather than listening to a scene without seeing a matching picture."

I have full bars/service and still always encounter an error which makes the video I’m watching close out. Can’t you just keep buffering like Netflix does instead of the stupid prompt that closes the video out? 

Got to the point where I was just going to cancel my service but they gave me a free month. Hope in this free month you guys fix this app because if not I most definitely will cancel my subscription."

I deleted this app from my phone for maybe about 2 months (a little while back) due to my shows being on a break; and now it won't even start playing a show! I just keep watching the dial spin in circles..... 😡😡😡 it's really annoying! It blames my internet connection, but yet I have full WiFi bars and connected just fine. What is wrong with this app now?! FIX THIS APP PLEASE?! Otherwise I guess I will have to find a new app to watch my shows after they air on tv... VERY DISAPPOINTED!! I would have given it ZERO STARS if they would let me!"
2018-01-18 17:00:43,Where are the subtitles?!,3,Heatherandj218,False,"I finally got used to the updated format. I don’t like it, but I’m used to it. And now I have no subtitles?!?! When I look at the setting for subtitles, all options are greyed out and cannot be selected. The only thing I can do is tap accessibility settings, which puts me over to my iPad settings. I found the subtitle thingy there, turned everything in, still nothing. So I turned my iPad off and on, thinking maybe it’s one of those settings that doesn’t come into effect until the device is reset. Nope! Still no subtitles. Not cool."
2017-09-19 06:06:38,New interface is ridiculous,1,yrmdt,False,"Why mess up a perfectly good thing? Since the app redesign, you have to go through several steps to get to what you're looking for. Instead of having everything at a glance on a home page, the full screen is taken up by featured content, and you might as well give up trying to navigate to your favorite shows - better luck searching because everything is buried several layers deep. I have yet to successfully pick up watching a show where I left off. It's like they took the worst, most frustrating website you've ever visited, and turned it into an app. Useless and completely counter-intuitive."
2020-03-18 15:56:31,Overall Ok but still having error message,3,NewUser202074,False,"The app works, sound & closed captioning are fine. I been having a issue every time I finish a show, I select another to watch, it keeps saying there is an error. I have deleted the app and downloaded again, still doing it. The only fix is to shut down my iPad and then reboot, but then I am back to only being able to watch one show and then the error is back. This just started a few weeks back. Please fix, if there is an update let me know."
2020-02-28 19:48:30,Can’t watch on my laptop or phone,1,fixthisfcknshitasap,False,"When I try to watch on my phone it’s gives an error message saying “we’re having trouble loading this right now” check internet connection, my internet connection is fine!!, and when I try to watch on my laptop it literally doesn’t allow me to browse shows telling me to start a subscription WHILE I am SIGNED IN, and not due for another payment until MARCH 25th. I pretty much waisted my money paying for another month because your system is not even recognizing that I already have a paid subscription that is up to date!!! This is so annoying and needs to be fixed!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2020-02-23 04:07:31,Great! But...,4,JBearkat,False,"The app is great everywhere including on my PlayStation. But it is frustrating when I have to skip over intros and recaps. Out of all the streaming services I use this is the only one that doesn’t have the capability to skip intros and recaps with just the tap I’ve a button. Everything else is great and well thought out, but if u can make this one little fix it has the potential to make your app 100x better, it is a worth while addition so please consider it!"
2019-12-17 08:21:10,ADD THE SHOW THAT WAS ON NICK @ night called “ hollywood heights “,4,Graceland kelly,False,okay so there’s this show that came out years ago... and it was so good.. but you can’t find it anywhere at all or watch it absolutely anywhere since it was on teen nick years ago and nick @ night BUT it would be highly appreciated if you added it.. the show is called “ hollywood heights “ a lot of people don’t know about it but it’s such an amazing show and it would be pretty dope if you added it on the app (: thank you i hope you guys see this
2019-01-17 13:50:43,Scrap new format of home page,4,Yaharalady,False,"First off the app’s performance has improved with new updates. Thank you....BUT. I hate the new home screen. I don’t want to scroll thru a bunch of screens to find the latest new episodes of my favorite shows. Scrolling takes time. I liked the old view (where many different shows were shown at once. )better. 

One show per page is poor use of screen space. Please change back or give settings options."
2018-12-28 13:08:51,Enough with the commercials,3,dewhip23,False,"Enjoying the shows but the commercials are obnoxious. There are several breaks through the show. If you need to rewind you have to watch them all over again. Better to put them in the beginning if your going to force us to watch them and stop interrupting the show. Also, it’s not super easy to navigate. Started watching series 2 because I couldn’t find series 1 and having difficulty with getting from one episode to another. Could be a little bit friendlier."
2018-02-21 11:17:18,Mirroring compatibility,3,Lizzmariet,False,The app before the switch to the “My Stuff” update was beautifully compatible with Apple TV screen mirroring. It used to actually open the app on the tv and play content very well without the phone having to be open. It would be really great to get that back. Also it would be great to have a way to manually import from a watchlist because I have a watchlist on one device and my stuff on another and no updates for the watchlist device so it gets a little hard to keep up with what’s in my list.
2018-03-21 16:31:21,Sorry to say I hate it now...,1,Witzorsa,False,"I can’t stand this app as it stands. Everything with your updated/reimagined layout and usability is really terrible. There is probably not one new feature that I like and see as an improvement. The skipping forward and back when you touch the sides of the screen is an awful feature. I feel like people are screaming it all through the reviews, yet you keep the feature. 

Also, I used to see all these shows in one place, and the shows I watched were all right there, up front. Now sometimes, I have to go all over the place to find I show I watch ALL THE TIME!

I also hate that I have to press a bunch of things to go to the details for the show, when it used to take us there by default.

This whole app is worse now. It was great before, very user friendly and simple. Then, you thought you were making it amazing, and really...you broke it. It seems like you changed things just to change them, and few like it. I hope it gets better."
2017-09-25 06:31:38,HATE the App!,1,jasmaniandevilx,False,"I absolutely haaaaate this new update. The colors may be prettier, but every ""improvement"" is anything but. I appreciate the suggested shows, but that should not be on the first page; yes, I prefer instant access to ""Continue Watching."" Scrolling is now impossible, and just tapping the wrong area on the screen forwards to the end of an episode/movie. I've never had to track what minute and second I'm at while watching an episode as much as with this app. Please go back to the drawing board from the last version as that was easy, user-friendly, and clean. This is messy and makes streaming a difficult experience, which is pretty hard to do."
2017-09-19 01:45:28,Horrible New Interface,1,Roxie5ever,False,"The new set up is so difficult to use and not intuitive at all! I'm a 24 yr old college student I can't figure out how to find the list of all my shows like I used to. I can't see if there's new episodes for shows I've subscribed to. The pastel color backgrounds just add to the confusion. I just want my shows! Easiest way for me to find them is to search for them all over again. As a premium member, stuff like this might make me quit paying. Seeing one show in your screen is horrible and t doesn't say if it's been watched or not already either. The app is even worse on my Fire stick tv and it's frustrating."
2017-10-04 15:03:01,I’m so Bummed. 😪,5,Exciting :) :),False,I love the new update but I’m not happy that I can’t watch my shows on my tv I usually connect it to my hdmi cord so I can watch movies and stuff with my family actually it does work when connected but it only lets me see commercials and not the actual shows please fix it and I also wish you can frequently update the Kardashians shows more often like the other episodes on here.
2020-09-28 18:17:10,Fix the app or no longer say you can download and watch,1,STRLESS,False,"Fix the app or no longer say you can download and watch shows and movies. It’s been over 2 months since I’ve been able to use the download and watch feature, it shows the intro of the company (example-fox) then it just buffers and buffers and then crashes. I even download over WiFi and still have this issue and I’m getting sick of it. Either fix it or state that you no longer supply the download feature because it’s false advertising. Your company is getting worse and worse after you actually were working well last year."
2020-04-28 12:14:16,The Crash,4,Mac.I 27,False,"The app is amazing for my type of content being anime and the occasional tv series, nothing ever the top like live shows but that all doesn’t matter since I can’t OPEN THE APP itself. If I tap to open that app it’ll show Hulu’s loading screen and back out immediately after. I like this app for what it provides but please fix this glitch cause it’s not my phone acting weird. The app itself just refuses to let me past the loading screen into my stuff."
2019-06-23 06:49:54,"New interface loses my subscription. cancelled, I have my limits",1,theOtherWB,False,"I keep thinking, “this can’t be the app...  this is a beta... this is..  awful”. The search engine is inane.  Seriously, get it together... charging for something where a recently watched list isn’t even handy?  Where now, NO list is handy... I have to scroll through each show individually with zero idea of what you have for content?? Are you kidding me??  The latest version actually makes me angry... search and scroll at the same time?  Through what??  I mean, you’re the one subscription I can live without...  I know I’m not alone, and how you keep a five star rating has to be rigged...."
2017-11-06 01:58:58,Horrible update,1,Cancerchick1982,False,"**** Edit: so picture in picture is back. BUT THE RIDICULOUS FLIPTRAY IS STILL THERE. This is ridiculous. Remove the pointless most frustrating streaming feature ever.****
Why update to make it prettier then take away a key feature like picture in picture? Then add the stupid skip ahead crap. Now if I barely miss the pause button it skips waaaaayyyy ahead and makes me sit through 90 seconds of commercials before I can try to rewind to watch yet another 90 seconds of commercials just to see that I went back too far or not enough and have to sit through more commercials. If this isn't fixed soon I will be cancelling my subscription."
2020-04-28 12:36:47,Glitches,3,starr monae,False,I gave this app three stars because i downloaded it last night & renewed my subscription. The app was working  perfectly fine last night and now all of a sudden it wont open. I deleted it and downloaded it again and still the same results. I am not going to pay for the app and pay to watch something i cant see !! Whats the point in that ? Please get it together its not fair for me to pay for the app and pay for my subscription but I'm not able to watch my shows on my tablet.
2019-10-04 21:29:40,Adware...,2,rockwatched2,False,"The worst implementation and the worst experience. You are getting their service to watch Ads. Completely useless for mobile watchers. Once the connection drops you just going to watch the ads over and over again. The problem is that when you want to swipe through, you hit the add and if you get offline in this process, you going to just spin until a min worth of ad is done. Worst is when the ad itself doesn’t load after watching the ad for 45seconds and you have to rewatch the whole ad again when your signal connects."
2018-05-09 04:42:57,Updates aren’t fixing problems,1,Swagger45,False,"The app design is terrible and I wait for the updates in hopes of fixing the constant problems but every time I’m disappointed. It’s time for me to unsubscribe and go elsewhere. The fast forward and rewind are the worse. I will pause, but somehow it thinks I want to FF or RW and I lose my place. My other dislike feature is after a movie or show is complete and I try to touch screen to select the back arrow, nothing happens. The display will only appear and disappear. Can’t select the back icon, settings, nothing. Sorry I gave it multiple tries, after my subscription is due I will be spending my money elsewhere."
2017-12-22 02:55:36,"SO ANNOYING, NEEDS CHANGES",1,16373833948484478,False,"How about changing the way I fast fwd and rewind!? I want to be able to touch the screen WITHOUT doing so!! All I tried to do was brighten my screen and instead of bringing the menu up, I fast fwd and have to wait for stupid buffering AND a stupid commercial. All because you can do it by touching the screen ANYWHERE?? Come on! Change that crap to just a bar so we KNOW WHERE NOT TO TOUCH to do so!!! And eliminate the dang countdown to commercials!!!! That is so annoying!! You guys need to learn how to keep it efficient. Stop messing everything up! Whatever rating that is bad enough to get you to pay attention, count this as that! Just be more like Netflix"
2020-10-10 02:44:53,Unbelievably atrocious UI,1,iphonereviewer#2,False,"20 year DirecTV user forced to switch because I’ll be mobile for the next 10 months, so I sign up for Hulu’s Live TV service. This is absolutely the worst UI I have ever had the misfortune of using. I cannot find any way to get to a particular show that I wish to record from Live TV except for scrolling to find that station, then sliding to the right ONE HOUR AT A TIME until I locate the show I’m looking for, then I can record it. This is freaking insane.  They’ve never heard of a search field for live TV or a more intelligent way to list programs?  It’s slow and cumbersome, and I can’t wait until I’m able to dump this service!"
2020-09-07 23:25:27,New 7.8 Version needs work,4,Gamester69,False,"I just downloaded and installed the 7.8, and when ever I go into the new app, I see the content, but when I click on the play button all that happens is that the play button bar blinks to acknowledge I clicked it and doesn’t play the respective video.  I uninstalled,
Re-installed and logged in, and even rebooted after the re-install and it still does the frustrating not playing of the video content.  Please fix.  Thanks!"
2020-04-27 01:16:31,Frustrating!,3,NayaraW,False,"i enjoy watching shows and movies on the app but sometimes i’ll accidentally slip my finger on my screen and then suddenly i’m minutes back or forward in my movie. It is SO ANNOYING and then once i try to go back to where i was it takes FOREVER to load. like any other streaming app i don't click anywhere on the screen to fast forward through my video, i have to actually click on the bar. when it’s like that i don’t accidentally skip forward, it’s 100 times better."
2019-06-29 18:37:31,getting better,3,$oftfe@ther,False,"unikitty is back, but is missing part of season one and doesnt even have season 2. craig of the creek still isnt on there so i cant watch it! the amazing world of gumball is getting its sixth season soon, thats good. star vs. the forces of evil got season four recently which is good but it came almost a MONTH after the finale aired, which is kind of annoying. i still want seasons 1-29 on the simpsons, yet you do not provide. teen titans go! should have season four soon, i want it. its getting better but pleez add whats missing for a five-star review!"
2019-05-21 17:17:09,The commercials,4,YungSkywalker551,False,"I feel like this app is great, it has nice amount of tv shows and movies to select from. The problem comes in when your so into the show that your watching and a minute long commercial come on that happens at least four times while watching a tv show. If you’ll be able to get rid of the commercials or at least make them appear less while watching this app would definitely be 5 stars."
2018-02-13 18:10:11,Consistently won’t recognize mobile app,4,Smxx,False,I have tried to open the app on my phone repeatedly and about 25 percent of the time I can actually get in. It says there’s something wrong with my internet connection and there’s not. Restarting the phone the internet or the app doesn’t change the issue. I was able to use this well up until a couple weeks ago. I hope there is a fix as I really have lost all use of the app at the point.
2020-07-11 19:57:38,Great but not working,3,Bg43421,False,I love using this app it’s my main source for movies/shows HOWEVER within the past couple weeks I am completely unable to chrome cast to my tv. My screen says ready to cast but then it just keeps buffering from my phone. It works fine if i’m watching from my phone by not if I want to cast it. This is very frustrating. I’ve tried reinstalling the app and reconnecting my wifi but nothing is working. I’ve also heard other people experiencing the same problem. Please fix this.
2020-08-20 22:16:30,Just Use Netflix Guys,1,Jaddrgbxdhkpphc,False,"This app is a money hungry and it shows. You have to suffer through ads for more than 70 seconds 5 or 6 times for every one episode you watch. And you have to pay for an even more expensive plan to get rid of ads and to fully access all content. To top it all off, the subscription that includes ads has insufferable glitches, for example, freezing after an ad just so you can watch them all over again after having to reload the show. The only reason I used the app in the first place is for the content. I hope the shows and movies on here get moved to Netflix."
2020-03-27 04:18:07,Glitchy,3,iwannatouchonyou,False,Im constantly having to kill the app right after an episode ends bc for some reason it keeps saying it’s having trouble loading or connecting. And multiple times in a video the video will visually skip ahead but the audio stay the same pace making it out of sync and vice verse. And it takes over 10 mins to load most of the time and I keep having to switch between WiFi and my service provider to try and get it to actually load. It’s severely frustrating.
2020-01-13 02:56:20,Eh.,3,meh1920,False,"So I binged the first season of a show and they don’t have season two but they have season three. Which is fine I guess, but it didn’t tell me that, it just started playing season three automatically and I didn’t realize it until they were referring to certain things from season two and it spoiled everything. Boo. Also, if I exit in the middle of an episode, it doesn’t remember where I am when I start the app again and I have to fast forward and try to figure it out. Good variety though."
2019-11-09 22:38:07,New bugs are making the app unusable.,3,wendolynaragon,False,"I can’t pause anything without issues. Once I hit play again, there’s no sound. Or it makes me go back to the beginning of the program and when I try to back to where I left off, it freezes and then gives me an error message. I signed up for the Live TV version without commercials after getting rid of my much pricier cable. I was hoping it would be better, it’s not. I’ve restarted the app, my iPad, and even reinstalled. Nothing has changed."
2019-05-11 04:50:16,screen freezes,5,txmhxllnd,False,"Good so far, except the screen started freezing when i got halfway through an episode of CSI. I tried to use my data to see if it was just the WiFi connection, but it still froze. It would get about halfway and if i try to close the episode and open it again, then the episode starts over again.

Soooo, idk what’s wrong with it, but please fix it thank you!"
2019-11-09 07:17:39,Worst streaming app,1,MiladiaM,False,I don’t want to give this app one star but the way I see and compare it to other streaming app it’s the worst. First it’s super complicated to go through episodes and you don’t have the next episode or list of episode option when you watching something. The ads for the shows are too much. To watch a 24 minutes episode you will go through 6 minutes ads even when you’re a subscriber. The ads getting more and more with each update! Also when you have the app in smaller window it will automatically close when the episode finished which I wished it wasn’t like that!
2020-01-21 15:46:02,Why am I forced to watch so many ads,5,Kmartin11201995,False,There’s probably 15+ ads per episode. If I wanted to watch tv I would pay the outrageous prices for it. There’s no point in watching anymore. I have lost all interest in my shows. Maybe if there were considerably LESS ADS it wouldn’t be so bad. I’m so frustrated I can’t go 5 minutes without having to put my phone down and wait for the ads to end.
2018-05-14 21:08:55,FF/RW and ads,1,spencerhoop,False,"I don’t like that I have to watch ads on a paid service anyway, but when touching the screen accidentally makes you not only lose your place, but also have to sit through up to 2 min of ads just to try to track down where you left off. Horribly inconvenient. Scrolling through one show at a time when selecting shows is also just a bad design decision. Wanna go back to the last episode and watch the last 5 minutes again? First you gotta watch ads at the start of the show, then ads again once you skip forward. I don’t wanna watch 5 min of ads to see 5 min of my show. Terrible UI."
2018-05-09 01:53:53,Good and Bad,2,This guy (;,False,"I like how the new update makes you hold down on the screen in order to move forward or back. That used to be a pain in the a**. But what I don’t like is the fact that the 10 seconds forward button is now 30 seconds. Like, sometimes I miss just a bit of whatever I’m watching and rewind 10 seconds and if I want to go forward I’d miss more than necessary bc it’s 30 seconds. It’s a small problem but would make a big difference, at least for me. Maybe give us the option to choose how many seconds we want in the settings or something."
2018-02-26 04:10:05,So far big disappointment,1,Desiloohoo,False,"First off, it takes FOREVER to load a show. Then about 15 seconds into it, it stops to buffer for two to three minutes, then plays for 20-30 seconds then stops to buffer again. And again. Aaaand again. It’s almost impossible to watch anything because of all the buffering. I tried resetting out networks..  no help, then I tried to ask support and it doesn’t go through just sends me off into dead air. Tried reloading page, will not work. For the lack of support/troubleshooting offered and the constant buffering ... should get half a star. Fix the bugs and I’ll gladly change my rating."
2017-12-14 04:00:39,Not intuitive,1,Yangblo,False,"They need ability to skip to next episode or to any other episode while watching a series. What’s frustrating is when you click on a show and it continues where you may have left off, but if you already saw the episode and can’t find the controls to go to the next episode. It’s so freaking frustrating! You have to close out of the video, go to the main page and click the little ellipses to get a little white pop up window show up, then click the show name, then it will take you to the shows page, then you can click the episode tab and pick an episode. f@#$%!!!"
2017-12-07 22:48:37,FF/RW Feature is THE WORST,1,SeantyelH,False,"I never rate apps really, but I came here specifically to complain about this extremely annoying fast forward and rewind feature. Anytime you accidentally tap the screen, it jumps to that spot in the show. Other users have taken more time to explain this feature, but basically everyone hates it. If the developers are listening AT ALL they’ll get rid of that feature. If I need to FF or RW I can drag at the bottom of the screen like any other video player, but if I tap at the top of the screen or pick up my iPad and my finger accidentally taps the screen I don’t want it jumping to that spot in the show. It’s way too sensitive! Ugh!"
2017-11-23 01:01:47,App is ok but.......,3,LadyCapricorn09,False,"It needs work!!! I was having issues with it freezing but after the update it’s working a lot better. I’m wondering where is season 3 of Growing up Hiphop? Also, where is season 2 through 5 of Marriage bootcamp? How do you just skip through seasons of shows or only show certain seasons? Please fix! Also, Can you add Growing up Hiphop: Atlanta. Other than that I like the app. 

P.S. please add more networks like TV one centric, and own network shows, and show every season of shows that’s already on the app and more to come. Thanks!"
2017-11-03 10:02:12,Horrible update,1,Cerealkelr,False,"I updated my app as usual, but am very displeased with that decision.  I got used to how my shows are organized (but don’t like it) but cannot stand the new fast forward and rewind functions. I watch from my phone and it seems every time I accidentally hit the screen when watching a show it assumes I want to fast forward or go back and most the time I don’t!  I have the commercial plan so when I try to get back to where I was it forces me to watch 40 seconds of commercials even if I had just seen a commercial break.  It’s really frustrating.  I don’t see what was wrong with the old way of fast forward and rewinding."
2020-07-12 09:22:12,"Good service, terrible app",2,Viking24601,False,"The app frequently glitches and stops videos, claiming you should reset your router and you have to shut the app down and reopen it. It also is extremely slow downloading episodes even with strong WiFi (like only 2-3 episodes overnight), doesn’t download seasons in order (and you can’t pause downloads to redirect downloading for earlier ones, only cancel), and will randomly tell you you “don’t have permission to access” some episodes, again making you click ‘retry download’, whereupon they download with no problem."
2020-04-28 10:04:08,No support when there’s a problem,1,SkateboardOH,False,"I was using the app, no problem. Finished a program, closed the app, got a prompt for an update, ran the update, tried to open the app, it will not open at all, and the “help” options are a joke, when you try to call or chat the wait times are phenomenal and after over an hour on hold you mysteriously get disconnected, (multiple times), and my computer has been waiting for a live chat response for over 21 hours with a screen that says “Expected wait time 30 minutes”
The service is great until there’s a problem, then you’re apparently on your own."
2018-08-29 23:59:27,Bugs Continue,5,Lucky3Rabbit,False,"I have to continually un-and-re install the application on a daily basis due to program errors. The video will play as usual, then, the moment I touch the rewind or fast forward button, the screen will disappear, yet the sound will continue. The only way I’ve been able to rectify the issue is by un-and-re installing every time this happens. It’s daunting and quite frustrating."
2019-11-16 01:49:22,Always starts me at the wrong place,3,1010Cam1010,False,"Pretty good show options. My huge complaint though is that when I go to watch a show I was previously watching, it very often starts me behind where I actually was. Then I have to find where I actually was, usually a commercial or 2 ahead, I have to rewatch all the commercials, and I’m annoyed by the end of it. I honestly feel like it’s their way of getting more money by making us watch more commercials. I never was started at the wrong place on Netflix’s app."
2019-08-13 06:17:26,Connection error keeps reoccurring,3,B33333zzz,False,"During the advertisements, it starts to buffer and then after it stops buffering it starts to say “Connection error” once that happens you can either say “ok” or “retry” after pressing retry it starts to buffer again only for the connection error to pop back up, and ok just takes you to the home screen..I know it’s not my internet because it happens wherever I am using the internet on my tablet..This is causing the app to be very aggravating and not fond of watching anymore."
2019-02-13 09:00:13,A few suggestions,1,Yeaa.tiji,False,"Overall this a pretty good streaming service very affordable very good with watching new episodes. I have a suggestion however, a shuffle button I think it would really come in handy for shows everyone’s seen beginning to end such as full house, family matters, so you can watch the show but with some variety you know a little of everything. Also I should not have to wait 20 seconds for my next show to begin playing maybe ten, twenty is just outrageous. Another suggestion I have playlists  for shows. Anyways keep up the good work guys and seriously consider the shuffle button."
2018-05-08 18:36:56,Terrible update.,5,Peetsosweet,False,The video on an iPhone X is not centered on the display. Also trying to tap the back button when you reach the end of an episode does not work. The only way to get out is to force quit the app. Also I will go to open the app and it will ask me to sign in and if I close the app and re open it I’m signed in. This level of incompetence in a company this experienced is disappointing.
2018-06-12 03:34:21,crashes CONSTANTLY,2,hfk821,False,"i use this app to watch on my google chrome cast. almost everyday the app will crash for about an hour. if i’m trying to fast forward to a certain part of an episode i’ve started watching it will keep starting the episode over and over until i close the app and ill have to rewatch the entire episode. 
for the quality content that’s on the app, i’ve always had trouble with this app running well. it’s been very frustrating... 
please someone fix it. especially since i PAY to watch the content, i expect better quality."
2018-03-28 10:11:38,This App is inaccessible for blind and visually impaired users,4,OneParticularParrothead,False,"With the most recent update, the only thing that blind and visually impaired users who use voiceover can do is brows. It is my hope that the developers will move forward with making this app completely accessible for blind and visually impaired users. This app has been inaccessible for blind and visually impaired users for months, and many people have complained. I do not feel that we are asking very much to have this app work for us."
2018-04-22 17:43:08,Latest update has ruined it,2,SupermomSays,False,"The most recent update completely changed the interface and has ruined the whole watching experience. Slow, clunky, and filled with glitches. If it isn’t resolved soon, I’ll cancel my account and hope to return later if this mess is ever resolved. Super disappointing.

Updated March 1: new update, still slow and awful. Not worth it.

Updated April 22: now the app requires me to login almost daily. Super annoying. And everything else lowsy about it remains. Only reason I’m sticking around: season 2 of handmaids is coming in a few days."
2017-12-28 12:39:55,Love the update!,5,Trivie,False,"Don’t give much mind to these traditional tv watchers who need a guide and channel list to watch TV. I love the new UI and so do my kids. It always has my shows ready, I never have to search for what I need, it’s press and play, and it always remembers my place. It’s a different interface yes. But don’t be afraid of change. Please keep adapting this interface. It’s not perfect but it’s miles ahead of the other services."
2018-01-23 05:43:00,Watchlist tab,2,FCCbbb,False,"The keep watching tab is so difficult to use now that it is full screen. I have missed out on most of a season of one of my favorite shows because I didn’t realize it had come back from break since it wasn’t in keep watching or a watch list despite it being added to my list. Very frustrating since I probably won’t be able to watch it before the next season premiers and the current season is taken down.

Please please take down the full screen design that makes the app not functional and frustrating."
2018-01-19 03:03:02,Captions don’t work and can’t lock phone to listen to tv show,1,victorsv1993,False,"I loved netflix for the purpose of being able to listen to shows or movies while my phone was locked. You guys had the feature then took it away. Brought it back. Then took it away again. Haven’t seen it since! And the newest update. My captions NEVER work anymore. I’m just tired of your constant updates that do NOTHING to make the app better for your customers. In case you haven’t seen, people keep rating your app 1-2 stars. When will ya’ll actually listen to the paying customers and release a good update for once with friendly user interface?"
2017-12-03 03:02:23,Very disappointed in this update,5,ch. hchcjdj,False,"When the update released I had to spend 15 minutes reentering my account Info then I had to go through every single show in the app saying witch ones I like and wanted to add to my watchlist 

The update didn’t save nothing from before so I didn’t know where I left off on episodes and of course the infamous “click to time in video” feature"
2017-12-22 02:11:33,SO ANNOYING,1,xxbbnn,False,The time swipe feature is infuriating. You can accidentally tap on the screen and it takes you 30 minutes forward and you have to swipe through to figure out where you are again. It's happened 5 to 10 times in one episode for me. You can accidentally swipe to halfway through the next episode and not even realize it. The browsing feature is annoying. You can hardly find anything anymore. You have to click through 5 pages just to get to a list of episodes in a show. You've sacrificed usability to make it look more ~aesthetically pleasing~. Fix your stupid app.
2020-09-01 13:50:38,Think it needs an update,3,Snake_Wrangler,False,"So generally, if I’m binging, the first episode is fine and I can watch with no problems. However, it has a problem playing every episode after that. If I press play next or just let the episode play through and go to the next episode automatically, it gives me an error message. Says it had trouble loading the title. So I have to close out of the show and then restart it from the main screen again. It’s just kind of inconvenient."
2020-07-31 17:49:43,New Layout is such an Improvement,4,LeslieAnnnie,False,"So far, the new layout is miles ahead of the previous layout. I don’t really understand why anyone would prefer the previous one. I think people must have just been used to the disfunction. Now it has anything I watched recently in the keep watching category instead of randomly leaving some series out so I had to go to my list or find the episode by wading through the seasons."
2020-04-16 04:02:54,Really good but...,3,has a lot of problems,False,OK let me just start off by saying this is the better version of Netflix it has more shows less original stuff or more things I would want to watch but I’m having a few glitches it might be my phone but I don’t know but after I’m done watching an episode of regular show the screen freezes on the logo of the show and I had to close out the app and open it again to fix it I’m not sure if anyone else is having this problem but it won’t stop for me
2020-02-22 17:18:20,Need ‘mark as watched’,2,Darchrow,False,"This app needs a Mark As Watched function because it is constantly marking many episodes I’ve watched as not. Because of this it won’t inform me of new available episodes. Also, when I want to revisit and re-binge other series; after it completes an episode and it rolls over to next, that next episode begins at the end and so it practically rolls over to the next episode thus skipping an entire episode. Seems like a basic enough function that doesn’t need to be mentioned in the 21st century. Maybe if streaming technology were new but....IT’S NOT NEW."
2019-03-10 04:32:29,Terrible,2,ShoobyTaylor,False,"I don’t understand how an app this terrible has 5 stars. Something is EXTREMELY suspect about that.

Why do I have to tediously flip through one full-screen show title at a time?

Why are new episodes of shows I watch all the time buried where I can’t find them, but it tries first to get me to rewatch episodes I’ve watched already, or start again at the beginning of series I’ve already seen?

I only watch a couple things, why is it so hard to figure that out, and show me the new episodes of those things before trying to get me to re-watch things? Why does it bury them under “TV”, instead of under “keep watching”?

Why can’t it figure out, if the phone is sideways, I want to watch full-screen?

Why does it take so many clicks to find what I was watching yesterday so I can resume it, meanwhile, first it wants to make me click past me shows I have never had any interest in?

I hate this app."
2019-02-22 00:50:46,Wow 😳,3,lucycheer,False,"Ok to start of with , I love this app it has all the new shows to catch up on. I love how you can get many old shows too! But , I have a few Concerns .one of them being that sometimes the show will just stop and say please try again later we can’t play this show that frustrates me when I want to watch tv .another that it take to long to load .so In the mornings I only have a few minutes to watch and it will take most to load.  overall this is s great app but it needs some updates and"
2018-06-18 17:27:40,Terrible,1,Islandberg,False,"I will definitely be canceling my subscription and deleting the app after the World Cup. I wanted a way to watch the games while I was at work. First I had to come to terms with the $40/month price tag, second I had to come to terms with the fact that the app crashes and is constantly buffering regardless of my location. I thought, ok maybe it’s my WiFi. But it isn’t. Everything else on my phone or other devices works perfectly fine, but not this app. Ready to delete after day two of using it. Haven’t been able to watch a single thing without the program crashing, live and not."
2018-04-27 17:58:22,Mixed results in update,3,"Matt P - MD, USA",False,"The latest update brings welcome improvements to the UX with improved control with gestures for scrubbing forward and back, as well as the forward jump being changed from 10 to 30 seconds. Much better for skipping anime opening credit sequences!

Unfortunately it's really unstable when casting to my chromecast, so I have to kill the app and restart pretty often after my phone locks. It also really won't ever get above three stars until they add offline viewing for shows."
2018-04-07 02:01:59,Wasted two hours of my life.,1,blinky_poo,False,"Downloaded this app this morning to try it out. Set up a trail month through iTunes subscription and received a confirmation of such through iTunes email. Attempted to login on computer and couldn’t. Attempted password reset and nothing. Eventually had to call... waiting on hold 30 minutes to get someone on the phone who had NO IDEA! what an iTunes subscription was or that you could set their product up with it. Was on the phone an hour and a half with multiple other departments consulted before they were even able to just FIND MY ACCOUNT. 

This is awful. Don’t waste your time."
2018-03-01 22:42:27,Too many issues,2,Liv0712,False,"I hate the format of this app. I love the shows, but honestly it’s getting too annoying to use. The rewind/fast forward feature is horrendous. If you even just barely tap on another part of the screen by accident the show jumps and you have to go through all the commercials again. Plus load time is ridiculously slow. If I pause the show to check another app, I come back and it takes 15 minutes to load back up to play. And it’s NOT a data issue. On average it takes me an hour to watch a 25 minute show."
2018-01-14 02:27:08,Awful UX/UI Design,1,Erahrah,False,"This interface is designed to make it more difficult to find shows and navigate within a show once you are watching. I am considering canceling the service it is so terrible. If you want to pause or jump back/forward in a show, you are likely to jump far ahead or back because the entire screen except for a small area in the middle controls where you are in the show. It should not require such precision to simply pause or jump back 15 seconds. And requiring you to scroll through a full screen shown icons to find what you want to watch is maddening. Truly awful update."
2017-10-13 01:21:19,Picture in picture,5,csims860715,False,With this new update it lost the picture in picture. Before it was changed I was able to start whatever it was that I was watching and go off and do something else on my iPad as well. Now I can no longer do that. If the picture in picture is brought back in a new updated then I might come back and give it a higher rating.
2017-11-06 06:30:26,Bring Back HDMI Support!!!!,1,Lily6112,False,I love the update!!! Very visually appealing and easy to navigate but you guys removed HDMI support!!! Why would you do this!!!! I live in a rural area where I can’t get any internet so I use my mobile device with an HMDI converter cable or use Apple TV mirroring to watch our favorite shows as family!!! I can’t do this anymore the commercials will appear and work just fine but the program is black with only sound!! This doesn’t work to be paying for something that I can longer use with my family to watch!!! We can’t all sit around to watch a movie on a small phone screen!!! I would hate to cancel please fix!!!!
2017-09-17 23:39:51,Too Many Bugs,2,Ghost8456,False,Whenever I'm watching a show the next episode it tells me to watch is always the episode that I just watched or a previous episode. It's so annoying and sometimes when I start up the app and try to watch something it will jut freeze and do nothing. Also the new video scroll bar is so stupid. Sometimes I will accidentally tap and then it goes all the way to the start. They should have just kept it normal like every other streaming service. The look of the update is good but it's filled with bugs and horrible features.:
2020-07-21 20:26:55,Poorly designed layout,2,badhuluemployee609,False,The interface of this app is atrocious. Why is it that when I select series details it doesn’t show me the full list of episodes instead it shows me other shows to watch so I’m stuck on one episode. Also if I go to rewatch the show it always starts at the very end of that episode. Why is it that my continue watching isn’t the first thing that I see when I open the app? The app has no time limit I could fall asleep watching a show and wake up eight hours later and my screen is still on on a different show.
2020-04-29 05:16:07,The update broke this app,5,Patrick G Woods,False,"Updated Review: App is fixed so I wanted to update my review to be 5 star, thank you guys. I left my old review below.

I own an iPhone X, latest iOS, there should be more testing when updating your app, it says the update was for the removal of bugs however it seems to have just added bugs to a perfectly fine app. I will update review after this is fixed."
2019-02-23 03:54:24,Great app that has improved over time,5,Will 89 89,False,"This app was pretty bad a little while ago.  It is a great app now, and they have removed all the old bugs.  It has much better content than Netflix has, and it looks much better than Netflix.  The improvement I’ve seen with this app is incredible, and now I can watch their better content library on a better app than Netflix."
2019-12-19 02:29:37,Duplicate commercials,3,Neigh91,False,Same as everyone else on here. One you rewind it makes you watch the dame 80secs of commercials again. Or if you leave the app it starts about 30secs before you left off.....and plays commercials again. I don’t have this problem that I noticed on a tv. But being an NA I watch most shows when I can I’m incumbents on my app. Hoping all these reviews fix this problem or they’re going to lose customers. Not fair to watch 80secs of commercials just for pausing or rewinding sirs and ma’am’s.
2019-06-28 20:32:06,Subtitles not working all the time.,2,PyrollisAhFiros,False,"Loaded an episode only to see that the subtitles isn’t on so I went to settings to turn it on. It was actually on then I had to toggle it off then back on to get it to work. When I’m done with that episode, it goes to the next episode and then the subtitles doesn’t show up. Again, I went to settings to turn it on, but it was already on so I did the toggle off/on again and it came back on. The issue still persists after going through 10 episodes so clearly there’s an issue with the subtitles. Please fix."
2018-11-25 22:34:57,IPad app doesn’t work,5,g-b,False,"I hope the developers start paying attention to these reviews. The content is great but I’ve never been able to watch live programming on my iPad. (Tech support had no knowledge of the problem.) I understand that they want to protect their product, but how long can they protect it from paying customers? For now, I’ll keep downloading the iPad upgrade and keep hoping."
2018-03-09 23:10:30,"Would of given a 5,if::?",5,Spirit 1-4-18,False,"Would of given 5 stars, but the screen is very sensitive to any touch and will either go back or forth, depending on where you accidentally touch. If they could put the play/rewind/forward buttons at the bottom next to the time remaining, that would be great. It’s getting so annoying, that if it’s not planning to change, I will cancel my account!"
2018-03-31 23:51:31,What is with the fast forward😠,2,Dfladge,False,"I can’t get my head around why the fast forward is as it is. You touch the screen slightly and you’ve jumped to the end of the episode. I get it developers, it looks cool, just like the new iPhone (without a home button) looks cool. But is it practical? No. No one other video streaming service will ever be like this in the future, so go back to the way it was because it’s a chore having to constantly rewind.

All in all go back to the old interface. I know you won’t but I thought , I a faithful customer, might make my complaints known."
2017-10-18 15:25:58,WHAT HAVE YOU DONE!?!?,5,CindyStuff,False,"This “update” is AWFUL! I came to App Store to figure out if I could go back to old version. Seriously, give back the screens of selections! One screen per show is seriously taxing. Also, what happened to the ability to watch in small screen so you can have another application active?

This wasn’t an improvement. It’s awful. I will be cancelling.

Directions: Go to Netflix. Copy them. Rinse. Repeat."
2018-02-17 04:01:00,SFB,3,SFBANAK,False,"Watching Olympics and titles onLive viewing & on demand are often inaccurate once I click on the video or live show icon. Men’s Freestyle Ice Skating Live finished on one icon & then that was gone. The others said hockey & hockey & another title but no figure skating identified. FINALLY, I found it under one of the Live files but there was no file for figure skating - hidden in “Men’s Hockey: Canada vs. Czech Republic.” Please make these titles accurate so can find what looking for!!!!
Then “app feedback” is no such thing!! Can’t leave an email or message of any kind. Make this more easily obvious!!"
2017-11-22 16:52:06,Rewind/fast forward feature is awful,2,Ginnymenez,False,"Overall the app isn’t bad, but the rewind and fast forward feature is absolutely infuriating. Too many times have I tried to pause a show and accidentally hit slightly off  the button or my daughter will hit the screen causing me to jump to where ever was hit. More often than not this causes a commercial to start and I have to wait for a minute and a half to try and put my shoe back to where I left off. Hopefully they refine this a bit more so the viewing experience can be a little more streamlined."
2017-11-07 06:05:14,Hate the Redesign,1,Linnea [Loser*],False,"I used to be able to open up the app and continue watching the last episode I’d begun before with one tap. Now, even after all this time to get used to the new app, I’m still struggling to find my shows, it’s inconvenient to do so, and I have to have shows I don’t care about advertised to me on the front page.

This redesign was a huge step backward. The interface isn’t intuitive, and there’s hardly any information on any one screen.

I just want the primary focus to be to watch the shows that I like, and I’d rather be able to discover new things on demand. Right now it’s the other way around."
2017-10-04 02:43:00,Love the service!  Hate the new app.,5,Fritoman,False,"The previous application made a lot of sense and was EASY to navigate and understand.  This new version is the opposite so hopefully someone will fix it soon!

I still have the old app on a device and it has the list of all my favorite shows.  I looked on the new app and these choices are GONE.  It’s like they want me to switch to another provider.

I need a zero star choice."
2017-10-05 10:32:49,UPDATED REWIND/FASTFORDWARD FEATURE!!,2,urrwrecka,False,"I hate it with a passion!! Please please change it back!!

Since the new interface, every time I watch my shows on my iPad, I press ‘pause’ too long or accidentally press my screen for too long and end up either rewinding or fast forwarding thru my show, therefore having to scroll back to where I was and watching anotherrrr set of commercials.  I like the option to skip 10 seconds or rewind 10 seconds but being able to scroll “anywhere” on the screen is very frustrating for me.  

Please change it or fix it!  Please and thank you!!"
2020-07-11 07:13:33,Some issues,4,Schmebz,False,"(At the time of writing this) I have this issue with the app where it instantly crashes the moment I try to watch in wide screen. I only had this problem with the phone version, the tablet version seemed to be fine when I tried it out.

It’s a bit annoying when there is a message about not being able to forward past the intros of the shows channels that often last longer than the actual intro.

Sometimes after a show is over, the credits go on for a long while before I see the “watch next episode” button. Sometimes it doesn’t show up at all and have to wait until after all the credits are over.

I hope that at least the first one gets fixed so that this app is viable once again."
2020-10-08 15:55:08,Customer service is trash,1,Craigorythebarber,False,"Had serious issues with pausing live tv. When I would go to play after pausing, it would be green static snow and than go right back to live tv so I would miss everything from when it was paused. The customer service wanted to blame my att fiber optic 1000 internet which I know it wasn’t. Ran multiple connection tests and they were well above what is needed, including the latency. I ran there trouble shooting and it solved nothing. Yet every time I called customer service, this was the only thing they could do. Will never recommend to anyone based solely on the fact of the customer service."
2020-07-30 02:43:21,Ads and glitches,3,Randy ninja,False,"The ads are pretty annoying. It will not let me rewind behind the ad mark without rewatching the ad. If I press -10s and only 5s have passed since the ad, it throws me back into the ad and I have to wait 5s for it to end. And if I accidentally press the power button, the app decides “Guess I gotta die now” and crashes. Every. Single. Time. There’s also an input delay whenever I tap the screen. I have to wait 5s for it resize. There’s too many glitches on mobile but pc and console version works fine."
2020-03-14 18:39:04,"Good shows, live tv can be glitchy",4,FireofOden,False,This app has a lot of good shows that I like to watch and can’t find other places. Live tv is glitchy though if I am on one channel for too long I can’t switch because even if I do it freezes and reverts back to the last station but the right station is highlighted. Only way to get out is restart app. Removing app and reinstalling doesn’t help. This happens on other platforms as well like the Xbox 360.
2020-06-23 01:00:32,Good but irritating,3,workoqij,False,It has good shows but you have to watch like 80 second adds throughout the video like about 3-5 adds per episode and you can’t skip the adds it is really annoying but if you can be patient and wait the adds through it’s not that big of a problem. Also that doesn’t apply for the movies on this app because movies don’t have adds but even though I don’t like sitting through the adds where as for netflix they take out the adds.
2019-11-15 01:23:25,Horrible,1,Flakadawn,False,"I signed up for the cheap version with ads, and I could deal with that if you could actually watch something to the end without it kicking you off and saying to restart the app. Literally every time I watch something, either at home or on my phone, I’ve never gotten through an entire episode without this happening. I don’t know if this is their way of “forcing” people to pay for the upgraded version, or what. It’s not happening with me because I have zero faith in this app. The commercials are more frequent than basic TV, and if you have the audacity to try to rewind it, don’t bother."
2019-11-11 06:10:10,Terrible UI,1,Phit-est Dude,False,"Why is it so hard to find how to get to a show’s episode list? I shouldn’t have to jump through hoops (find and click a TINY “...” and then click “go to series details”) figure out how to access the seasons and episodes. It should be the first thing that comes up when you click on the show from the main menu. 
Make. It. Intuitive. C’mon, people.

Extremely annoying and difficult to navigate through shows— nothing about it is intuitive. I don’t care if Million Dollar Matchmaker is on in 800 seconds— get it off the screen! Accidentally scrub all the time. // UPDATE: This has been fixed."
2018-10-01 03:26:18,Please fix the crashes,5,Abed Cruz,False,Am having trouble with the app every night seen like there a time it crashes due to either volume of user or idk but now that I decide to add the tv services am not able to enjoy as I should. Everything works normally until 8 pm ish then it’s either network problems with I don’t have because all my other streaming services work fine
2019-10-09 05:05:55,Good but,4,ndbdnsbsjhfbf,False,For some reason after the recent update when I go to resume and episode that I haven’t finished it doesn’t let me start where I left off it brings back to episode 1 for said show. And the watch history doesn’t save as well. It’s as if I just started watching it the first time so each time I watch a new episode I either have to remember where I left off or scroll all the way to the episode I was watching. Pls fix
2019-05-01 23:38:23,Like it but.....,4,Lil kitten cat kitten,False,"I like this app but it needs a little work. Sometimes when I’m watching a show on my iPad like Austin and Ally and when I go and watch it on my tv it doesn’t save my progress! And about the skipping, why does it have to be 30 and 10? When I’m trying to skip the theme song part I always over skip cause of the 30 and the I have to go back and press the back buttoning 3 times, which is ridiculous! But over all like it."
2018-12-24 00:11:58,Bad with chromecast and bug with commercials,3,stathosmary,False,"Every time I synch with my chromecast from my phone, I am unable to play or pause from my phone or see what episode I am currently watching. 

Also, the number of commercials is crazy and they often reload so that I have to watch 3-4 minutes of commercials. On a 25 minute episode, I watch 5-6 commercial breaks that often reload 2-3 times per break. It’s crazy. Please fix this and give an option to watch extended commercials for a period of ad free viewing."
2018-12-22 22:52:00,Email unconfirmed,3,Sweetness Rush,False,"I was about to start my account to watch my shows, but I know I just have my email address on the account, but I forgot my password. I reset my password 2-3 times, and I didn’t get an response from them. I wish it didn’t effect others because of the email issues. One day “I’ve waited 15 minutes from Junk mail”, the other said “I can’t access to my account.” So I’m asking on behalf of the users to update the email problem so people need to reset their password."
2018-12-19 03:54:48,"Buggy, incredibly frustrating waste of time",1,H.T. Glover,False,"App crashes all the time forcing relaunches and doubling to tripling the number of ads one is forced to watch, which is even more maddening considering the fact that one must watch any advertisements at all when paying for this service. When restarting videos the app sometimes takes one several episodes back. Videos repeatedly lose sound also forcing reloads.  The navigation is also poorly designed and frustrating.  Not worth the time and effort one must expend trying to work around the numerous bugs.  Incredibly frustrating."
2018-11-11 03:21:53,Choosing an episode problem,2,spmiya2018,False,"I have no idea if this problem is happening to anyone else, so far the reviews I have read are not about this problem. The problem is when I click on a show I would like to watch, then I go to select an episode I want to see it doesn’t play the episode I clicked on, It doesn’t even act like I touched the screen. I can click on episodes over and over and nothing will happen, so I am forced to watch the show from episode one season one all the way to whatever episode I wanted to watch in the first place."
2018-09-11 03:59:34,Status info finally returns. Hallelujah!!!!,5,Prag mac´ tic,False,"Finally!! The absolutely necessary status bar display has returned. May it never vanish again!!

To be clear, the status bar info now shows appropriately after a single tap on the display when the rest of the controls and options appear and is appropriately completely invisible when in landscape viewing mode."
2018-02-02 03:48:00,Crash fest,3,Krys435,False,"I love the vast show options. I hate that it crashes ALL THE TIME.  In the span of one episode it is common for me to have to restart the app several times.  “Crashes” include: Audio for advertisements playing over the beginning of the show with out the ability to rewind. The audio being consistent while the video fast-forwards through half the show, after you have to manually rewind. While not touching my phone at all the video will jump by 5-20 min. Also it closes itself entirely."
2018-07-28 12:30:19,Missing episodes and uncomfortable ads,1,Clay Rudolph,False,"Some shows on this service have missing episodes. Sometimes an episode is just gone from Futurama. Sometimes it has the thumbnail of one episode and the description of a completely different episode! Another awful thing is the uncomfortable ads. I don’t care about Gaycation or Diane Black! I don’t have a problem with this show or Diane Black, it’s just that I come here to escape politics and the stress it brings. If there were some feature where I could block certain ads, that would be a nice accommodation to all the shilling this service does to its originals and sponsors. Thank you."
2018-07-10 17:59:50,Portrait mode is infuriating,1,Kalypso314,False,"There needs to be a way to opt out of portrait mode. If I move my device even slightly it flips out of landscape in the middle of a show and shows me a list of other episodes to watch (at least half of which I have no interest in). The browser seems to be incredibly sensitive, so much so that in the process of trying to flip my screen back to landscape I often accidentally start playing one of these other episodes. Did anyone test the UX of this feature? It’s obnoxious. At least give a full screen option so I can choose to stay in landscape for an entire episode."
2018-03-23 21:17:29,App is really bad,1,Chucky phucky,False,This is one of the worst streaming apps out of all the major streaming services. They just keep making it worse. First the way you fast forward/rewind is really bad and causes you to accidentally lose your place in an episode. It’s less sensitive than it used to be but it’s still a crap feature. Then with the latest update the shows your watching just disappear and you have to search for them. Or it shows there are new episodes when there aren’t and vice versa. The only good thing about it is the streaming quality itself is usually decent and doesn’t buffer too often.
2018-02-07 14:34:17,Voiceover support almost nonexistent.,1,Cmorrison0826,False,"Hello, I will probably be pulling my subscription soon because I am  unable to use this app.  As a totally blind user I need to be able to use the screen reader VoiceOver to interact with the items on the screen. Previously, I have been able to do this. However, in the last couple updates the app has become basically unusable.  Personally, I have a friend who has already left because of the same reason.   
If the support team would look into this issue it would be greatly appreciated.   I have enjoyed using this service in the past and would love to do so again."
2020-04-07 08:15:53,Can’t pick up where I left off,3,James90241,False,It doesn’t always pick up where I left off. It will play an episode I’ve already watched where I have a few minutes left at the end of the episode. It won’t pick up where I left off. I placed an episode on pause for a few minutes and when I hit play it took me all the way back to episode 1!!!! Why wouldn’t it remember where I last watched!!?? There needs to be an option to “Mark as watched” so it will not default to that same episode.
2017-10-02 22:06:25,Worst user interface,2,Livingak,False,After the most recent update you will start to wonder who the heck designed this and who the heck approved it! First off locating your shows is about next to impossible. Or even tying to find the episode you left off on. It’s has a slow response time and all around slow. The “my stuff” section doesn’t even show my “shows” which means I have to spend a stupid amount of time locating them. It’s a very frustrating update and I seem to be using it less and less. Which is disappointing since I do not have cable.
2020-08-20 03:21:52,Glitches and freezes,2,Jethro monnex,False,When watching a show the frame freezes at random intervals causing you to restart the app  and open it back up to find where you left off. Then after you’ve done that just wait about ten more minutes and you’ll have to do it again. This is insanely annoying. I enjoy the unique content on the platform but wish I could watch it without unnecessary interruptions that the developers are either too idiotic to realize their mistake or just simply not care for the user experience.
2019-02-28 00:24:16,"Works on iPhone, not Apple TV",3,Cyentruoc,False,"Installed the app on my phone and logged in just fine.  Apple TV says there is something wrong with internet connection, but how was I able to install the app if there is a problem?  Restarted Apple TV but still won’t work.  Uninstalled app and entered credentials again, still no luck.  Installed on firetv just fine and activated and was able to watch there, but want to use Apple TV.  Something funky with Apple TV app evidently but does not allow me to add comments there, so here I am...  fix Apple TV app."
2020-03-11 17:41:21,Can’t skip ads on recorded shows = huge flaw,2,ted40202020202,False,"As a sports fan this is really irritating. I have no problem with the ads on regular TV shows and stuff but when I record a game and play it back I should be able to skip around all I want.

At least make an algorithm that only allows these breaks to be unskippable every couple minutes or something. Because right now, if I want to skim through a game to find a certain moment, it’s impossible without having to watch 120-second commercial breaks back to back to back."
2019-03-24 06:31:23,Why is it so complicated?,2,cowtoe,False,I know what I want to watch I don’t need help deciding all I need is an easy to find categories button and when I’m playing a video the ability to push next. I know you have genres tab but the fact that is not easier to find is stupid not to not to mention when I’m watching a show and want to go to the next episode I don’t want to go back not if there is a listing tab right there. so why show me other stuff as opposed to what I’m currently watching. I mean I get it in small doses but your formatting is a little ridiculous.
2019-01-16 21:22:16,Worst app I’ve ever used!!,1,ghfvnu,False,There is no point in having this application on your phone because even with full 4G LTE service it will not load TV shows. I spend most of my time when using this app waiting for it to load even with full service and sometimes on Wi-Fi. It amazes me at how poorly this app was designed to work with the iPhone because I have the Netflix app and I can have only one bar of 3G and still be able to watch TV shows or movies with hardly no load time. Even though the app is free I still feel like it is a waste of money that is how poorly this app performs on the brand new iPhone XS max
2018-11-07 08:18:00,Overall: Pretty Good,5,J.M.L. The one and only,False,"It hasn’t given me any problems and it works pretty good. I might end up using it for a long time if it keeps up like how it is. Constructive Criticism: If they could fix the small amount of kids movies, that’d be ideal, but no other problems.

Also, if you want to watch an anime that’s great, Darling In The Franxx is a pretty good show. I recommend it. It does pass the 3-episode test even for me."
2018-11-17 20:07:37,Eh,1,cant sit here,False,"Too many commercials, not enough exclusive content, and very buggy. Continuous black buffering screen, no pic only audio, or show jumps for a few minutes and freezes if you go to home screen or another app like maps.  Majority of movies release the exact same day as prime (every new release...exact same day!) and if you have a tv provider then what really is the point besides the few original shows. I only use it because I travel a lot but it is always my last choice next to Netflix or prime, both without commercials... maybe Disney can fix these issues but until then 1 star."
2018-11-12 08:44:39,Limited commercials is a bunch of BS!,2,Lucilopez2000,False,On my plan on supposedly supposed to have limited commercials. But I’m only able to watch 2 minutes of the show and then I'm forced to watch 90 seconds of commercials up to 8 times in a 20 minute show. That’s more commercials than on actual tv!!! Are you kidding me?! And sometimes when the show is about to come back there’s some malfunction and the commercials start all over again. It’s ridiculous. This bug needs to be fixed and fast!! I am ambit paying for a subscription that makes false promises.
2018-04-11 00:43:10,Doesn’t work half the time but still charged for it,5,Tbone01231985,False,Hasn’t worked right for the last 2 months even though I’m paying for it.. gonna cancel soon don’t waste your time. Trying to play through tv using iPhone the tv gets sound but no pic even though everything else works I’m on.. I want my money back for the last 2-3 months I’ve wasted on this crap.
2018-08-16 15:08:49,Why have an account when I can’t even log in?,1,Neex1234567890,False,I know for sure that I have an account because it charges my card but I can’t get logged in. I forgot my password(which is surprising because I use the same few passwords for a few things) and I tried to do the reset link sent to email. I literally check all folders in my email and I know it’s the correct one because I put in my card number and it tells me that this email is the one used. I have not gotten a single email out of the dozen or so times I’ve tried to get a link sent... how do I cancel a subscription without having to log in??
2018-07-31 01:29:25,Problem,3,Shxhjsdnsokdjhcjggz,False,"So I love the app but when I watch a show or a movie it loads for 5 minuets then it plays for about 2 minuets and then it goes back to loading! Now I know what you are gonna say, “it’s your internet connection” but it’s not! How do I know that you ask, because I’m on my phones Data! And I’m being kicked out of my account all the time! All I’m asking is that if you could maybe please fix this problem or give me some help or advice on fixing the problem myself that would be great thanks!"
2018-07-21 22:53:46,Difficult to watch,3,Hi_its_ashley,False,"This app seems to give me as much trouble as it possibly can whenever I want to sit down to watch something. It gives me errors, switches the profile on me suddenly, sometimes the audio will work but the screen is black until I start the whole episode over, told me there was an error with my account even though there isn’t, and sometimes when I open a show it just won’t load until I close the whole app and try again."
2018-05-10 10:08:23,My Stuff Deleted !!!!! 😡,1,Xsonicxz2108,False,"This is the second time this stupid app deleted my added stuff to the list, that needs to stop each and every time this app prompts to you re-log I’m using your email and password out of the blue at it deletes your entire list of shows you added to watch on the list... that’s so aggravating for at times some of these shows I’ve already watched a few episodes so now I need to go through the list as what I need to add and some I don’t remember and even have to go through finding which episodes I’ve already watch sigh ... for something I pay for a month it’s ridiculous."
2018-01-02 14:06:44,Disappointing Redesign,4,Lucky_alf2,False,"Looks pretty but not user friendly. I used to be able to see “My List” of shows on any device/tv I was on easily — now that is gone so I have to search for the shows and apparently re-add them, am not sure if they have new episodes to watch or not, very frustrating and silly. What is the use of even having and managing a profile if you don’t share the watch list across devices."
2018-03-19 19:08:06,More Options,2,1KingNike,False,"After using this app for a year, I experienced so many bugs and errors. Give us a better experience with more options! If I have new profile that I didn’t want to have anymore… I should be able to delete that profile. For the help center and account information/ management, I shouldn’t have to go onto the website to find issues. Settings should give us information and customized controls to have a better experience within our profiles. For about, can there be tips on building a fun experience?"
2018-01-24 03:36:46,Irritating,2,Abbeychick345,False,I was in the middle of watching something and I ended up finishing the episode well the next one usually automatically starts but it wouldn’t so I clicked on it again and then it all of a sudden started acting really slow. I checked my other apps on my phone and they were perfectly fine. I closed out of the app and then went back in and it had logged me out. I went to log back in and it just keeps saying error. I then deleted the app and reinstalled it and when I went to go log in it still kept saying error.
2020-08-21 17:32:40,Fix the play/pause function mid-show please,4,ineverwritereviews..ever,False,"The play button doesn’t work when there’s a show going so I can’t cause it unless I exit the show. The fast forward button doesn’t work either. The rewind button does though and it’s extremely annoying. Please put the play/pause button back to the middle of the screen during a show, where it was before. It worked just fine."
2017-10-07 17:51:13,Get a new designer,1,Exit on true,False,"Just because you can do some web tricks with page flow doesn’t mean you should. The interface is now super clunky when looking through content, you see a VERY limited number of titles making it difficult to select what you want to be watching or even what is available.  Background images make text hard to see.  In short, everything you claim this interface will do to make it easier is a really bad assumption.  This is even worse on the Roku. Bite the bullet, dump the design and make a user friendly one that will actually accomplish what you thought this one would."
2020-09-15 15:22:32,Way to many ads!!!,3,Bsevrs,False,"I got this app on my tv a while ago but yesterday I got it on my iPad because I wanted to watch some anime but omg it’s impossible to rewind or just watch one clip without AD!  AD! AD! AD! like come on, there not even short and it’s really annoying but I have to say I love this app for watching anime -.- and it is a really good app just pleasee! Less ads! Like I don’t need a million. This is still a really good app just to many ads like I say ;-;. Anyways that’s all I have to say and you did a great job making this app!"
2019-07-26 15:43:35,Shows,4,Derekarnold,False,"Okay, so I love this app! But it doesn’t keep updated! A week ago, and season premiere aired, and I’m DYING to see it! But you have to add the content! I’m checking DAILY! And I noticed they don’t even have all of season one!!! 😖😣Also, you have to get a more expensive membership in order to see any show I know well. I have to watch shows I don’t know, or old shows nobody watches anymore! Get better content! (Disney, Nickelodeon) +, the update did nothing!"
2020-04-23 09:50:44,Has a few good shows,2,trsbguitars,False,"However, there are the issues: The app randomly closes on you. You are assaulted by ads before throughout and after watching anything. It gives you a chance once in a blue moon to watch a 3 minute ad and skip ads for that episode which is excessive but at least you can do something productive quick, however it gives you like 3 seconds to decide on that hardly better option and it’s only an option sometimes instead of being able to set as a default."
2020-02-28 03:42:33,Love it but I need one thing,3,Sweetheart719,False,"I love Hulu....I just really wish I could mark an episode or series as watched or unwatched, I’m re watching the golden girls but some episodes start at the end which is like the last 15seconds. There are some other shows that show some episodes as unwatched which makes no sense cause I’ve watched them all......This feature would be nice cause then I could keep my shows up to date and re watch with ease, let me know if this ever changes I’ll happily change that to 5 stars <3"
2019-10-27 01:39:19,Requires to many updates and doesnt always cast,2,tooo coool,False,The app needs to may updates does not always cast and i have a google cast tv. Great u can download stuff On the new version. Its like this app has constant bugs. The version on ipad2(yes the old ipads) was much better and reliable.  When u add premium the entire library for example starz will not carry over and uhave to log into their app to get full access to library. If ur device is low on memory and gb space app has ability to crash constantly. Downloads dont wanna play off line always get an error.
2019-10-11 01:22:35,Didappointed.,1,MaggieVicious,False,"The volume adjust feature is not perfect. Most times when I attempt to decrease volume it increases instead. It will not decrease the volume until I first increase then try to decrease again for the second time. Also, if I attempt to read about a listing I do not have a current subscription to, then it won’t allow me to further read about the details of it. This is pretty obnoxious. As I would like to read about something before I decide to purchase it. Even if I am only viewing it through a phone. Something should be provided for possible subscription content."
2019-09-28 16:28:51,No clock?,3,Lentiggini1,False,"I just upgraded to the iPhone 11 Pro. Something that’s incredibly frustrating that I didn’t have a problem with on my previous phone is that when I tap once on screen, I get the regular pause, forward, backward details but I’m missing the clock and WiFi/connection signal? I like to double check to make sure I’m on WiFi when I’m streaming and also check the clock easily. It’s very frustrating that this simple feature is gone. Please bring it back."
2019-06-05 02:08:13,To long of ads and way to many,5,Eggspin,False,I love this app soooooo much but I absolutely hate watching 80 second ads and there would also be like 6 ads In one episode It’s absolutely Insane you don’t need that many ads no ones gonna wanna watch anything on here If there’s that many ads like do one or two ads and make them like 7 seconds each like come on okay that’s It.🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬
2019-07-12 07:19:24,"I like the app, but...",4,vgs17,False,"Just in the past week or so (I assume after the last update), my app has been-
1. Keeping the bar up and open at the top, so I constantly see the time, battery percentage, etc. 
2. The feature that lets you double tap on either side of the screen to fast forward or rewind has stopped working. 
I know these are two minor things, but both things have made the app more annoying for me."
2019-06-24 20:27:12,One MAJOR problem,4,kg.validates,False,"I use this app a lot on my computer, and overall it’s a great app, but it’s honestly more like off-brand Netflix. It’s just not as good. It’s pumped with ads, with about 3-4 ad breaks that have 4 ads each time. When I’m trying to watch a 22 minute-long episode of a show, that means I only get about 5 and a half to 7 and a half minutes of showtime before another long ad break. FIX THIS it’s literally WORSE than regular cable tv!!!"
2018-10-23 06:37:33,Updates,5,Janieagles,False,I love the variety of shows and the quickness they are available to watch my only dislike is when they update the app seems to have issues with letting me know what I have in my que to watch. They use to go to the top when I had new episodes to watch now I have to sift through tons of shows to check if there is an episode to watch.
2019-06-04 16:03:11,But the cheapest plan available,2,Peyter1324,False,The content really isn’t that bad but they advertise a plan that says no ads and that is completely false advertising. 85 to 90% of the shows we watch have ads at the beginning middle and end. When you call customer service and ask them about it they say there’s nothing they can do because the network is still paying for ads. When I asked them why they still advertise as no ads they have no good answer. Get the cheapest one because there’s no point in upgrading to no ads.
2018-10-20 13:15:24,Local channels tied to IP address,5,Joe@Spotswood,False,"Only complaint so far is that I cannot watch my NY based local channels (CBS, NBC, ABC) due to my ip address being based closer to Philadelphia.  I have tried to resolve this with information provided by your tech support with no success thus far.

Would be nice, if possible, to have a setting that would allow me to choose which region’s broadcast of these channels that I would prefer to watch."
2018-05-16 01:43:42,Awesome!,5,Kingxkalei,False,"The new update is AMAZING. FINALLY we can watch our shows without accidentally touching the screen & fast forwarding or rewinding the show. I’ve been waiting FOREVER for them to fix that so we can watch our shows perfectly fine & now we can. Good job guys, now i can watch my shows without doing anything accidentally cause now we have to press & hold the screen. 5 stars for me"
2018-10-08 12:14:37,Irritating and inferior,1,Thephoenixlights,False,"Tells me I can’t fast forward through commercials though I pay for the commercial free version. I’m trying to skip the opening sequence and get on with the show. I shouldn’t be prevented from doing this. There’s also no option for skipping the intro automatically.

Please also get rid of these clips before shows which give us behind the scenes footage of the show we’re about to watch. I don’t want to see this every time I start an episode. I don’t want to be take out of the story and be reminded that these are actors. That’s why behind the scenes footage is optional everywhere else!

Come on."
2018-07-05 20:35:17,Difficult ff and rr,2,me_123,False,"Full screen ff and rr is unnecessary and difficult. When I try to drag up my control center or drag down my notifications it always ff or rr the show, which is always inconvenient.
The is no stop in place for rr after ads. If I miss a tiny chunk just after ads I have to careful to not get to close to the ad break or I’ll have to sit through the ads again. There should be a stop in place that if I click the 10 sec back loop it’ll take me to the start of the show after the ads without making me sit through the ads again."
2018-06-04 13:17:19,TERRIBLE app,1,Labpopstar,False,"The service itself is good enough, but each update makes the app less user-friendly and overall worse. The app has recently started giving fits like ""too many videos playing"" (even after I ensure the app has been stopped and completely closed out on all our other devices) and ""connection error"" (even if other apps on my device are having no problem). The worst is when the app toggles between these two problems in a seemingly never-ending loop. I'm starting to think that only getting to use the service part of the time somehow isn't worth paying full price."
2019-10-05 09:53:49,Annoying,5,Revillagagado,False,What is going on? It still shows all of the new shows at the top of my list and shows that they are unwatched. I have watched them I want them to go to the bottom of the list. Why is it still showing all of these new shows at the top of the list as being unwatched???  This is really annoying and needs to be fixed.
2020-06-30 18:50:07,Nice app but some things need to improve,3,#1 my hero acadamia fan,False,First I would like to say for my hero academia why do you put it in Japanese I think it would be better for season four so I can watch it and I think that instead of getting so much adds why not lower it down and make the no adds a bit more cheaper that’s all but the thing I want the most is for you guys to put in the English version of my hero academia if you do I might put in a 5 star rating I hope you do this and that’s all I’m asking for.
2020-06-10 21:08:15,"I love it, but...",4,RyanDelorenzo,False,For the past few months every commercial break the show will play 3-5 seconds of the show without audio then go to the commercial and then after the commercial break it will play the show but won’t show the 3-5 seconds it played without audio. Then if you try to rewind it to see what was said it just goes back to the commercial. I hope that makes sense. Other than that I love the app.
2020-04-19 04:16:50,ADS ADS ADS ADS ADS ADS!,4,BobGunJoe,False,"I love this site to death, but why do we need to pay for this and have an 80 second ad play every five seconds? Please, only put them at the beginning of the thing your watching and at the end, but NOT in the middle. Also, I’m constantly getting the same stupid, irrelevant and consistently annoying group of ads over and over again. Please, give us less ads during the Coronavirus pandemic."
2019-10-29 16:57:11,FIX YOUR APP!,1,Please Correct This,False,"Two months now and the same issue. I renew my subscription through iTunes, they CHARGE ME but then it keeps saying I’m not subscribed on the app. Then I try refreshing the app, still doesn’t work. So I log out of the app and try to log back in and it tells me I’ve already purchased the subscription and I can’t move forward. I’ve tried using the “restore purchase” and it’s the same issue, my only solution is to purchase a higher subscription. That’s BS, and I got a feeling you guys glitch it on purpose! I would like a refund for the two months where I was FORCED to upgrade to just log back in."
2018-06-27 21:02:30,Updated,5,Robyn finley,False,This new update watching a movie/tv show from your phone is inconvenient. Now instead of pressing full screen and it remains it does not anymore! You can be watching something in full screen and suddenly you move your phone or it tilts just a smidge and it’s right back in the tiny screen again. Can we leave well enough alone please
2019-06-01 03:56:37,"Easy and reliable, a few issues",4,JustMeWritingAReview,False,"I enjoyed the app watching all my favorite tv and shows, but whenever a big moment happens, an ad plays, and sometimes I want to rewatch it, but I end up having to watch the whole ads all over again, and it a won’t go away. I think it would be convenient that after you watched the ads that it would disappear, but it’s mainly the only problem"
2019-01-07 01:53:39,Glad I tried it free first,1,Manymopars,False,"This app is terrible. It is the 5th day out of the free week and it has been nothing but trouble. All but one movie I watched couldn’t play straight through. I had to close the app several times and restart the app and resume watching. Sometimes it would start where it stopped, but not always. The rewind/fast forward thing is a total mess. And no matter how many times I select a show/movie to be removed from my recommendations, the next day it is right back there. How many times can I say that I don’t want to watch freakin Twilight. Definitely won’t be paying for this app."
2018-07-28 14:37:34,Yo many ads and super long,2,Cubanking6,False,"I like the shows and stuff but man, is so many ads I’m watching this show and it has 5 ads and they all were over a 100 seconds expect for 1 that was 45 seconds. I basically spend 8 minutes out of 30 minute show watching ads. You guys have to change that we paying for a reason. Be more like Netflix. Or DTV now that only shows ads if you watching live tv. Other thing is that you guys show sometimes the last seasons but not the starting ones so I’ve to start a show from season 5? really?"
2018-05-24 03:56:56,Chromecast,4,Ehhhh5603,False,I almost solely use the app to cast shows. In the most recent update the chromecast portion was changed and now there doesn’t seem to be a way to change the volume so instead I have to switch to my google home app. My app will also crash with no warning and I close and restart it and it crashes again. Even after the newest update. The only way that I’ve found to fix it is to restart my phone.
2017-11-03 00:23:50,Picture in a picture,5,Mrsmute,False,I don't have any other problems with your new format but pLease bring picture in a picture back.  I like to multi task while watching my shows.  So a new update and still no pip.  Why not????  Another update and no PIP!!!!!!!!!!!  Please bring back picture in a picture!!!!!  Thank you... thank you... thank you.  You brought picture in a picture back.......
2017-11-28 07:56:34,Fix your freaking app. Jesus.,2,Oshboshbagosh,False,"I hate being that guy, but your app is too unique. There’s nothing wrong with at least being parallel with the bell curve off these show apps. By the way, you keep giving and taking away the ability to background play the videos. I used to be able to lock my phone, while the video plays audio only, as I sleep. Like having a TV on, except without any light in the room. It helps me sleep, and keeps my restless mind occupied, to help me sleep. So please, fix this. I’m not the only costumer bothered by this issue. Please, and thank you."
2017-09-21 02:51:14,TERRIBLE!!!,4,Sazu72,False,"I am all in to updates but this is a big step BACK!!! Before I was able to know right of the bat what I had in my watch list but now I can't know how many shows I have left until I go all the way into each one of them, and when ur all caught up it takes you all the way back to the first episode. All the tabs and headers are so small,,, plain and simple what ain't broke don't fix it.... they should have left it as it was."
2020-08-30 22:05:22,Way to many commercials,1,rhxjwr sosbd,False,"So I try to post a picture of how many seconds are in every commercial break and him many there are during a movie so you would believe me but it won’t let me. 11 plus commercial breaks and everyone of them are around 290 seconds each. I paid for no commercial thinking it would be better and hardly any shows have no commercial breaks.  It’s not worth it in my opinion, almost 5 minutes of commercial each time. Oh and you cannot fast forward though any of them, even if you pay for no commercial. I’ll be going back to regular cable."
2020-04-12 04:25:24,Some good most bad,2,ljgdpugduofdpugdgupdupg,False,There are way to many ads if I wanted to watch ads I would just watch cable and there are not many episodes of some shows which is annoying because if I wanted to just watch some episodes I would just watch cable so this is so annoying if I have to pay for no ads then I can just go to Netflix and Disney plus but they don’t have the shows I was watching my favorite show and an ad came on the the theme song right after the song another ad came on which was very annoying
2020-04-08 23:32:26,Unfortunately the only choice,2,CubeNQuirk,False,"This app has absolutely horrendous user interface. No one wants to see a full screen art depiction of the series with only a play option readily available. We want options, lists, easily discernible choices and multiple titles under categories. 

The keep watching tab is entirely hidden. The titles you are currently watching only allow yuh to play the “next episode”, two screen strokes are required to see the season and episode lists. 

Pros: it works once you figure out how to navigate it’s clunky UI"
2020-03-10 04:28:30,"Fine service, garbage app",2,maryannlabonne,False,"I’ve used this app on multiple iOS devices and on multiple WiFi sources, and it’s always riddled with an absurd amount of glitches. 

Roughly once every four times I try to click on something, the app fails to load and I have to close out of it and restart to get it working again.

There’s no “next episode” button in full screen, which is infuriating, since it means I have to go back to the main menu, scroll back down to the show I’m watching, and find the next episode every time."
2020-02-13 00:51:23,Love it but..,4,joshieee1076,False,"No doubt I love the app, but there are issues with certain anime shows, such as, Naruto Shippuden where the english episode isn’t there on episode 141 ‘Truth’ and so on with the other episodes. If there is anything wrong with this situation please fix it. The show isn’t the same when listening to it in Japanese. Also check the show Boruto: Next Generations because i’m not sure if they have the english episodes or not. Thank you."
2019-11-05 10:10:07,Playback errors screen freezes 🤯🤬🤬🤬,2,Nadizze,False,Lately on TV I can’t get through 10 minutes of any program without the screen freezing or a playback error message.  It’s incredibly frustrating and there are new updates like every other day.  Don’t get me wrong I appreciate that now I can see a TV guide schedule on the screen but if I can’t get through a 30 minute program without glitches and freezes and playback errors I could care less what comes on next.  Just saying.  If this doesn’t improve soon I’m out.
2019-11-01 07:27:20,Not sure if it’s my phone company/plan or the app??,3,Calliforniamariah,False,I only get to watch movies about maybe 1 week out of a whole month because the app won’t load movies. I know it’s “not connected to the internet” but I don’t understand why the internet & data from your phone isn’t good enough? But then again I’m not tech savvy. Other than that it’s a great price & I don’t mind the commercial breaks (if you fit enough movies/shows into the money it’s worth the money despite the commercials). Thanks!
2019-10-08 02:28:38,What’s going on?,3,Sra. Gonzalez,False,"With this new update, things are going haywire! The app doesn’t seem to acknowledge that I’ve already watched an episode. It keeps saying that there are unpatched episodes that I’ve already viewed. And there are shows that I don’t have on my list, that continue to show up in My Stuff. I don’t know how to get rid of them. And what is the logic behind the algorithm that determines which show comes up next in my queue? It would be nice if it was something in My Stuff at least!"
2019-10-03 03:29:30,Complete garbage,1,Ign~ seeker77584,False,"I wish I hadn’t paid your company a dime. Your service is terrible, I pay to be able to watch the shows you provide, yet I get looped around, 40second ad followed by 90 second ads, followed my your garbage app not buffering the episode back up yet continuing to run the episode progression timer. Your settings are trash, why put an account tab in the app if I have to go to the website? You’re not providing the services I paid for and I want my 6$ back. Why pay for ads when I can pirate for free. And at least my pirates will buffer. 0/100 trash app, shame your even considered a rival to Netflix."
2019-06-09 18:00:40,Swipe down feature,1,nancnanc_,False,"I hate the swipe down feature. There have been too many times that I accidentally close the video I’m watching because I tapped the screen to check the time. If I want to close the video I’ll tap the X in the corner. In my opinion the swipe down to close is not necessary, there should at least be an option to disable it. I don’t know if anyone else has this problem but I’m constantly getting error messages about the playback, but I know my WiFi is working correctly because if I open another streaming app there’s no issue so I don’t understand."
2019-04-13 05:14:26,Great but....,3,adamPOW917,False,"I really love this streaming app! I use it all the time; more than I watch Netflix. But a few months ago this thing started happening. It would take a long time to load the tv shows I watch and/or wouldn’t even load at all. I would wait then it would say “error playing this video”. It will work sometimes after 5-6 tries of watching or it would work if I came back at a different time. Overall I love this app, it’s great, but it really needs improvements"
2018-12-13 05:12:28,Can’t rewind or fast forward,2,Beccangel,False,"Since the new update, I’m unable to rewind or fast forward any shows. It says unable to during commercials. I don’t have commercials. This is something that needs to be fixed immediately, it’s very frustrating. Also, what happened to the ability to turn the volume up/down? That used to be an option before you switched to the new platform. I have to exit out of the app and open up Google Home to adjust the volume now. Netflix still has volume controls in the app."
2018-07-26 19:00:50,So many issues,2,Maileykaye,False,"Half the time it won’t even let me log in to my account. It says there’s an issue with the connection or something. I try logging in to my account in the browser, it works.. so it’s just the app that’s the problem. Then, when I’m watching an episode of something, it will either keep playing the sound, but the picture will freeze or the sound turns off but the picture keeps going. In order to fix this, I have to quit out of the app all together and restart it. This is ridiculous."
2018-04-07 12:41:58,Can’t see video but can hear audio,1,Naruto lover 124774,False,"I fail to understand how since you made the update changing the entire operating system this app has gotten worse and worse? Was it on purpose? who is in charge of these decisions a monkey? 
“In order to compete with Netflix, we are going to make our app even harder and more confusing to use with way more bugs!!”
“YUP SOUNDS LIKE A GREAT IDEA BOSS”
I have uninstalled and reinstalled. Logged out and back in, logged out then uninstalled then reinstalled and logged back in, reset iPhone multiple times. No matter what I can not see video when I watch a show or clip but I can hear the audio."
2018-01-30 23:13:17,Major glitches/Awful layout,1,Brdeat,False,"The layout of this app is horrible and not simple. And the fast forward rewind is glitchy and it takes forever to focus and not be glitchy. And I thought it was my internet connection or data, no my Netflix app works perfectly fine. And you can’t press play and listen to the show while your phone is locked, unlike Netflix where you can surf the web or other apps while listening. It just glitches up. And the layout of the app it’s self is awful makes you feel constricted and limited and I hate it. I miss the old set up. Hopefully they fix it."
2017-09-22 10:22:58,New version is terrible!,1,Tittleleigh,False,"I loved the old version so much better than this new update. When I am watching on my iPad and want to pause it, when I go to resume it, if I don't touch the play button right in the middle it will skip to where I touched. Why, why did you have to change something that worked great?? Also like someone else said, there is no picture in picture. You have to exit the app to do anything else. You'd think with the age of such a multitasking society they would have thought of this. I do like the flip tray, but that's about it. Nothing else about this new version is worth a crap!"
2020-08-28 05:22:21,Paying for this & there's WAY TOO MANY ADS!!!,1,Mappew85,False,"I pay for several video content apps so I don't have to watch commercials and ads, this apps is cheap but in a 15-20 minute episode of a show I watch, there are 5 ADVERTISEMENTS that I INTERRUPT EVERY FEW MINUTES!!! Doesn't that kind of defeat the purpose of paying for a tv or movie app?!... They are making a ton of money off us but still are greedy enough to bombard their paying customers with ads!... Seriously annoying and frustrating. I'd rather BUY each season of my favorite shows at $20 per season then to pay for this crap to be riddled with advertisements..."
2018-01-09 22:17:13,Can’t search episodes DON’T UPDATE,4,c00lcema,False,"DON’T UPDATE. By Reading other reviews and buy my problem, I am telling you there are really a lot of glitches with this new update. On mine I can’t go back to search episodes. It only let me resume the episode I’m on, but I want to watch a previous episode. I can’t find out how to go to back to view all episodes!! ALSO: they don’t let u see comments of what ur watching. I enjoyed reading the comments!"
2020-07-26 02:20:32,I’m not paying for extras,1,Brittanie Sidebottom,False,"I pay $12 a month for the ad free plan. Why can’t I access everything!? Certain things I want to watch have a padlock by them that says some crap about watching with live tv or an add on or I get a message saying I can’t watch because I “don’t have the right subscription”. I  googled it, and according to my research y’all expect me to pay up to $10-$12 more dollars to unlock them. Seriously!? I’m not paying $22-$24 a month for an app that obviously doesn’t work half the time anyway. Y’all are trippin if you think people are that dumb. Fix it and I’ll fix my review!!"
2020-06-11 02:44:49,Glitches,3,samaribell,False,"The app has been messing up for a couple weeks now. It will randomly exit the app and then when I go to watch a show it shows more ads. The ads play fine, then when the show comes on, it glitches are takes a long time to load. I have reset my iPad, reset my router, and tested other apps. This is the only one I’m having trouble with. Please fix the issues, because I’m ready to cancel my subscription. Not worth watching just ads."
2020-05-31 03:43:13,Horrible. Hope you didn’t want a easy deactivation.,1,BigolC,False,"They make it WAY too hard to cancel your membership. Can’t cancel it through the app, they make you go to the website on a computer to do it, it’s 2020, that’s ridiculous.i can’t even log in through the app to watch my shows cause an error message pops up. It’s been this way forever. I’ve been trying to cancel mine for awhile now but every single time I go to their website to my account page an error message shows up and I can’t get to the page to deactivate my account. So I guess I’m going to have to call them."
2020-05-30 03:40:56,Install It Every Day and Enjoy!,3,ann859,False,"It has great content and the live channel selection is well-priced vs. my comcast cable, which despite me paying $200 per month wouldn’t give me local channels on the app. The problem- live tv fails to work on my device at least once per day and the only way to fix it is delete and reinstall. Delete and reinstall. Delete and reinstall. Oh, and the other thing is really awful commercials. Maybe they will fix these things some day."
2020-01-20 16:30:22,If I see one more ad.,3,Gacha Crazy,False,"So, good app, i give you that. I can’t watch CSI Miami, with all these flipping ads! One suggestion is if you already watched the ad and want to go back, you shouldn’t have to watch the ad again. Second one is, make something FREE so we have the chance to NOT have ads or TO have ads. These ads are killing me! 90 to 80 SECONDS, I could do like 30 laps while this thing is on. Really expected NOT SO MANY ADS!! 3 one, TAKE AWAY THE ADS. { Sorry if it came out harsh, I’m just frustrated with the ads}

2019-09-10 07:51:22,Liked this app at first,1,Apple is incompetent,False,Like the design and the layout. Works pretty well but there’s one thing. If you accidentally swipe to far it’ll close the player and if you open it right back up you have a 50/50 chance of it remembering you even watched it so it will start over but regardless it will play the rating clip and the provider clip every time no matter what. Really makes me mad every time it does it. I don’t mind it if I just started the episode/movie but if I close it for a millisecond then just let me keep watching and for the love of god remember where I stopped watching. It’s really bad at that.
2019-07-30 23:14:03,Worst user interface and user experience for live TV,1,WindowsStillOwnz,False,"App is extremely frustrating to use. It’s really terrible on Samsung TVs and Apple TV; ok the iPad. It has two menus at the same time in two layers, impossible to navigate to where you need to be. Arranging your favorite channels the way you want is impossible. You have to leave the channel to go back to the menu or see what’s on other channels. App does not remember what you watched last. The Live TV is hard to navigate, the icons are tiny, I have no idea what channel I’m on, no preview. App is unnecessarily complex and exhausting with 100 different menus and unnecessary recommendations."
2019-06-04 01:09:39,Not quite worth the money,2,Jcasey74,False,"Seriously disappointed, it went from being a great app to watch shows on and now it’s more commercials than anything unless you pay double for the no commercial option, which doesn’t even include every show they offer as a commercial free option. On top of that it’s the SAME commercials every single time. One 28 minute episode comes with about 5 minutes of commercials! It’s ridiculous and extremely frustrating and honestly not even worth watching anymore."
2018-10-22 10:36:40,Please Fix,3,dphievip,False,"Shows in my queue aren’t recognizing that they have been watched. When the show is opened, it will display ‘watched’ in every episode, but in the My Stuff menu the show will appear at the top with ‘32 unwatched.’
In addition, a show can be fully watched, but unless it is watched until the counter says 0:00 (which is nearly impossible because auto-play will start the next show), it will remain at the top of the My Stuff menu with the ‘Resume Episode’ action."
2018-10-01 01:17:38,Can’t sign up,1,iriyu5,False,"The app asked for information, I typed it in; however, it kept saying that the app has an error and I should try again later. So I did exactly what it asked, and tried again only to find out it still has an error and I should try again LATER. I submitted credit card information, email, and everything else this app needed, yet, why is it that I can never create my account on here? Doesn’t make sense that I can’t create an account here via the app (what is the point of even making an app if people can’t create their accounts on it?). Completely disappointed."
2018-03-27 20:35:42,Different devices have different issues,3,Seriouslyirritated,False,"I have issues with pausing shows on my iPad and iPhone. Most of the time I will try and pause and it will skip to a random part of the show. On my appletv the subtitles don’t stay on. I have to go in and turn them back on every. Single. Episode. This doesn’t happen with my iPad or my iPhone at all. I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling the application but nothing has fixed it so far. Other than that, it works fine."
2018-02-10 00:59:48,"Glitch, Bug, Too many commercials",1,Nuts4forestville,False,"So I’m not here to complain about the commercials. I understand that they are necessary. I’m complaining about the 314 second commercials that I have to sit through only to be disappointed because the video paused won’t play ,and then puts me BACK to the beginning part of the tv show before the commercial began. Not only does it start that portion over, it turns it into a commercial so that I can’t fast forward. Now that is one cruel bug. This is so frustrating. I’ve been trying to watch a 1hour tv show for 2.5 hours! I just want to watch the end of The Librarians."
2018-01-31 02:38:44,No mirroring and too many ads,1,ZachG4,False,"The app doesn’t allow mirroring or airplay support. Every other streaming app lets you do this! Also, I don’t mind ads but they have too many ads and in the most horrible spots when watching episodes. Ad starts then you get to opening credits, then another ad right after. If you accidentally click out of a show your watching and go back and click resume be ready for....you guessed it, more ads! When an ad plays it’s usually 4 ads in a row and they buffer. How about just 1 ad when it plays. Fix these things then it would be 4 or 5 stars."
2018-01-28 19:34:55,Terrible update,1,bruinsfan1409,False,All the problems started happening a few weeks ago. The audio on the video will just shut off and you will have to restart the app just to get it working again. It will also just randomly fast forward through the episode for no reason and with the new way to go back and forward in the show or movie it's almost impossible for you to get back to where you were after this happens. Another issue is the captions almost never work. I'm very close to deleting this app and just using Netflix because it is so frustrating to use.
2018-01-25 02:46:35,Canceling,1,Melexie,False,"I’ve had this app for a while and really enjoyed it until recently when they updated it. The fast forward without seeing where in the video is extremely annoying and if you touch the screen it moves your place in the video. I can deal with those issues but now the app isn’t letting me log in and it’s been a little over 3 days. I’ve tried all the tricks restarting my phone, deleting and reinstalling the app etc..I am disappointed with it and I’m just going to cancel my membership and delete because at this point it’s not worth being frustrated with."
2020-09-14 22:49:57,Naruto,3,RIKR0LL,False,"Ok for al my peeps who watch Naruto English dubbed, u would understand why I’m righting this review I hate that the English dub doesn’t go all the way to season nine and instead stops half way thru season 3 it’s dumb don’t get me wrong I think that it’s a great app but why put English dub at the beginning and not finish all the way thru doesn’t make sense I hope they fix this and if there is a way to watch Naruto English dub that doesn’t give you a virus or calls for a proscription then please tell me I would really enjoy!"
2019-12-20 02:05:40,Censor your commercials,2,The boot1,False,"It’s really frustrating that when I am watching a cooking show with my five-year-old son I have to make him look away during commercials because there is a very provocative lingerie commercial that pops up and I do not want my five-year-old son to watch. can we please keep that for the adult channels like hbo starz and fx?  5 minute commercials is RIDICULOUS. Almost 3 hours to watch an hour and a half movie. $55 a both yo basically watch commercials. I am DOWNGRADING as soon as college football bowl games are over
 Also stop raising the prices!"
2020-06-29 13:22:24,Unsatisfied Customer,1,Wonteventakemycall,False,I’ve been on phone with Shantell for over 40 min in which the last 25 min I have asked for a supervisor still I’m holding she doesn’t keep in touch with me dead air is forEVER as she has NO CUSTOMER SERVICE ETIQUETTE!!! I am LIVID that she won’t transfer me and I have had this service for over 2 years I want answers and I shouldn’t be left just sitting on my phone with dead air as she keeps saying she’s emailing for help and they won’t allow her to transfer me till they say so WHO DOES THIS??? I pay $$$ for this service and EXPECT to get what I pay for without logging in EVERYTIME I want to watch my service this is RIDICULOUS
2020-04-17 01:38:35,No stars,1,lovershighlow,False,"The app on the tv keeps crashing. I thought maybe it was my internet connection, but other friends n family members r having the same issue. N the app for iPad n phones is bad too, even though it gives u the option to have continuous play, it will go to the next episode but stop at the season cover pic n u have manually press play, doesn’t sound like continuous play to me. N now the app crashed on my ipad, its not playing anything. Wat a joke, that’s y ppl use illegal sites to stream because when u try n do it the right way, u get played out of ur money. Won’t be renewing my subscription."
2019-07-22 06:26:20,Ads,5,K0mander85s,False,"The ads get annoying it’s like watching tv and commercials keep popping up during tv shows, I like to watch this series and when I play an episode there is an ad and most of the times it 90 seconds worth of ads🙄 and then after the intro of the show there is another 90 seconds and then in the middles more 90 seconds🙄"
2019-11-09 13:50:59,Great original shows keep me signed up and that’s it,1,MissMaryzrblue,False,Worst streaming app ever.  Controlling items in “my list” is a mess.  Constantly resetting itself and saying I have dozens of episodes to watch when I am completely caught up. Then items in my list won’t delete.  Also when first opening up for the day the live tv menu won’t load until the app is closed out and completely reset.  I have even had to delete and reload.  And commercial free option I pay for?  Can’t figure that out as all there are are constant repeating commercials.  Disappointed in what used to be a good app.
2019-10-22 13:58:20,Dislike,1,zzzxxxxxz3456,False,"The app randomly closes out during the middle of shows, and the ‘previously watched or continue watching’  and ‘up next’ are always doing something weird. I have a hard time finding my shows. It also NEVER remembers where I left off during a show and always takes me back to an earlier part of the episode (not a few seconds, like 10-20 minutes off of my previous ending spot), then of course it makes me endure ads to fast-forward back to the part of the show I was previously watching. I really hate this app. Very frustrating to use."
2018-09-14 16:10:28,My Stuff,5,pollita2510,False,"Not sure if anyone else has reported this but when trying to remove shows from “My Stuff”, you go through all the steps but it still appears in your My Stuff area. 
Usually after I finish watching a series, I like to remove it from my stuff and keep what I’m currently watching. It would be nice if this bug could be fixed."
2019-07-03 18:42:10,I can’t Log In,3,Miho Davis,False,I already have a subscription but I can’t log in. Every time I try it tells me to upgrade my subscription to no ads and I really don’t wanna buy it. It tells me to go to restore purchases and when I do that it just tells me to renew subscription which just tells me to buy another plan and when ever I do that it tells me I already have a plan active. I don’t see anywhere that I can report this at so I’m just putting this here and I hope y’all can see it.
2019-05-21 11:24:57,Unstable app,1,Adrienne1234456789,False,"This app is extremely unstable. I have to constantly restart my iPhone if I end an episode halfway through and want to restart it later. No matter what I try, the episode just won’t resume, and other episodes won’t start. Sometimes that doesn’t even work and I have to uninstall and reinstall the entire app. I have a new iPhone so it’s not a hardware issue! Other streaming apps are working great!  
Definitely do the free first month so if you have this problem, you don’t end up paying for an app you can’t use. I certainly will be cancelling. Too bad because the shows seem good!"
2018-11-19 19:54:52,No decent tech support,1,Dr Papa,False,"When a new buggy version comes out, you will waste your time with hapless tech support people who state they can’t here you regardless of the phone line you use and then hang up on you. Online support will tell you to use airplane mode even if you warn them you are on the device that is having issues. Or they will claim you have low bandwidth even though you are connecting via safari through twitter and independent apps show you have sufficient bandwidth. Never dealt with a worse set of tech support staff. Service is fine when it works. Have Netflix as a backup."
2018-10-18 22:38:08,The worst....,1,Sucker again32,False,"Started about 4 days ago, and am extremely disappointed. First off, I was shocked that I would have to watch 2-3 minutes of ads just to watch 5-7 minutes and then watch some more ads. Seems way too much.  Also on the forth day, it wouldn’t even let me watch the series I’m on. Keep saying try something different or come back later to watch. Really!!! Lastly there layout for the app and website aren’t the greatest. Not easy to navigate or find specific things that you want. Don’t waste your time. Cancelling my subscription as soon as I’m done with this."
2018-09-29 03:27:15,Not recognizing & to many ads,1,911Beast,False,"First, for some reason when I’m home it will not recognize my device, it will log me in then tell me sorry something is wrong with internet connection. I check my WiFi, turn the phone off, even re downloaded the app, still will not let me access it. Now it’s saying “nothing here to see”. I pay for this because some of these shows are not on Netflix, If the problems continue I’ll just unsubscribe. 2nd: To many ADs. I have memorized the ads that continue to play over and over. It’s ridiculous!! Not worth the money I’m paying for sure."
2017-11-22 04:09:23,Awesome...better than cable,5,Malbionic,False,"Love the new design!  

It’s as good as Netflix for function except you can’t search by actor.  Love the set up, could be better, but really, I like it!  So much better than cable and no commercials!

Wish they had MASH, all seasons of Charles in Charge, Family Ties, and Facts of Life.  Can’t fault the actual app for that there is some sort of legal thing.  If you email them, they respond!"
2018-04-30 14:24:11,"Very nice app, but shrinks video down on iPhone X",3,Using iPhone 6,False,"App works very well and I’m loving the content, but the viewing experience on an iPhone X is pretty bad. The app itself is updated for the iPhone X and fills the entire screen, but for some reason, the videos shrink down to smaller than my iPhone 6 screen! There is black screen on all 4 sides of the video. The left and right black screen is bigger than ½” on both sides! Will gladly update to 5 Stars when fixed. Btw, the fast forward and rewind isn’t that bad."
2018-02-03 20:54:36,Worst app available,2,Dfygdgxf,False,"Non user friendly, always losing my settings, new episodes are available but does not show up in my “my stuff” with the new episodes. Sometimes it will not play when I have to search the show, to watch the new episode (its not the coming soon, or whatever its called). Last night we could not watch any of our shows, it kept saying we were out of our area, or region. I was at the same darn place I always am! Absolutely terrible update, bring back the old app,  it was simple and brilliant!"
2017-10-08 16:47:57,Unable to connect to Chromecast to TV from my phone now,5,DeborahDuncan,False,"I liked the old version better.
I could push the connect icon and it would turn the tv on and all I had to do was select what I wanted to watch.  I can’t do that now!!!  I will not update my iPad because of this!  You all need to put that back!!  Really not happy about that at all.  This last update was NOT FOR THE BETTER!!"
2020-03-14 20:11:03,I have some complaints,4,Italianchica78,False,When I’m watching a show it sometimes starts at the end of the episodes. Like when I’m watching a cartoon I only watched two episodes and when I go on to the next episodes it play the end of the it. Also when I have captions on it likes to keep the same caption there for the rest of the episode. Those were my complaints I hope these glitches stop soon.
2020-09-18 20:28:28,Downloads,3,fuqayou,False,"I’m honestly disappointed only because I downloaded this app specifically to download stuff and be able to watch it when I’m not online. But the issue is that nothing downloads without having to sit in the app and wait for it to download. Multiple times I’ve started downloads and then left the app because I had other things to do and then came back to check, and there was zero progress. Quite disappointing."
2020-05-15 02:12:26,Same problem for multiple people,3,Fan of Voltaire,False,"So I’m with a group deployed, and all of us have the same problem.  When we try to watch a show, after one episode finishes, the next one refuses to play. It takes so many tries to get to play one video that we get frustrated and find somewhere else to watch shows and movies. 

When it does work it can be frustrating that there’s no intro and end credit auto skip. But mainly it’s the first problem."
2020-04-20 15:59:12,Good but there’s an annoying problem,3,Wh1teBr3ad,False,"Has a great selection of shows and a good system but is horrible in letting you know what is new. I am a big fan of anime and I had no idea that new anime was being aired, and I had no way of knowing what was even available. The new design makes it hard to watch shows I enjoy and impossible to start shows I might enjoy. There are also a variety of annoying bugs and glitches. Great app but horrible design and bad changes."
2019-07-18 07:48:49,Commercials are terrible,3,Lilac_43,False,"Shows are good, format is terrible. There used to be just commercials at the beginning, now they’re throughout, feels like watching regular tv, only more annoying, because it’s the same commercials that run each time!  

The FF & RW features need work, too. When manually moving the bar, I can’t tell where I am at in the show without stopping and waiting for it to load. I’ll cancel again after I’ve watched the couple shows I like."
2019-07-28 02:21:49,The functionality of the iPad app has issues.,2,JD2205,False,Swiping down while watching a video should not be a gesture to go back. I often find myself swiping away a smudge on the screen and accidentally taking myself out of the video and then re-entering it makes me watch advertisements again after watching a commercial break. Using Bluetooth also causes the app to crash if the Bluetooth device disconnects for any moment of time. I've often needed to restart my device in order to resume viewing.
2019-06-07 03:32:17,Commercials commercials commercials,1,P.AS F.,False,"When I first got a subscription. My commercial time was at most 160 minutes and not as often. Now all of a sudden they range quite often at 300+ minutes. It seems that they are trying to get you to pay more to get rid of all the commercials. Very frustrating. It almost makes you want to go back to dare I say cable or satellite TV. At least on there it was easier to set them up to record and watch later. That way you can fast forward through commercials.
I know you’re able to do that on here. But it is a pain"
2019-01-17 07:00:27,Easy to use app,5,Hulufan8564,False,"Easy to access show I’d been watching without having search up where I last left off. Just open the app, conect to the correct display, press “keep watching” and enjoy! Could pause or fast forward using the app while still using your phone. Many different cool attributes like favorite list, popular list etc..."
2019-05-21 03:44:23,Why am I even paying for this??,1,Unhappy fam,False,There are so many glitches it almost makes it not worth it to pay for a subscription. I’ve gone days without being able to use this app because of a subtitle glitch or I just get a blank screen for forever before my video starts playing. No in-app help because I have to go online to the FAQ or anything which is extremely annoying and even then I get little to no answers for any malfunctions. Get it together honestly because if there are this many problems my money and other consumers money could be used elsewhere. -_-
2019-02-12 03:45:21,Waste of Money,1,BluenRedRoses,False,This app is absolutely abhorrent. The fast forward and rewind features are so poorly placed it interferes with other functions on the app. When using it on a IPAD it automatically places you into partial picture mode which in order to get out of you have to constantly tap on an ill placed icon to expand to full portrait mode. Content added to your watch list is not consistently updated and it will show in your list as never having watched any of the episodes at all. This has been been a chronic problem for at least a year that I am aware of. Netflix here I come
2018-10-26 19:02:34,So worth it,5,enizzle90,False,"This review is for anybody who is thinking about getting rid of cable, let me tell you it was definitely worth it I bought myself a smart TV and got the same sports channel junkie that I am all for 40 bucks a month. I get all the UFCMMA boxing basketball baseball ESPN fox fox TV fox news. I could watch it on my phone I can watch on my iPad I could watch on the TV. very happy with this purchase."
2018-11-03 15:33:21,Internet connection error,2,DanceLikeUmaThurman,False,"The app is so frustrating, there is a new issue every time that I try to use it. The last few times it has not let me watch anything because it says there is an error with my internet connection. I am always on WiFi and everything else that I use works just fine, and never has internet issues. It will not let me watch anything, and I have deleted and re-downloaded the app multiple times and even shut my phone all the way off and still nothing."
2018-06-23 21:46:14,About dragon ball super and dragon ball Kia,5,drebucket,False,I don’t  why I need live tv to watch dragon ball super and dragon ball Kia it makes no sense and it hurts me as a dragon ball fan. I love dragon ball z and it hurts me that I need live tv to watch  it. Not also with dragon ball super and dragon ball Kia but a lot of other shows. Please get rid of live tv and the app will be soooo much better. The fact that I need live tv to watch something pisses me off so much. Please get rid of live tv.
2018-10-30 03:39:50,Pretty good,5,UniyO101,False,"When I first got it the only thing I did not like was that you had to pay to watch shows on their but otherwise. It keeps track of what you watch and give you ideas of what other thing you may like. Also if you love anime they have tons. So if you like watching shows anywhere you can get this! 

Person out!"
2018-04-19 04:13:22,Why I live this app and why I don’t,4,Dolphin🐬 Queen 💍,False,"One of the reasons why I am in ❤️love with this app is because it has almost all of the Nickelodeon shows. When I heard about the update I thought there were going to be new episodes however there were not which really disappointed me and my sibling ☹️🙁😞😕💔💔💔💔💔💔. I really hope 🙏🙏🙏🙏 that you guys read this and add new episodes especially to The Thundermans, Jersey shoes, and all the others Bye 👋 love y’all!"
2017-09-20 03:21:14,Poor design choices in the rewrite,1,RBWest,False,"I cannot believe how poor the new interface is. Was this even tested outside of the designers? The layout is just painful to navigate and they put the same interface on the Roku app as well so I am screwed there, too.

* Why couldn't My List just carry over? Instead I have to fill out a survey where I thought I was training it on what I like but no, it put all of it in My Stuff (dumb name btw) so I had to remove everything I had already watched.

* In My Stuff all the episodes I ever watched for a moment but didn't finish show up at the top of the list. I now have to scroll down a long ways before I get to anything I haven't started yet.

* I don't like the side scroll between genres, the old style felt more natural (even if I might get used to the new UI eventually). I don't need ginormous thumbnails for everything, I would rather have smaller thumbs and fit three or four across."
2020-06-01 06:56:53,Constantly Restarts Episodes,2,Wrvip,False,The app constantly will restart an episode while you are watching it. The character will be saying something and all of a sudden the episode just begins from the beginning again. It doesn’t even save your progress in the episode so then you have to try and find where you were all while having to rewatch every single ad. The only reason this isn’t a 1 star review is because they have a picture in picture button and it works within the app.
2020-05-13 22:14:42,Rewinding,4,Lilmisspretty3899,False,"I shouldn’t have to rewind every episode every time I want to rewatch something. If I watched all of the episodes, it should automatically reset each episode so that I can start at the beginning when I want. If you want to be even better than that, I suggest adding a shuffle feature to your episodes so that way people could have options on how they want to watch their televisions."
2020-02-01 14:38:18,UI needs some work,2,sorrow567mrstealyogirl515,False,I like the app it’s got good variety but when want to log in on my laptop or my new smart tv I have to log into a computer and mage my account just to get the email it’s connected to I can’t even look at my email on the app it’s ridiculous. Why have the account tab in the app if it’s just tells you to go online I get that to manage the account you have to do that but why can you have the basic info there so we don’t have to get a laptop just to see what email the account is attached to
2020-01-10 12:36:11,Could be better.,3,Aidspring,False,I can’t even tell you how many times this app has skipped ahead in a tv series and ruined the surprise of the final moments of an episode or finale for me. It doesn’t seem to play at the previous spot that I watched an episode or it will skip to the next one I haven’t even started. It’s very frustrating. I also do not particularly like the fast forward/rewind feature by doing any area in the screen and dragging it. It’s touchy and usually happens by accident.
2019-12-31 16:24:34,Issue with the voice and shows staying in sync,3,Squirt_81,False,For the past week on almost every show that I watch I run into the same issue. Eventually there will be like a skip in the film that I am watching and then the voices come back delayed. I have stopped and started the shows back several times to fix the issue on a temporary basis but it ends up doing it again in no time. It’s really annoying. Is there a fix to this?
2019-04-19 13:12:39,Horrible interface,1,WallyZ123,False,"If you like tiny white fonts on a light tan background, this is the app for you! If you want to squint at tiny words with no ability to change font sizes or zoom you’ll love this gem! If you like clicking on menu items that don’t do anything, download this app! So many violations of really basic User Interface guidelines. Some features can’t be performed through the app, they refer you to the website instead. Could you perhaps provide a LINK to that webpage? No, just a vague reference please. If you designed this app for a class project, you would have failed."
2019-02-21 03:16:45,"Commercials, poor interface",3,MrPablo668,False,"You pay for the service, yet you still have to see the same commercials over and over. Plus, the interface is so “streamlined” that you don’t have easy access to either your own stuff or to the large options available if you only know how to search for them.  I gave it 3 stars because it’s still the best way to watch certain shows on the internet that are also still on air."
2019-02-05 19:55:08,Too Many Ads,1,Tiffany122514609,False,"Too many ads, I’m not gonna pay more for ad free. I should at least be able to watch 5 minutes without a 90 second ad. Every 5 minutes a 90 second ad makes a show that I wanted to see go from 55 minutes to 1h 10 minutes adding 15 minutes in ads. Actual math by the way and it’s ridiculous. I’m not saying the ads are the worst thing, it’s the frequency of them and how long they are. At least a 60 second ad every 5 minutes or even the 90 second ads every 10 or so. It could just be me but hey it’s unacceptable from a customer standpoint."
2018-12-13 07:23:18,Chromecast issue,3,Radwatsonator,False,"It won't let me fast forward/rewind while I have it connected to Chromecast, which is extremely annoying because it also doesn't have an option to skip intros or go to the next episode. It's also very buggy, and often it won't even allow me to fullscreen the video while watching it on my phone. Makes me close out of the app and restart it. Good content though, would just like to be able to watch it seamlessly."
2018-06-01 03:11:28,Better but still needs work,4,Kmeschino,False,"Really like the redesign. Having a real TVguide feels much more comfortable.
 But: 
- where is the volume button? 
- clicking “live”  when you’re already watching live tv stops what you’re watching ...to play what you’re already watching. It feels like it would be more intuitive if it just went to the live page/tv guide on the app if you’re already watching live tv."
2018-07-14 18:05:51,Need help,3,joy king was taken,False,Okay so I wasn’t having troubles with this app until a couple of days ago it worked fine nothing was wrong with it and then when I went to go and watch something it wouldn’t play the video. Everything else has been working but when I want to watch a video it just doesn’t start. The screen shows up with the play button and the forward and rewind button are there but when I press play the screen just stays black! PLEASE HELP ME UNDERSTAND!!
2017-11-19 16:43:59,Terrible,5,Schlafyhead,False,"Most of the time the show starts without sound, or sound with no picture.  During the first commercial break it just stops and shuts down.  I restart and have to watch the first act again.  Sometimes it will just continue to the end of the show, but more often than not, it shuts down again."
2018-11-22 03:48:57,Lineup is the worse,5,Karazhugh,False,I think you guys should go back to your old simple layout why do I constantly have to type search the shows I literally watch everyday! Shows that I always watch literally disappear from my watch next! Lineup feature is the worse non of those things are things I want to watch
2017-10-04 00:49:23,Wanted to like it-ended up hating it,1,distant wanderer,False,Save yourself the frustration of the live tv and stick with the cheap plans if you want the content (which is the only good thing about this app). You will spend way too much time trying to figure out where you are in the app than watching. If the developers had stuck with a format -grid- that people are used to this may have been the answer to cable. Instead its just a waste of time because of some geeks wild idea of being different. Maybe I'll come back when they fire them and realize what people want and redesign this stupid format.
2020-06-17 04:37:16,Mostly you don’t post for a little kids,4,JJ Mia ♡︎,False,I don’t like how you do not post for the kids because my little sister doesn’t like that she has been watching Steven universe and that’s her favorite show and it ended maybe you should put all the seasons because it’s not fair for little kids to have bad movies in bad shows I have seen what they have for a little kid you should put more things just saying
2019-12-11 14:14:51,Doesn’t save your place,1,Walrooose,False,Every time I come back to the app my movies and tv shows are not where I left them. I have to fast forward to find where I was. You can’t skip fast forwarding through the commercials when you get to one you still have to watch it. What’s the point of paying for commercial free if you still have to watch them while you are trying to find your place in your movie if you fast forward past those commercial breaks they stack. When you finally find where you were you have to watch 10 minutes of commercials
2019-11-27 02:09:35,Horrible,1,hekxige mxyegwb,False,"The only good thing about this app is maybe the selection, if that. If I’m already paying for a plan why should I have to upgrade just to remove ads. The ads make it impossible to watch shows because they are frequent 1.20 sec ads, which is absolutely ridiculous!! The overall setup of the apps is also horrible. I also don’t enjoy the whole situation where if u already watched an add but want to go back before that add you have to watch the ad again. I do not recommend this app.  Maybe become like Netflix and I’ll subscribe again."
2019-11-01 23:46:37,Ted talk,1,screw yo ballz,False,They review movies and tv shows faster than Netflix but you have to sit through 80 second ads. I pay money every month to watch it and every 15 minutes I have to watch commercials. I’d rather spend more money on Netflix and not have to watch commercials it’s bs. The app itself is hard to navigate. Keep in mind I’m not an 80 year old man who thinks floppy disks and cup holders are the same thing. I’m 16 and pretty tech savvy and I have a hard time navigating it. If you rewind you have to watch an 80 second ad again. It shouldn’t take me an 50 minutes to watch a 30 minute episode.
2019-07-26 22:21:07,"Great selection, but",3,Harper Tullin,False,"This app has an enormous range of shows and movies, but the app is riddled in technical problems. Every time I try to go on to the next episode of a show it had an error message that makes me restart the app. It's super annoying, also I have had some audio issues in the app, but those weren't permanent, sometimes the things I'm watching just freeze and I have to restart the app. I hope the developers fix these issues soon."
2018-09-01 00:47:02,Good app,5,MonoMZ,False,Good app. Some people may not like the new design and I think that there should be an option to toggle between the two. This app is great and most of the negative reviews I believe are from previous versions. It doesn’t crash at all in recent updates due to the fact that this app is updated frequently. Overall this app deserves 4.5 stars
2018-10-27 21:21:11,Just one complaint,4,erinococo,False,"Mostly good, it’s got a lot of movie and show options that Netflix doesn’t. My main complaint is how touchy it is; if you accidentally touch the screen the wrong way, it will skip back in the video, and when you try to return to the spot you were watching, it’ll make you sit through all the commercials you already passed through. Other than that, a good app!"
2018-09-29 02:46:36,Don’t do it,1,_Hef,False,"I downloaded the app and they charged me for the subscription right away but it won’t even load anything “it says we’re having trouble loading this right now” tried to cancel the subscription and it doesn’t expire till next month. I want a refund I’m not going to watch it for one month since it won’t even let me watch it when I barely downloaded it. Even deleted the app and re-downloaded, even restarted my iPhone and same error “we’re having trouble downloading your line up” it’s ridiculous get Netflix I also heard directv is having a sale."
2019-08-06 00:30:59,The best app but just two things,5,imessupeveryting,False,"First thing: can you please add a skip intro and recap button that would be really awesome if you can though.

Second thing: can you make the quality just a little better to make it more clearer because I watch anime and I watch it full screen and it’s a little blurry so that would be better thx. (yes I know I’m a weeb)"
2018-08-27 02:22:52,Terrible Navigation,2,Nessm20,False,Two stars only because it does actually play shows.  Finding the shows is terrible.  Recently watched or things on “my list” or whatever it’s called are no where to be found.  The shows that do show up in the list are out dated and I can’t get rid of them even though they are gone when I watch in our appletv.  I also don’t want a show to take up an entire page when I’m trying to browse.  Only being able to see one at a time really slows down the process.
2018-05-11 14:32:35,Chromecast Connection,2,lando213,False,"Establishing a connection to Chromecast is spotty. In order to connect you have to try repeatedly, sometimes three or four times. In other situations you have to delete the app and re-download from the App Store before it will work. This just started happening a few weeks ago. It is not related to the network connection as suggested in the FAQs because other apps that use Chromecast or able to connect fine. Having to re-download the app every time you want to see something is unacceptable."
2018-05-03 02:36:09,"End of episode ""next up"" options",3,ben1508,False,"Like the app, like the new feature for holding down slightly to rewind or fast forward. I have no more accidental jumps when I'm watching on my phone. I just wish the whole screen wasn't taken up by suggestions for what to watch next because it cuts off the ends of my episodes. I can't see what's going on because there is no way to minimize the platform. Helpful stuff, just needs to be able toggle on and off"
2020-07-31 00:34:58,Closing out on its own,4,ChainyMarie,False,I haven’t had any issues with the app until today when they updated it. I was watching my show and it closed out and took me to my home screen on my phone. I restarted the app and turned on my show and it happened again and again. I updated it and then it happened again. Idk if it’s the update or what. I’ll try deleting it and reinstalling.
2020-04-28 17:45:02,App won’t open,4,Th4t1n3rd,False,"UPDATE: I tried a few hours later and was able to open the app without it crashing. After signing in I got an email that I was using a new device even though I was using it on this device yesterday. 

After updating to the latest version the app won’t open anymore. I have tried deleting and reinstalling, rebooting my phone, but still no luck."
2020-03-24 15:17:04,Unwatched Episodes,4,Cait139826,False,"Since the update, all my shows in “my stuff” have changed to show that I haven’t watched them, when I have. For example, when looking at all my shows, SVU says 376 unwatched and Grey’s Anatomy says 17 unwatched, but when I open the shows themselves, they all show that I’ve watched the episodes. I’d like that fixed so I can actually know what shows have new episodes that are actually unwatched."
2019-12-23 17:57:46,Unable to delete show in Keep Watching,1,anyonecare52,False,"Very frustrating that I am unable to delete a series (The View) from my Keep Watching category.  There is no way to remove/delete this. I click on Remove....it reappears 5 minutes later. I don’t even watch this show!
 I’ve phoned customer support twice already...they see the problem...say they’ll refer out... but nothing has changed.

Yes, I’ve removed, then reinstalled the App...waited for a few days...but problem still persists.
   Very frustrating to pay monthly charges when you are having troubles with service."
2019-04-03 02:25:04,Older device? Expect frustration.,1,Zzzzzzzz090,False,"Usually get an ""error playing this video"" message when I try to watch anything. Sometimes it works, but usually it does not. And I'm paying something like $80/month, with the local channels and HBO/Showtime. Rebooted iPad (4th gen), reinstalled app from app store.. no change. Can play fine through the web, just not on the device anymore. No info on site about device compatibility that I could find, nothing addressing this issue. If it's no longer compatible, then fine, but if so then why is the broken app still available?"
2019-02-04 23:35:21,Amazing!,5,Juliah21599,False,I don’t tend to write reviews but I had to. The costumer service is amazing. They will help you and they don’t make things complicated or make you feel stupid for asking question. I really enjoyed the feature of messaging help and how quick it was. The shows are amazing and for only $5.99 a month with very few commercials it’s an amazing deal!
2018-09-29 03:36:30,Horrible,5,HisOnlyMrs,False,"Recently downloaded the app. Now, it continues to send a message saying check your internet connection. My internet connection is absolutely fine, I can’t watch any shows. I decided to restart my phone, and enemy a step further and uninstalled then reinstalled the app. Same problem. I can’t watch anything and I’m frustrated!"
2018-11-24 13:00:04,Too many steps,3,Johnnyv123456789,False,"I hate that when you choose to watch something it defaults to this random screen where your show is tiny in the corner and there’s all this extra biz they want you to look at instead? Then i gotta surgically touch the little expand button, AFTER I chose to view a thing. When I press play I expect the video to go full screen right away. Stop throwing up these obstacles to watching stuff. I dont care about that supplemental info!"
2017-10-08 18:55:30,Time travel,5,Ncczizzle,False,"It is far too easy with the new version of the app to accidentally jump to another part of the show (or whatever you are watching). Any swipe on the screen takes you to a different time stamp. Please make only certain parts of the screen, like the timeline bar, take you to different places I. The show."
2018-08-19 23:30:37,Crashes/locks up constantly,1,scevec,False,"It seems like the quality of the app is going downhill. I didn’t used to have all these crashes. Sometimes the episode will keep playing (I can hear the audio) but there is no video displayed or controls. All other functions stop working and I have to force close the app. Other times it just decides it’s done working for the day and won’t play anything. Again, have to force close it.

I’m watching your new show Casual but so far I’ve had to close and re-open the app four times and I’m only three episodes in!! Very frustrating."
2018-04-15 01:00:31,My videos started playing in a different language!,3,Bossmercedes,False,I was watching my shows all in English and for some reason everything started playing in a different language . I checked the settings and I closed and opened up my app and tried the same show and a different one and it doesn’t go back to English! I even turned off my device and did the same thing . I really liked this app before this started happening to my videos
2018-03-19 10:42:19,Fix the fast forward and rewind...,1,Schmukess,False,"This has been on your reviews for so long. I enjoy your service, but this aspect of your app is so aggravating. You’ve been receiving low star rating forever because of this, so I can only assume you are leaving it for the monetary value of me watching 80 seconds of ads simply so I can click back to the original place I never wanted to leave.  My guess is it’s due to the focused viewer that you get as a result of this idiotic interface, because I’m forced to sit and watch the ads somewhat actively so I can get the show back to the correct location."
2019-04-28 21:05:51,Pretty solid app,4,8-Tone Sparker,False,"It’s really well optimized, hasn’t crashed once. Everything is placed where you can see it, and it’s on top of it’s game when it comes to airing recently released shows. I’m currently binging GoT and my only complaint is that the prices are too high. Seriously, 27 bucks might not sound like a lot but it is. Which is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. If you can afford it, I’d get it in a heartbeat."
2020-05-13 03:38:36,Missing a lot of options found on other apps,3,RV-6A,False,"If you are watching a series when one episode ends the next one automatically starts. You should have the option of not making that happen.
Other apps can skip the opening credits for a tv series.
Other apps have previous and next episode buttons on the viewing screen (when you touch it).

It’s a very basic player and needs to catch up"
2020-04-16 00:35:45,Naruto,3,yeetmananana69,False,"On Naruto Shippuden, about 140 episodes in it changed from dub to sub which makes the show harder to enjoy. Also I got on to watch some Naruto and the subtitles have been very slow and doesn’t come fast enough to match when the characters start talking. Also your paying to watch shows but still get ads, one or two ads in a show are reasonable but there are 4-5 every episode I watch. Overall my experience hasn’t been too good."
2020-02-09 08:00:59,Everytime,2,Mr.Niddles,False,"It’s a decent app. Wonky at times but not that bad. Good alternative to Netflix sometimes. However, everytime I try and watch something I have to restart it at least 15 times to even work. It’ll always pop up telling me RUNUNKWN which is completely bs. I turn my vpn off, I make sure the app is updated, I restart my device and the app and it happens. Every. Single. Time. Plus I pay for no ads, but if I’m already paying for the service why should I pay extra for no ads. Just seems stupid."
2019-12-20 02:45:28,More ads than shows,1,Dai Perk,False,"Pathetic. I’ve spent a long time looking for the right word, and finally found it. This worthless, unreliable service literally does nothing but stop you from watching your shows by inundating you with endless, awful, obnoxious advertising. For every 30 seconds of content, you will be forced to sit through 90 seconds of ads. It’s like normal television, except much much worse, and btw you have to pay for it. Worst service, worst streaming, worst reliability, worst everything by a long song. everyone in charge of this nightmare should be fired."
2019-12-15 08:26:07,Decent selection...buggy app,2,aldjajfhakdja,False,"I’ve found that the app will do this thing where if I choose the option to watch the next episode without watching the credits the entire way through, it’ll start you back to the beginning of that episode at random. I’m on season 2 of a show and it just took me from the end of S2E4 to S1E6. It does this on all the shows I watch and it’s a VERY annoying bug especially because you get trapped into an ad with no way out before you can do anything."
2019-11-06 03:18:53,Randomly shuts off...,2,Bakedake87,False,"It was working fine but now it randomly shuts off after 5 to 60 seconds of watching. If turned on the side, it shuts down within 3 seconds. In love watching but can’t as I can get the app to stay open long enough to watch. Also restarts 3-5 minutes prior to where you left off, so it takes awhile to get back to your spot using the 30 second fast forward button. I really did like it previous to these issues. I have tried restarting and reinstalling..."
2019-08-30 11:30:48,Doesn’t even work,1,Pete Petowski,False,"iphone 8s plus, app won’t let me log in. I enter email and password and it simply asks if i would like to (re)subscribe - hitting no logs me out, hitting yes has me fill out my billing info pick a plan and then tells me i already have that plan and i should restore the purchase. I restore the purchase and it says “purchase restored, you will now finish creating your account”. I re enter all my info and it says you already have an account at this email address. So i try to log in and it asks if i would like to (re)subscribe. It’s a broken app and they wasted my time."
2019-08-13 21:13:41,TERRIBLE,1,Nsnsnssbsnsbs,False,"Im not one to bs about apps but this one deserves it. I paid for the no commercial package but yet some shows still have ads and they aren’t just 30 seconds long, they’re 90 seconds long and thats not all after only having the app for 3 days i tried to start up my show but i got an error, I went online to search for a solution but apparently the problem is on hulu’s end and I cant do nothing about but just wait until it gets resolved. I have never seen a company so big and popular be so uncoordinated, sloppy, misleading and unprofessional it just embarrassing"
2019-08-10 02:48:49,Confused,3,Young_writer_100,False,Okay so I usually love this app but my subscription ended and I let it go on hold on its own but I just put more money on my iTunes and updated my subscription for the $11 one and now it won’t work :( it keeps saying it had trouble changing me but I just put $15 on my card so I had $18 all together from the money left on my account before but it charged my account $11 and it still isn’t working. :( is there any way to fix this problem ?
2019-05-26 06:13:21,Auto play not working and other issues,3,MissCarla83,False,Auto play no longer works for most of my frequently watched shows on my iPad Pro. There’s also a show “stuck” in my Keep Watching list. I haven’t watched a single episode of the series in months and remove it daily with no success. My Keep Watching list also clears itself quite frequently (with exception of that one show) and adds random shows that I haven’t been viewing.
2019-05-21 14:25:17,The app needs an update because it does not want to play videos,3,Chasidyy,False,I’ve been trying to watch my shows for 2 days and it has not been working I literally tried everything turning my phone on and off deleting the app .. you name it I did it and it still does not work and the app is fully up to date ‼️ this really needs to change because I use this app everyday idk if y’all need to give another update but I need the app to work
2019-03-26 21:49:11,Overall good,4,Monster maker 2345:,False,"The app itself is very user friendly and is mostly everything you’d want. The problem is with the Live TV. It needs to be more customizable, I hate how it defaults to showing your recent channels in the guide. I just want it to go to all channels. Just add an option to choose what “guide” you want to default to, like sports, favorites, recent, all, etc.. Other than that the app works good and is generally nice."
2018-12-14 18:10:50,Controls are frozen when watching a video vertically,5,James6912,False,Ever since updating to iOS 12.1.1 the controls stop working when you have the phone vertical. It works at first but when you leave the app and come back to it the settings control and the button to play the video in landscape are frozen.
2019-01-18 18:48:16,Awful,1,annoyedashleyisannoyed,False,Tried logging in and starting a free trial just to watch the newest episode of greys anatomy and it wasn’t working on my laptop. Every time I clicked “start free trial” the website would crash and say error. So I downloaded the app on my phone and it said I started my free trial and my iTunes account would be charged in one month after the trial ends. Now I can’t log in at all. I really just want to cancel everything but I can’t log in at all to cancel it. Going to be pretty mad if my iTunes gets charged for something I can’t even use because the website/app doesn’t work.
2018-12-27 14:37:27,These ads gotta chill,3,Fuchsio,False,"I have a huge problem with the ads. I don’t mind them that much. However I do have a problem when I would be watching a show. Something in the show would happen before the ad, but whenever I would want to watch that certain part again. I’d rewind back to that part and the same ad/ads would appear again without an option for me to skip. I’d expect the ad to disappear after watching it."
2018-01-30 20:26:34,Hate hate hate,4,StephyB_Earthy,False,"The interface is such a waste of space and data, just go back to normal please. When I try to tap the ten second rewind it is constantly moving the playback allllllll the way back to where I’m technically tapping on the timeline! And then guess what I have to watch the freaking commercials I just watched. So frustrating. Please put the play, rewind and fast forward controls on their own bar!"
2018-11-04 19:52:08,"Ok, not great",2,ErikP310,False,"The services are fairly valued for channels for the money however the interface is poor, (there is no one place to see all channels and what is on them) and the live rewind/fast forward buttons are extremely difficult to use (can’t fast forward or rewind through commercials, making it almost impossible to either rewind to an important part to see again or to get up to near live if a commercial is in the way). These are 2 pretty big flaws and why I will be looking at competitors."
2018-09-29 14:28:20,Awful UX,1,Aliasmmm,False,"They must have had the interns design and develop this app. When I select a show to watch it gives me an unexpected error and it won’t load. It will not show all of my favorite shows or ones that I’ve been watching recently in the “My Stuff” section; it literally decided what to show me there at random, prioritizing shows that I haven’t watched in forever over shows that I am currently watching every day (logic!). It’s such terrible user experience that I really don’t understand what they are basing their expensive pricing on. This is definitely not premium service."
2018-05-11 01:11:50,Won’t save my place,1,Necedee,False,"The past few days I will be watching a show and when I pause it and come back later to finish the show it will play from the beginning instead of where I saved it. Though when looking at the episode picture it would show that I have stopped midway while watching. When trying to contact support, there was no location to do so on the website. I love the app to be able to follow and track my shows, but very disappointed with these issues. I have tried deleting and redownloading the app. Using it on my iPad."
2018-04-28 03:58:44,Having trouble loading my lineup?! Really?!,1,heyitsleigh,False,"Aside from the rewind/fast-forward problem, this app has worked perfectly fine. But now, all of a sudden, every single time i open the app it tells me that it’s “having trouble loading my lineup, check your internet.” There is nothing wrong with my internet because if there was I wouldn’t be writing this review right now. I’ve tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app 3 times and it’s still saying the same thing. I don’t know what yall did, but you need to fix it and fix it quickly or i’m canceling my subscription."
2018-03-12 03:43:15,Phone app hasn’t worked in 3 days,2,huluuser,False,"I’ve troubleshooted with my phone turning it on and off. Checked WiFi and data connection it’s nothing to do with that. I’ve also tried while logged onto tv and while not logged onto tv. Idkwhat the problem is but every time I go to open it, it stalls for a min and then completely closes. It does not give me an explanation or prompt me to do anything just closes. I wasn’t going to complain. Was waiting for it to work itself out but after 3 days I’m a little frustrated."
2020-08-06 20:28:57,One problem,4,Lil_pizookie,False,"I love The App It’s super useful! But one problem, I’m a Weeb so I like to watch anime, I’m from Arizona and I speak English and so I watch dubbed anime. So when I saw the dubbed episodes I got super excited, but the anime I really wanna watch diabolik lovers is all subtitles and they go to fast for me to read, and I know there’s a dubbed version cause my friends played it. So could you please put out dubbed anime series’s it would really help if you did!"
2018-01-24 04:23:34,Frustrated,2,TeraLeeC,False,Sometimes I wonder why? I'm paying actually $$$ for this ... it's been a pain lately ...with the constant rewinding and fast forwarding if I graze the screen ..buffering ...when my signal is fine ...now it won't even load .. finally got something to come up and it says to log back in ..when trying to log back in ...it gives me error try later ...this is what I'm paying for? I've deleted the app and downloaded it AGAIN ...and it still won't open ...this is not cool at all ...can someone fix this PLEASE
2017-12-10 10:46:05,"Bad UX, constantly bugs",1,Frenchie Lola,False,"Update: the controls make it inevitable that you will accidentally skip around in an episode if you try to pause the show or see how much time is left. Usually you’ll be stuck watching ads before you can try to find your place again in the episode. 

Previous:
Everytime I try watching a show I get an error message saying there's a problem playing the video. Have to close the app and restart it to resume watching. This can happen 4-7 times during a 30 minute show. For a paid service this is not acceptable"
2017-11-15 22:05:17,Poorly thought out,1,51 Stryker,False,"Editor's choice? Did the editor's actually use the app?  What a poorly thought out piece of software. I just quit watching a show out of frustration. Actually thinking of cancelling my subscription If you are not careful when touching the screen to pause a show, you can end up loosing your place. Which of course results in two long buffering times. Hey, you know iPads and phones are almost all screen in the front. When you move them you end up touching the screen. Anybody listening? Go back to the old slide bar and pause button. Use your heads."
2017-10-29 07:20:10,Please Fix,2,Nightmaree. >;],False,"I don’t leave reviews for apps ever, but this issue has really begun bothering me. When you go in a season the episodes are either missing or placed in another season. There will be 2 Season 5 Episode 17s. Obviously one is wrong and when I looked up what should be correct, one should be in season 4. Then once I looked at season 4, it has episode 15-17 missing. Those episodes are scattered somewhere throughout the seasons! You can’t follow a series in chronological order with the episodes out of order. Please fix this issue."
2017-09-21 13:42:52,Put the interface back!,1,XAQ 8,False,"I can't take this anymore! Over and over and over again, all I try to do is touch the 10-second rewind button, and the computer misinterprets my gesture and rewinds me back to the beginning! Which wouldn't be so bad if it didn't also replay the COMMERCIALS that I only rewound back through because you decided you wanted to try to be clever with the interface. REMOVE THE ABILITY TO USE ANYTHING BUT THE SCROLL BAR TO REWIND AND FAST FORWARD. It's simple and has always worked. I never want to experience this garbage interface ever again! Netflix doesn't try to pull this crap! Come on!"
2020-05-21 22:44:12,It’s good but has problems with ads,4,Julianx0214,False,Oh my god I love this app just these ads are just horrible they show no interest why are you showing a car ad on a kid show like what?!?! There is never something new when I comes to ads it’s the same thing all the time also why is there no ads in a movie but 3 or 4 ads in a episode of a show makes no sense but other than ads the app is good
2020-03-02 18:13:27,It’s good but a few cons,4,Mel675001,False,"I love the streaming BUT I don’t like that some show never go off my stuff. If you accidentally  record and go back to take it off it doesn’t go away. I’ve removed from my watchlist, disliked it and took it off my stuff and it comes back.

It spins awhile, hangs and then reports an error it is having trouble loading the content and I am to choose something else to watch.

2019-12-26 16:47:11,Can not force quality,3,BRmegaman,False,It’s annoying when I pay a good amount to have this service and have unlimited data yet cannot force HD content...used to be able to pick my stream (and can in basically every other streaming app) but in this one the only available option is “best available” which has a terrible algorithm to determine because with 50mbps download it’s still fuzzy...be nice if I could once again choose 720p...
2019-12-16 07:49:17,App Keeps Crashing,1,brit_knows,False,"So annoying. I can’t watch complete shows. Keeps crashing and giving me an error message that there is no internet connection but my Verizon service LTE and other apps are working fine. Sometimes it works sometimes it doesn’t. Also if I have to leave the app for any reason and come back mid watching something, the app refreshes itself and I’m forced to search whatever I was watching again. Very frustrating. Not sure if the app is no longer compatible with the older version of Apple phone I’m on (iPhone 7) or not. Please help!!"
2018-11-05 03:10:22,More seasons,5,Broxton2,False,I don’t mind waiting the 24 hours to see my favorite shows but I do hate when I can not binge watch a new show (to me). It is very hard to pick up what is going on when you do not have the beginning seasons. And Netflix doesn’t have them either. I just won’t watch the show if I can not see it from the start.
2019-11-27 22:59:03,Sensitive,3,👌👋😦🏀😢,False,"I love Hulu,whenever I’m on it I can find movies/shows that I can’t god on any other viewing app. But there is one major issue that I have been having with this app is the fact that it is so sensitive even if I’m on my ipad or phone if I accidentally touch the screen it will either x me out or fast forward it can be annoying. All in all,it’s a good app but it does have a few issues thanks 😊

                        PLEASE POST THIS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2019-09-15 02:13:56,Sports viewing is frustrating at best,1,Gdb111,False,"Cannot fast forward past commercials (this is how they make their money). Had very weird playback during a football game that was extremely glitchy. Every time I wanted to watch a different game other than the one I had recorded, it would start back at the beginning of the broadcast and would not let me fast forward to live due to it being an advertisement (there were no advertisements!!!). Very much considering going back to cable. The functionality is extremely lacking compared to regular cable."
2019-04-02 01:19:18,It's ALWAYS crashing,1,Miguel Cabelin,False,"Whenever I use it, the app crashes when I try to watch something. It always bugs out and freezes, and I can't pause it, turn it off, and even when I press the home button, the audio keeps playing. It also glitches by zooming into one area of the screen and sticking there for a while and the captions always freeze too. The only way I can stop it is if I delete the app and get it again... but it still crashes and I have to re-download it for it to really work for only two seconds. Someone please fix this!"

I have given the app permission to access my location information in settings.  I can delete the app, sign in again, give it permission to access my location information, and it will sometimes work.  Sometimes I have to repeat this more than once.  I am not getting what I paid for!"
2018-10-27 07:38:53,Please add ‘marked as watched’,5,itunes_blah,False,"This is so bad, I don’t need every episode of every show in my watch list, especially as I’ve watched them!!! I need to be able mark whole seasons or individual episodes as watched as I have no idea when a new episode is available. I end up going to the latest show list in iTunes just to find out what’s new."

So all in all get this app, or don’t I mean idrc🤷‍♀️ have a nice day kiddos and remember to take your vitamins :))))))"
2018-10-19 04:04:03,Temperamental app,2,dissed fan,False,"Ever since iOS 12 the app is freezing at times. Could not close it yesterday and I had to delete app and reinstall it then it was OK for a while until I paused a show. When I resumed it the pause bottom did not fade out for the remainder of the episode. 
I also find the frequent commercials irritating and agree that if the option to pay a higher fee to get rid of them is not available that perhaps playing them once at start of show and once mid show would be more palatable."
2018-10-04 18:33:59,"Glitches, Witches, and Bugs. OH MY!",1,BlakeDancing,False,"Pretty close to cancelling this garbage. In the past 24 hrs the Apple TV app was looping from 0 to 30 seconds in some shows. Guide was showing incomplete guide lists. Feed was cutting in and out. Watched a TV show after it had aired on demand and got alllll the commercials despite paying extra for no commercials on such shows. It had worked great over the spring and summer. But now it feels like an awful, rushed release by a bunch of amateurs. I’m sure it’s some idiot, self-assured VP rushing the devs. Please look around for all your schtuff, put it in a bag, and get it together. Get your schtuff together."
2018-08-11 05:41:56,Crap,5,mrdontgiveashit,False,This app has a lot of bugs. It is constantly buffering no matter how good my internet connection is. I would not recommend this app due to it not being able to load a show or movie in a convenient time frame. This last update made this problem significantly worse then it was before.
2018-04-14 11:29:03,App is not working on mobile devices,5,Random hero1015,False,"We purchased the live streaming package and as of 3 days now this app is not working. It refers me to internet or network settings yet there is not wrong with my network. Also the latest version is not providing us with the quality we use the enjoy.
Disappointed and need a fix"
2018-03-18 23:50:45,Pretty good: has a few user interface problems.,4,TAEllison,False,I like the app and the service I get but the slider at the bottom which allows you to go to different points in the video you are watching is sensitive and can be affected by touching anywhere on the screen. I have several times found myself accidentally fast forwarding half an hour when all I wanted was to press pause.
2018-03-19 19:13:22,REMOVE screen fast forward and rewind,1,Tony_toe,False,"I have had enough of this app. Today I had two minutes left on a show. I paused the episode and my finger made this feature rewind the episode back a few minutes past the advertisement break, which then caused a 90 second advertisement to pop up. When that was over, I had to fast forward the episode back to where it was and again. ANOTHER 90 second ad. All-in-all, I wasted over 5 minutes trying to get back to where the video was—all because of this extremely inconvenient feature! PLEASE REMOVE IT."
2017-11-19 17:35:22,Totally non functional on mr less than year old iPad Pro.,4,West Coast Bob,False,"After the last update, this app stopped working on my iPad.  I even tried deleting and reinstalling the app.  To no avail.  After the opening screen, when I try to select a program, it just spins and spins forever.  I am not happy paying monthly for an app that doesn’t work from a company that obviously does not give a rip about it’s customers."
2020-04-28 00:05:00,Great...,4,Lisa Delgado Brown,False,"I love the app, but for some reason it just won't let me download it. Maybe it's my I pad being second gen... but it has gone through a lot. Also some shows aren't even the whole series like Steven universe. And I'm sad because when I want to watch something like the owl house, it isin't there!  But it has great quality and I respect that. Overall, it is a great app. It could use some minor fixes."
2017-11-01 17:35:42,What the heck???,3,BfromD,False,"One of my favorite streaming platforms but this revised interface stinks!!!  It’s hard to find what you want to watch and much more difficult to do the things you once were able to do.  

Used to be able to delete things from my history, so if I didn’t like them they wouldn’t continue to show up I my queue.  No longer ☹️. Now I have to log in via pc. 

Hard to find anything good to say about the app. Big disappointment!!!"
2017-09-28 04:22:05,Please change this,1,es1128,False,"I’ve been subscribed for about 2 years now and I now hate using this app. Whenever I’m watching a show if I accidentally tap the screen the show will fast forward/rewind to where ever I hit, its most annoying because I like watching shows while I work out and I have to be extra careful when tapping the screen to see the time. Also I find it very confusing to find shows I’m currently watching, under my stuff there’s shows I watched a couple episodes of months ago, I preferred the last version, it wasn’t pretty but heck it did its job."
2017-09-12 12:20:36,App update doesn't support IOS devices,1,Molambs,False,"The app has lost all functionality for me after this update, making it essentially useless. The new app no longer supports IOS streaming via HDMI. I've used this app for over a year to stream from my phone to tv and now ads will play normally but no picture comes up for the programming only the sound. I don't know why they would make this drastic change. Additionally, the new interface isn't user friendly: difficult to navigate and missing user profile information. Overall, the update is a big ZERO!"
2020-07-30 06:18:44,New layout is garbage.,1,abnormally long stupid name,False,After the most recent update they basically started using the Netflix bar slider system and when you use it on anything but a pic or tablet you can click view all. Meaning on your smart tv or Xbox you have to scroll threw movies a-z left to right which will take hours. Making you spend even more time sifting threw movies to find one you want. They also keep taking away new release sections for movies so again maki nag you have to scroll left to right threw genres trying to find new releases. Time wasting menus for no reason. Garbage!!!!!
2020-01-15 05:37:27,Ok but should be better,2,Hulu needs help,False,"Decent but too many issues for 2020 streaming. If you need to restart an episode they make you rewatch ads even though you have already seen them? (This is the cheaper ad version, yes I know I could upgrade but I won’t.)

Why can’t I see a list of what I have already watched? You watch something and it disappears so you can never recommend a show to your friend.

Also why aren’t there separate profiles? Not everyone in a household has the same age restrictions and tastes. Fail."
2019-10-03 23:20:32,Rate option,5,usama salem 19907863,False,"We want the ability to give our rates to the content inside the app. Either rating by stars or by giving a thumbs up or down.

It would be nice to have one and not watch the whole thing but that is all!"
2019-01-12 16:46:48,Amazing app,5,chillkidisa,False,"Love the different shows it has it has multiple selections to choose from but some shows i love to watch like the simpsons, modern family, or gotham dont have the previous seasons to watch like the old episodes from the simpsons where the best and i would love to binge watch all of those previous seasons and episodes."
2019-07-17 00:15:34,Almost unwatchable,1,JazmynFL,False,"It won’t play a movie straight through. It will keep starting it over from the beginning. It’s very, very frustrating to have to keep hunting for where you were, start watching again, then 10 minutes later it glitches up again and starts over from the beginning.  Even more frustrating when the app spontaneously closes the control screen for the movie, forcing you to have hunt for the movie and THEN fast forward to where you were. 

I have never seen a paid streaming service perform this poorly."
2019-07-12 11:08:34,Unusable on IPad,1,jeranne,False,"App completely unusable after update on older iPad. Nor can I watch via browser on the same iPad as it's an ""unsupported"" version of a supported browser. Prior to this the old version worked just fine.

Why not just have a canned answer saying you no longer support the last app version on this device and call it a day? Let the old version run but don't provide tech support for it. At this point I don't know what I'm paying for. 

I'm certainly not going to run out and buy a new iPad for a single app when HBO, Netflix, and Prime apps still work fine."
2018-12-01 18:23:36,No,5,Returnsoave,False,I do not like the newest update. The way my information is organized is not convenient. It makes it harder to search and I can no longer see my history or have control over it. There is no where that explains that on the app or on the web. Thinking about deleting my entire account.
2017-10-04 01:14:46,New update,5,Zebra~chick,False,I have had this for about a year now and everything worked fine until the new update. Every time I try to watched something it pauses and tells me there is a connection error. I am trying to reinstall the app and now it won't even download! I will be cancelling my serve if it doesn't reinstall by tonight! Junk!
2018-10-25 15:21:23,There is always something wrong..,2,littlitta,False,"I really don’t understand why this app constantly has issues. For a while it was just that the app was poorly designed and hard to navigate, but now it’s evolved to sometimes it just doesn’t work. It has trouble going from ads to the show. It sometimes won’t even load the show or ads until I shut down my entire phone, and then it’ll work once. When it’s working, it works fine, but it doesn’t work anywhere near consistantly."
2018-10-24 20:04:11,No Details,3,Mr. Sarcastic,False,"Recently, I was going through my shows and I tapped on one of them to show more detail. When I did so, a message popped up saying “Error” in bold letters above, “The operation couldn’t be completed.” Under that, “(HuluAPI. Parse Error error 0)” I was given the option to select either “retry” or “ I just noticed this issue today, and seeing as how everything was working yesterday, this is a very recent issue. I beseech you; please resolve this as soon as possible."
2018-05-28 00:11:24,Wifi,2,IAmNumber21,False,"I love the app itself; it has lots of great tv shows and movies that can’t be offered many other places. However, it doesn’t run very well unless you have perfect five-star wifi. I’ll be watching an episode and it would pause like six different times within the 20 minute show. it’s very inconvenient to wait 5 minutes for it to start playing again. If I’m watching on Netflix, it very rarely, if ever, pauses at all throughout my watching experience, no matter how long the episode or movie is."
2018-03-11 01:12:35,Terrible,3,ChanelRebel,False,"The changes made to this app are drastic and useless. The overall design of the app now is just not user friendly. Very confusing and not to mention, the rewind feature. I accidentally touch the screen in the wrong place and it rewinds back several minutes and plays 80 second ads on top of that. How can anyone think the new design/functionality of the app is an improvement? App developer what were you thinking? :/"
2017-12-05 19:39:42,so slow and frustrating,1,Lovelyyemy,False,i think it was my wifi that makes this app act slow but i realized it wasnt when i’m able to go on netflix and experience it perfectly fine and fast. this app makes it frustrating to watch the shows i want because it takes forever to just even start anything and theres constant ads/commercials. i think me PAYING monthly should atleast require less commercials and FAST service. considering deleting because of how slow this app is. netflix is much faster while on the same wifi connection.
2017-10-18 17:14:47,Huge design flaw,1,Jamison125637,False,"I’m sure you’ve seen this complaint 100 times already but I feel it needs to be said again. The tap the screen to fast forward feature does not work correctly and constantly results in unintentional jumping. 

Let me be clear: this is not a growing pain. This is not something that your users are going to simply get used too. Is is far to easy to accidentally jump to a different spot in your movie and spoil the plot. The feature itself is flawed and I beg you to consider removing it, this would greatly imposed the user experience."
2017-10-10 01:40:45,F- for app functionality,1,DWatts12,False,"This app (for the iPad at least) is so horrible, my dead grandmother could've done better. If you're watching a show and tap on the screen to pause it, it will fast forward or rewind you to wherever you tapped on the screen. Another thing, when you're browsing through shows or movies and you tap on a show/movie and hit the back arrow to keep looking, it will take you back to the top almost every time. Very disappointed and dissatisfied. For $10+ dollars a month plus ads, you guys could do so much better than you are."
2019-12-15 17:57:19,Like the ability to download,5,LaCasBianco,False,"I really like the fact that many programs can be downloaded since I am in a location where cellular signal is not the greatest, but I noticed a minor bug that the programs in the “my stuff” folders does not update when watching downloaded programs."
2017-09-29 05:46:16,Horrible update!! Watchlist feature deleted!!,1,Kstrohte89,False,"You also can't view which shows used to be on the watchlist in their new feature, you can't see which shows from your old watchlist have new episodes (very inconvenient for keeping track of fall season premieres), and they don't even have a section featured for new fall season premieres!!  Also very difficult to navigate and not user-friendly.  And you have to scroll for way too long to go down a list, because all the images are too big and take up the whole screen one at a time."
2017-09-21 04:42:25,Never loads,2,Sarah-ndipity,False,"I use the roku app most of the time and I love pretty much every thing about it. The new design is lovely, I find the interface easy to use, I love that they added profiles, and the content is excellent as always. However, with the new update it can't load my shows any more. It buffers about halfway and then says there's a connection problem. I've checked my internet multiple times and there's no problem there and none of my other apps struggle to connect, so I'm not sure what the issue is"
2020-07-14 05:32:25,New glitches...,3,Callie_Maggotbone,False,"... but it might be related to the newest Apple software update. However, I give the benefit of the doubt before the dev gets a chance to release an update. The new problem I’ve been experiencing is that the app on both iPhone and Apple TV require a power cycle or restart after several hours of non-use. This shouldn’t happen simply bc I was at work all day. I also have a Fire Stick, and the app works fine with no issue."
2020-04-28 17:02:30,Won’t let me open app,4,audraking,False,"Was watching a show just fine, then it crashed. Now won’t let me open the app at all!!! Just crashes before it loads anything. I’ve deleted and re downloaded twice, reset my phone twice. Nothing’s helping. Thanks guys. Please fix before you bill me again?.... mmkay 🤗

Will update when problem fixed..

They fixed it after 5 hours."
2020-03-18 15:50:32,Seems to be going downhill,3,Extrakun,False,"Had no problems with the app until sometime last year, they did an update that overrides all my alarms. So if I am casting from my phone overnight, my alarm will not go off in the morning! Today, March 18, 2020, it keeps acting up. I can’t pause or play while casting, it doesn’t show me options to do so on the phone, and every time my phone goes to sleep, I have to restart it because it lost the place I was watching."
2019-03-13 00:22:31,Not worth the staircase on my phone,5,Candycane1991,False,"This app won’t let me stream from my iPhone. Even after turning my phone on and off, everything updated and even attempting using my data or the WiFi- it still doesn’t work. 
I have to watch my shows from the computer. 
Don’t waste your time downloading this app."
2019-07-02 03:26:37,update makes me start new shows without meaning to,1,edvgwexuyvw,False,"I never leave ratings for apps but this was the easiest system to use and then they updated it to a system where it’s hard to see what shows are on, which ones I have, and what are available with one show on the screen at a time. 

Then every time I pick up my phone and hit the screen when I’m watching something it changes it to a different episode. Put it back to the way it was as it used to be a great app but now I’m thinking about unsubscribing because it’s so annoying."
2019-05-22 13:24:36,It’s difficult just to get an episode to work,3,king spiffy,False,"I got this app about 6 months ago and it’s great, but lately it’s been acting up so much. Losing my place when I go back to finish an episode, the episodes may not ever load, or it’ll just pop up with message saying that it can’t be played right now and I should try turning my phone on and off. I don’t know if this is just me experiencing this but...I love the app, it’s just been bugging out lately."
2019-05-21 13:14:36,I'm disappointed...,1,"Theo, a saddened customer",False,"I am overall very happy with this app however I cannot give it more than one star because of one simple thing it's lacking: downloading shows. I, and many, many other people would get so much more enjoyment out of this app if we could watch our favorite shows offline. Netflix's app has this feature and it's just wonderful and I've given them a five star review because of this wonderful feature. I hope you fix this issue quickly because I'd very much love to watch Game of Thrones without wrecking my data. Thank you."
2017-10-30 21:22:46,Great,5,Themystery2,False,"I don't know why everyone is triggered enough to give this amazing app an average 2 star rating, but I think this app is great. If you guys don't like it, then just bring your laptop everywhere with you, 'cause, honestly, you're to triggered to deal with a few small flaws on this app.
I'm glad I can watch my show whenever, wherever I want to now. Thanks"
2018-11-16 01:13:29,"Ohhhh, these ‘bug fix releases’ just add more bugs!",1,Dk Nite,False,"If you need testers prior to a release; I volunteer. These releases are awful!  Even though I pay extra for reduced or no commercials, most everything I watch have full commercials. When I want to fast forward through the commercials, it is now a multi step process. Have to launch app (1), reconnect to device (2), select the active program (3), then fast forward (4).  

The delete icon is now hidden behind the active program. WHY????  Are your programmers doing the testing and validation too????  Please correct your process!"
2018-11-04 13:04:32,How I like and how I don’t like it,3,melissamillerm,False,If it is not all in Dub you can’t watch it but if you understand sub you can watch it and the movie are sometimes have sub but like I said if you don’t understand what they are saying then you can’t watch but if you do understand what they are saying then it’s ok to watch them I know I can’t understand what they are saying to me sub don’t make sense anything not in English I don’t understand what they are saying to me there is my review.
2018-05-07 00:51:33,Excellent TV shows,4,xxlilelizaxx91,False,I will admit when you’re watching something on here. That sometimes when you pause and come back it is annoying to come to a commercial. For the most part I love this app because of the TV shows that they stream. But I would recommend making some updates. I think that will bring a lot more customers if you would fix it.
2018-03-24 00:20:18,"Constantly degraded with ""upgrades""",2,swom1,False,"As someone who has worked in the software industry for over 20yrs I have rarely seen this level of constant, ongoing degradation of a once fine app with no response from development. First they separate the app from other TV apps and the online interface. Then they constantly make the user interface and experience worse with each upgrade. I wish I could get a job where I did this poor quality of work and could still keep my job."
2020-09-28 20:35:42,Good,4,King of lash,False,It is really good and I love the variety of shows but for some reason my pause button and rewind and forward button won’t work on the new update. Like I can double tap the screen to fade press but it won’t work on the actual button. Also when I don’t have it full screen it works fine just only when full screen is it like this. Don’t know why.
2017-10-01 16:12:04,So ridiculous... where’s the cast icon?,1,Blix318,False,"I don’t like this new version. I have to scroll through everything I don’t watch. I have to constantly search for shows I watch instead of being able to click on it. Also, the cast icon is always disappearing on me. I can cast one day, but then have to troubleshoot another day, just to get the icon back. These apps and streaming services we pay for, are supposed to be easier to use. I work enough at my job of which I get paid. I shouldn’t have to be annoyed and work harder for  something I pay for"
2017-09-27 06:33:17,The old UI was better.,2,richa637,False,The saying don’t fix what isn’t broken needs to be applied here. The new interface looks minimal and everything looks bigger but it’s difficult to use. The old interface was better and I could access my history and account settings. This version tells me to access them through the web address. This update is a step down not a step up. I will not be using the new update to find new shows. Please bring the old app and layout back.
2017-09-14 02:28:56,Update decreases ability to find shows,1,LCovino,False,"Unnecessary and ambiguous navigation,  I don't really know where I need to go to find my content, why isn't my watch lists the first thing I see? the company has made users work to find if shows they watch have new episodes.  This new update forces you to swipe through a bunch of content you *might* like in order to find what's on your list. 

Finding new shows to watch seems so difficult and clunky I will never do it on my mobile or iPad apps at this point. Terrible upgrade. Did you do any user testing?"
2020-10-11 18:17:08,Chromcasting doesn’t work like it used to,1,Lfunkadelick,False,"After enjoying the app for several months (years?), an update several weeks ago made pausing a chromcasted show nearly impossible. Today, I updated the app again hoping it would be fixed. But now the casting icon does not even indicate that it’s working, and I can pause but not rewind or fast forward. 

These bugs have made it so frustrating that I find myself avoiding using the app entirely, opting for something on prime or Netflix. Their apps chromcast seamlessly. And I can even pause a show! What a concept!!"
2020-10-08 20:23:51,Just a question about the PiP and its not working,3,DixieEnormous,False,"It was working couple days ago the Picture-in-Picture setting on the latest IOS update, but I don’t have a reason why it isn’t working now. Anyone have a solution to fix this? If you don’t know what PiP, it’s a thing where you can watch a video or episode without being on the app, so you can do whatnot such as texting or looking through emails while watching your show."
2020-09-20 04:02:47,Ad overload,4,cpear🍐,False,"This app is pretty good and easy to use. The selection is overall very decent. However, I really dislike the amount of ads when you watch a show. I understand that businesses need to advertise but it’s just annoying. If I wanted ads I would go back to cable. I like to get through the show with no interruptions. There is a pause button for a reason."
2020-09-23 00:58:39,Pause Doesn’t Work,2,LauraP225,False,"From the reviews I updated to ios 14 too late to use PIP before it went away, but my pause and play buttons don’t work anymore. If I need to pause to go read a text in a different screen, I have to exit out completely. When my show paused automatically because I took out my airpods the play button didn’t work either so I had to exit out to get in again so it would play. This seems like pretty basic functionality. I have the ad-free subscription."
2019-11-24 17:44:56,Ads Are Outta Hand,3,Rose2TheTop,False,"Shows are cool, but I hate the ad version. I don’t know if there’s a glitch in the newer version, but if I rewind 10 secs and it’s close to the last ad break I’m forced to watch the whole 90sec ad clip AGAIN. Super annoying. I’m not buying a GMC truck/SUV, I’m not switching over to Cricket..I just want to watch my shows, be able to rewind and not watch 15mins of commercials for a 30min show. Please fix this issue if it’s a glitch cause it’s getting outta hand."
2020-03-12 15:18:32,Buffering extreme issue,1,redwardtjr,False,"I tried you out for the free trial and oh my, it was not good. The buffering is horrible! Various channels buffered off and on constantly. Today I tried to watch a show on one of the local channels  and it buffered so much I couldn’t continue to watch. Then it was skipping back 5 seconds and then again and again. Talk about a waste of time. Good thing I did not have to pay. According to other reviews it appears this has been an issue for  a while. The pricing is way too high also and for this type of service? No thanks."
2019-12-07 08:57:08,"Too many ads to much lag, Netflix is way better",1,Retyinsgditkf,False,"Having to pay 5.99 for the ad supported plan is outrageous. It is supposed to be limited ads but you get one as soon as you start and episode and 3 others a long. Each one lasting around 30-90 seconds. This is pretty much as many ads as other websites give when watching their content for free. They are definitely putting their money above quality, which is understandable, but this is to much. I’d rather just watch stuff on Netflix or somewhere else. I’m cancelling my subscription."
2019-06-22 02:03:00,Help please fix,5,sotnas21,False,Overall great app but I pay for this and can’t even watch a movie or show with out it telling me to “turn my phone or wireless router off and wait a few minutes then try again” and this is non stop for every time I try. But I go to Netflix and boom i have no problems! Please fix ASAP or I’ll have to unsubscribe
2020-04-07 18:24:30,The app,5,ALSHFR04,False,This app is amazing. It has a great variety of shows and it is just fantastic. I do hope that in the future there are less ads but they’re not too bad. Sometimes I do have to force close the app to get it to work but other than that it is great. I would definitely would recommend it.
2019-03-27 19:41:47,I can’t even log in,2,BNicole7,False,"I am already signed in on my phone and when I try to watch something the next day, it makes me sign out or retry. So I retry ten times and then finally decide to sign in. It says there’s a connection problem when I have excellent WiFi. So I try again using data and I have full bars also. Still the same problem. What’s the point of paying for the subscription if I can never even use it? It’s only THIS app and it’s only on the app. On my Roku it seems to work fine."
2018-10-17 19:35:25,Wont sync shows from app to web,2,blkbxr,False,"Few issues:
When i add shows to my watchlist from apple tv, it wont show up in my app and vice versa. How do you get them to sync up? 
When binging a show, now it wont play the next episode, it jumps to a completely different show not even on the watchlist. 
Lastly, when watching on the app when you initially start playing a show, it starts off small in the corner, and you have to go thru the steps to full screen it (which is pain when you have an old ipad)"
2018-10-09 01:21:01,Most Of The Same Issues,2,babieK,False,"After the most recent update many old problems haven’t gone away.
The screen freezes while sound continues, subtitle spontaneously turn off and I have to exit the app to make them reappear. When exiting the app, my place in what I’m watching isn’t saved so I have to start at the beginning and watch commercials again. Why are there so many ads when we are paying a monthly fee? Other popular streaming apps do not have us watch irrelevant ads."
2018-06-17 01:56:18,Error?,3,bdubose57,False,"use the app frequently but for a few shows (typically really popular shows), an error message pops up: “Error The operation couldn’t be completed HuluAPI. Parse Error error 2”. looked it up online and the results just said to close the app, restart my phone, or delete and re-download the app. after doing all of those things, the error message still pops up. would really appreciate if this got fixed bc it’s really annoying."
2018-02-27 17:41:16,Poor UX for a streaming app,1,DMillzilla,False,"This app is absolutely beautiful and content is displayed to portray the essence of the show/movie. Unfortunately, it is an awful browsing experience. It takes way too long to browse content or discover new shows. Ultimately, it discourages you from finding new content. It also makes it difficult to locate shows you like. I would have unsubscribed by now if it weren’t for the fact that it’s the only viable business model that has next-day streaming. I just wish they thought more about their customer’s in-app experience."
2018-02-13 01:53:47,Won’t even let me log in??,1,SamW718,False,"I try to log in and restore my purchase and then it brings me to a screen to finish creating an account, which I already have. It tells me I already have an account and kicks me back to the log-in screen? Literally will not even let me log in. Tried to log in a different way and it tells me to pick my subscription preference (which I’ve already done) and then it tells me I’m already subscribed! What’s the point of paying if I can’t even get to the point of being able to watch a show?? Canceling subscription!"
2018-01-24 02:47:46,Update horrible,2,CST&RT,False,"Now nothing works after the update. Reinstalled the app, updated password login and reinstalled the app twice again.....The app doesn’t even open? It was working last weekend and decided to watch a movie tonight and nothing works. Please fix this ASAP! Thank you. Lost all my data! Reinstalled a third time and the screen is stuck and will NOT open!
I am really disappointed.... it’s now 2 hours later and still the app won’t open!!!! And I just paid for another month!"
2018-01-13 22:25:44,Ehhh..,3,AllyMelton,False,"Don’t get me wrong...
It’s nice for Live TV & everything, but the choice for channels is VERY slim & it’s constantly pausing & skipping (we have the fastest internet speed there is, so it isn’t on our end), plus I’ve seen reviews that complain of the same thing. I also wish there was a “guide” section like regular TV Providers have, rather than having to go to the channel and see the lineup. For $40 a month, there should be more variety of channel choices in my opinion."
2017-11-30 23:36:20,This use to be a close 5 stars for me....,1,Lyssa_7777777,False,The ads have always been annoying. Due to the recent update I’ve had to watch a 60 ad four times. I just wanted to pause the show and I missed the button by an inch and it’s rewinding it back. It’s extremely annoying and it kind of forces you to pay for the version that has no ads. Also I paid there was a deal for minimal ad breaks and I have the same amount as usual I don’t see the point. This is extremely annoying and I’m about to end my subscription revert it back or make it less sensitive.
2017-09-22 04:42:52,One star for the new update,1,Fantastika822,False,"I've had this app for a while and never had any major issues, but this new update is horrible. For example, as opposed to showing all of my recently watched in one neat line across the site, now I can only see one show filling the entire screen at a time, and it only flips through a smattering of shows I actually watch. It is not at all intuitive, and I've completely stopped watching on my iPad. Thank god I still have the old app on AppleTv or I'd be cancelling my subscription. Please go back to the original format. Substance over style!"
2020-09-09 09:19:19,Forcing us to pay more,1,Jackaboyishere,False,This app is a joke the ads are ridiculous if I don’t pay more money I get bombarded with 1 minute 30 second long ads while only getting 2 minutes of the show at a time I should not have to give you all of my money because u feel the need to put an add every 2 seconds do u know how annoying it is to be in the middle of someone’s death see just to get smacked in the face by an eharmoney ad with their terrible acting and horrible lines just thinking about it makes me wanna break my phone over someone’s head
2020-06-17 23:43:33,It’s okay but get rid of those mothefriggin ads!!!!,3,Xclussiive,False,Why am I paying for a service for it to still give me ads and if I go back 10 seconds when it’s only 9 it replays the ad after already watching it or if I accidentally go back and try to it still replays it. Also I keep seeing the same ads and they’re extremely repetitive and whenever I go back it plays the ad even when there wasn’t one there
2020-04-16 10:41:56,5 ads in one show?!,2,fanaticdomains,False,"The ads on this app are ridiculous. A subscription that’s almost $7 just so that you could give me at least 4 ads ranging anywhere from 20-90 seconds? Netflix, Disney +, and prime video are all better choices. Sure they cost a little more, but it’s worth it to not see the same 4 ads multiple  times in one episode. If viewers can get less ad time, then I’d like to keep my subscription, but as of now, I’m canceling as soon as I’m done binging the couple of shows like."
2020-03-26 07:02:51,Way to many ads,3,dcyths,False,The app is fine and works well the only problem I have with it are the ads you have to pay for a subscription to keep watching stuff but then you still get ads that are way too long and unskipable which by the way can go up to 100 seconds and there about four ads every video. My opinion the app would be way better if there was a skip feature.
2020-01-20 09:12:42,The same commercials,3,AddNVan,False,"I don’t pay for the plan to skip the advertisements and honestly I don’t mind them all that much, but throughout the course of a few episodes I will see the same three commercials over and over agin. If you’re going to have people pay less to see commercials at least give them something different to watch, I seem to get a progressive insurance commercial every commercial break!"
2019-10-08 21:32:03,Glitch with “watch history”,3,scfelisme,False,"Lately, after i watch a show it still shows under the list to “resume watching” instead of “caught up”.
I also started watching a new show and am on the second episode, but when I pause and come back to it, I have to start over again because it shows no watch history.
I updated the app and not fixed.
It is also happening on the app on my Vizio TV.
Help!!!’"
2019-12-02 22:43:06,Constant crashing,1,desiora1,False,"Would be great if the app didn’t crash every few minutes to the point where I have no hope of ever finishing a show. And it seems like they’ve had these iOS troubles for years. I have no issues on my Samsung phone, but on my iPad I’m constantly frustrated with the terrible performance of this app. Every time it crashes I’m forced to watch more ads to get back to the place I was in the show. I don’t mind ads but when I watch 15 minutes of them in a row because the app has crashed 7 times I get annoyed"
2019-11-28 15:36:20,I know why it is so cheap (16 ads per 30-min episode),1,TheReal_IanMc,False,"Just signed up for a promotional deal. I had decided that $12/month wasn’t worth it, but when they later announced a $2/month offer I decided why not? 
Well, after watching one show, I now understand why they can offer a membership for so little: they BOMBARD you with crappy ads. At this point, it seems like they should be paying me, or at least totally free. I stopped watching broadcast TV largely due to all the terrible ads. Now I get to suffer through the same torture, but this time for a fee."
2019-03-02 03:12:47,"Great app, wish layout was more organized",5,Thdirj1234567890furhfheifbcoe,False,"I love this app, but I wish the layout was better. It’s difficult to simply go to the next episode sometimes, and it doesn’t really keep track of the episode you are on? Also the general layout could be better. Other than that, it’s a pretty good about"
2019-10-07 13:20:04,Not updating properly,2,Richlaca,False,"After I watch a program on My Stuff, it used to come off the watch next list and say all caught up. This is not happening. It is telling me to watch the same episode over again as if I had never watched it. This is getting very confusing. I hope it gets fixed soon. I would have contacted support about this but I have to go through too many gateways to just tell them they have a problem. How about making that easier too."
2019-06-27 01:52:49,Traveling.,1,handmaids tale,False,"So i am currently abroad. Not sure if it has to do with my location but I have an American based account that i HAVE been watching the handmaids tale on, well since arriving in Germany. On the app i see the show in my recently watched and it even goes as far as telling me there’s a new episode, however, the entire show (all three seasons) are currently unavailable. Well it’s nothing to do with my account, it’s clearly the issue of being in a different country even though I’m logged into my standard account. It’s just simply annoying and very unappreciated."
2019-06-26 03:14:42,Want my money back,1,Tigger1999876,False,"Way too glitchy. First problem, took several minutes for me to log into my account after paying and said I didn’t have an account. Next problem, the picture kept glitching and the volume on my tv kept going all the way up and down. Last problem, emailed for tech support and got an email back saying they no longer provide help anymore, even though it was the contact provided in my email receipt for troubleshooting. I would give it zero stars if I could and definitely want my money back!!"
2019-06-03 03:34:03,What happened?!,2,151515151515262626262,False,"Never really had a problem with the app until recently. Now, it regularly wants to tell me there is a connection problem on my end, telling me to try restarting the app and/or device and/or router. I don’t think so. I can instantaneously switch to any other app and it works flawlessly so get YOUR app working again! There are SO MANY options for streaming these shows/channels, especially as a cable subscriber, so it’s not something I’ll continue to pay for much longer."
2019-05-16 00:13:04,Needs work,3,lindadonaldson,False,We just got live and having a few problems. My husband has been talking to the TV because he hates that if 2 seconds was left on a show we watch and he wants to start the next episode it reverts back to the previous show. I do not like that many of my favorite shows do not come up in the keep watching area. I have gotten used to this interface now and get around it fairly ok but it is not easy.
2019-03-27 13:15:19,Hate this app!,2,Oak hill 4991,False,"In all the years I’ve been using this app, there were occasional glitches but over all it was a positive experience. Unfortunately, for quite some time now, it has been riddled with crashes, the sound skips like and old record player, the layout is awful, and often, you can’t remove shows from favorites. I keep waiting for the issues to disappear with each update but it seems this company is content with things as they are."
2018-10-18 21:15:30,Very few crashes,5,Corneliuos,False,"Content is, what it is. Now video quality is excellent. Google Cast works awesome.  Unlike other video streaming apps, it will crash only one out of ten uses (just an estimate). I wish it would have a download to device feature for when traveling on plane where no signal is available."
2018-12-30 18:48:40,Changing subscriptions,3,amsghd,False,Do not get this through Itunes go to the website and get it. If you want to change your subscription through ITunes you have to unsubscribe wait for what you paid for to end then resubscribe through the website I should be able to change what I want through the app or at least the website without having to do all this just because I'm paying through ITunes.
2018-03-14 18:35:00,Over all I’m happy!!,5,daughterin11,False,"I love how simple this app is, no scrolling through like Netflix I always find something enjoyable to watch. I love the 10 second rewind/fast forward option, especially with unnecessary sex scenes. People complain about the tapping the screen and it fast forwards but it hasn’t been annoying for me. Keep doing good work!!"
2018-09-04 04:41:29,Are You Still Watching,1,the3harters,False,"UPDATE:  It’s even worse - the “ARE YOU STILL WATCHING” is occurring much sooner!  WHAT A HORRIBLE WAY TO TREAT YOUR CUSTOMERS!!     It is horrible you have added this non-sense!!  Now we have to stop what we are doing just to let you know we are still there!!! This was one of the biggest benefits over Netflix and now you both are lame.  What’s worse is the pretense that you are helping us not miss anything from the show we are watching!  If some idiot can’t figure out what they’ve seen and what they haven’t, shame on you for punishing those of us that get how this service works!"
2018-05-26 14:33:17,Episode Order/ Number,4,Birdie 12345678910111213,False,"So it’s great and all that you have dubs AND subs for Japanese anime and such, but I noticed that for one of the Animes I was watching the second season starts at episode 13/14 ( I am talking about my hero academia ) and I can’t find it’s episodes anywhere else. Just wanted to bring it to light that not all tv shows always have every single episode which really messes up the whole experience."
2018-04-03 17:02:27,Not a fan of the updated look,3,FoxWhoTraveled,False,"They made the app more flashy but it’s not user friendly. It was great the old way, easy to navigate. 

That’s not my main complaint. I cannot get rid of “9-1-1” from my watchlist. It will not go away. I’ve tried deleting the app, restarting my phone, adding and removing it from “My Stuff” on the app and in a PC browser. It refuses to go away and it’s driving me nuts. I don’t want to watch it, but I get told when new episodes are out."
2018-03-17 19:58:15,New Version is Horrible,1,InPain,False,Tapping on the screen makes the whole screen go gray and won’t return to normal until you tap again which often results in the video randomly skipping significantly forward or back and causing you to watch an entire extra set of commercials before you can try to return to where you were. Doesn’t seem to be compatible with new iPad picture in picture feature as it freezes and you can’t close the pip. Also there are noticeably more commercials now than before. Very disappointing.
2017-12-31 17:02:29,My experience,5,Guy513,False,Everybody is so mad about this new update but if you look at the update in a good way rather then a bad one it's not that bad. If you really take the time you understand everything again. This is my go to app for tv shows and it has some of the greatest shows ever on it. The app is fine and I still love it
2018-03-12 05:17:24,Frustrating,1,Actuality24,False,"The ads on the app are so annoying! I understand that there’s a premium for a reason, but this is ridiculous. If you have to fast forward or rewind to any part of the show you have to watch an ad, even after have already just got done watching one. I fall asleep watching shows all the time and find it absurd when there’s already 6 ads in one show, not to mention the fact that the ads are 2 minutes long and to have to repeat that just to get to a certain part of the show is a thumbs down."
2018-01-21 08:15:34,Spoiled again,1,Niclaa,False,"Oh hey! Just had the ending of a show SPOILED AGAIN because of the overly sensitive fast foward/rewind screen. Any misplaced tap on the screen and the show skips from 5 minutes into a show to 40 minutes into the show, ruining the ending for me. ANY tap above or below the pause button causes this. If I wanted to (for some stupid reason) skip 40 minutes into a show I would press the progress bar, not the upper right corner of my screen.
Making the entire screen a huge fast forward button is a completely useless feature and ruins mobile watching."
2017-12-06 05:32:22,Lineup needs an edit option,2,Lizard62481,False,"If there’s a way to edit the lineup I can’t find it. If they want to make a “suggestions” tab that’s fine but the lineup IMO should be showing what’s next in your queue. For every show I do watch there are 3 they guess I’m interested in. Let me edit it or make it a suggestion tab and put it at the end not first. The watchlist doesn’t make it easy to mark shows as watched if I’ve seen them somewhere else.  I have a show on my watchlist, why do I need to add episodes to my watchlist?"
2017-10-26 05:16:12,Inconvenient new update,2,Yum yum yeeeeee,False,"I really like the look of the new update but the new feature for rewinding is super annoying. Instead of being able to swipe just the time bar to fast forward or rewind like, you know, literally every other streaming platform, you can adjust the time bar at any part of the screen! Nobody asked for this. It makes it really inconvenient if I just tap my phone on accident.
All around it’s a well made update but the time bar feature must be acknowledged."
2017-10-28 04:35:06,Pure garbage,1,___Ron,False,"How can a 1 star rating app get an “editors choice” award?  Seriously, stop rewarding developers of an app that clearly is not in the best interest of its consumers.  The latest update is pathetic, and it’s obvious when there are literally thousands of 1 star ratings.  My biggest complaint is that 1 star is low as they go (this app is a -5 IMO).  But sadly, the truth is that we all are forced to use this pile of feces UI because it’s one of only a few major streaming services that are offered to the masses.  My advice, fire all your developers and start over.  You clearly don’t care about the user experience."
2019-06-14 00:26:20,Malia Green,5,Malia Green,False,"Great app but needs custom adds. When I am watching empire I always get these Botox adds and they are totally irrelevant. It takes the majority of the time that I have adds. Also on adds like those and other adds I’m not able to see how much time I have left until all the adds are over. 

Please fix this, Malia Green"
2017-10-05 03:15:25,It's okay,2,adriennenhc,False,"I don't love how it organizes the things I watch, but my biggest problem with it is that it frequently jumps back or forward when I touch the wrong place on the screen. I'm not sure why it's jumping or what I'm doing that makes it jump since I'm usually just trying to bring up the play button to pause. This wouldn't be that big of a deal if I could just go back to where I was, but I have to watch 90 seconds of commercials before I can fix the problem. Very annoying!"
2017-09-10 00:31:57,Please fix!,4,Mary Peña,False,"I do not like the update at all! I don like that I can't see the previous shows I watched when the new episodes come out! I have to search through my watch list and see if there's a new episode. I also don't like that when I'm on my iPad that I can't minimize the screen and do other stuff like search web, text, or scroll on social media! Please make changes ASAP!!!"
2020-10-17 02:13:36,Mixed feelings,3,imdclark24,False,"I wish I could use this app a bit more, I like it at home but to use it for on the go it’s so hard for downloads to actually download. It’s not optimized as well as the Netflix app and the downloads fail constantly. I have great internet, right next to the router, even on 4g cell data with full bars, it struggle with downloading. Everything else about the app is great but the feature I need just isn’t performing well."
2020-09-16 19:34:15,Absolutely Horrendous Chromecast connectivity,1,Swan Dadd,False,"Using this app with chromecast is always a nightmare. If I pause it even for just a moment almost without fail the app will act as if I’m not connected to Chromecast, then when trying to reconnect and resume where I left off I’m usually forced to rewatch ads as the app then restarts the episode from the beginning, and then rewatch more ads when I try to find my previous place in the episode. I accept having to watch ads, but having to constantly watch more than I have to is incredibly aggravating."
2020-04-24 23:56:35,"Great service, buggy apps",2,Cowgirl At Heart,False,"The service never has issues on my computer, but the app is constantly giving me error codes. I have closed it out completely, deleted and downloaded it again, reset my router, reset my iPad, etc. Still can only get through about one episode of anything before it times out trying to start another one. Similar problems happen with our app on the Vizio TV. I love Hulu’s selections, but they could definitely work on their apps a bit more."
2020-04-24 07:15:58,Really?,3,Ajblackhawk,False,"So I started my trial so that I could watch anime and I find that some anime’s are partially dubbed but the entire anime isn’t all dubbed? Seriously? How do you even do that? I know there are full dubs for the anime’s I was looking for so why don’t you have them? There are also movies form anime’s that you are missing and sometimes the ones you do have aren’t dubbed either!
The good thing about this app is that it has a nice playback and a good selection screen."
2019-12-20 03:00:16,?,3,Sparklera12,False,"Sooooo I was like watching Regular Show on bed right? And then something weird started happening to the show right? And I was like “Oh maybe it’s just my data” right? And then this app was talking about “Uh oh! looks like your show isn’t working right now. Please leave the app or choose a new show.” (Or whatever it said) right? Then I go to the App Store, and then it looked like it needed an update! So I click the update button, went back to my show, but it didn’t work🤷🏾‍♀️! So then I went back to the App Store after a few quick hours, then... BOOM! There was an another update! IN ONE DAY THO! And I was like “yeeeeaaaah boooooooyeeeee!!!”🥳🥳🥳🤩🤩🤩 so I pressed the update button and my show started working again! I was like “OOOOOOOOOOH!!!”🥳🥳🥳

So thank you for the update! 🤩

Truly Yours,

Norellio😃"
2019-10-14 17:56:45,Shuts down since last update,4,Vicki8201,False,"I have used this update for years without a problem. Since the last iOS update last week, I’ve begun to have issues. The app shuts down frequently, especially when rewinding and fast forwarding. It also stops working and closes when the phone is tilted. I hope this gets fixed soon!"
2019-06-23 09:05:40,This app is ok,3,Butter_.Toes,False,"I only rated this 3 stars because every five minutes there is a 80-90 second long ad! I really don’t think this is necessary for an ad every 5 freakin minutes! I know that it’s to advertise things, but every 5 minutes? That is just an extra price of coding that is not necessary. I hope in the future it would be changed, but all in all I shouldn’t complain because it gets the job done both ways."
2019-06-20 01:58:46,"Good shows, bad app",2,TheMaddestLad,False,"This app has an amazing selection of shows, but unfortunately, I've been having a lot of trouble with it. It does this thing where it only has a few episodes of a show available, even though it previously had all of the episodes, and it will say that I'm not connected to the internet when I've double and triple checked that I am. Overall, I really love the selection of shows, but it needs to fix these frustrating issues."
2019-03-20 22:22:47,Nice Streaming app,5,Cutiecupcake🧁,False,"I obviously think this app is amazing! I mean I get to watch new anime I haven’t seen, but I only ask for two things, have you heard of My Hero Academia and Sailor Moon? I just want to ask, can you add Dubs for season 3 of My Hero Academia? And For season 4 and 3 for Sailor Moon?
 That would be great, because I know Fairytail has all the season dubbed, so can you do it for both of them?"
2019-05-21 17:55:49,Don’t update!!!,2,twilikatie,False,"I use this app everyday while I’m working as I work very long shifts. Love the app and the service. But I updated the app today and now it won’t load any of my shows. When I do finally get something to play it crashes. It takes 5-10 minutes of playing around with the app, restarting my iPad (my signal strength is perfect as I’m on a big hill near cell towers) just to get one video to play only to have it crash and have to restart the process. Don’t allow it to update!!!"
2019-03-28 23:37:05,Too many ads,4,Hi Person In The Reveiws,False,The ads in my shows are constant. In every episode there are at least 4 ads all 90 seconds long. I would like it to lower down the ad rate because the ads make me get out of the mood for watching my shows and they just get really annoying. But overall the app is great I can find good shows and the. design is easy too use.
2018-06-18 05:32:51,Why is this App So Glitchy??,5,chsbandnerd2013,False,Not talking about iPhone or iPad update but the tvOS. I am not able to select videos in app. I have to use Apple's TV app to start a video. I can't skip to other episodes either. I have to wait for the credits to roll and then 30 more seconds for the timer to run out and play the next episode. PLEASE fix this!!!
2019-01-17 14:09:34,Too many taps,3,bo is ingrate,False,I finally got use to the update a while back that was so terrible. The feedback from the masses said it wasn’t friendly. And it’s NOT. The newest update has too many taps. Example watch next episode brings up more choices and to watch it in full view you have to tap 2 more times. Many other places. Please ask your users for feed back before making more changes that don’t make sense.
2019-01-02 17:01:43,Can’t use it when I need to,1,wtfthisisstupid,False,I hate this you need to refresh it on your home network every 30 days it’s absolutely ridiculous. I don’t need to use it at home I have at least 4 devices at the house with it on it but god forbid you don’t open it at least once a month; otherwise when your out and about and want to use it it’s completely useless cause you have to refresh it on your home network where you don’t need it so you don’t think about it. It should work when you pull it up regardless of how many times you use it
2018-12-28 19:01:58,Still has issues with smart tv,3,cmiller3434,False,Rating would be better except I still have issues with it not connecting right.  App works great on my tablet and phone.  But when it comes to my tv either it will say server error or check your internet connection.  I can pull up all other apps and internet on my tv with no issues.  The only solution that seems to help is unplugging my tv for about five minutes.
2018-10-21 10:13:12,Overall great,4,Sarah2950,False,"I love this app and use it all the time. It is so great that you can get current TV shows without cable. The thing that frustrates me about the app is there are several shows that I do not watch that I can’t get off “my stuff”. The box is not checked, it’s not in my watch list, yet it won’t go away. If you could fix that glitch, it would be pretty much perfect"
2018-04-02 14:12:40,Greatly disappointed,5,OnlyCere,False,"Although this app has many great shows and movies, I can’t believe they don’t allow you to view on a larger screen with the apple lightening adapter. When and if they ever update that from only audio I will definitely change my rating but I am considering canceling my subscription"
2017-09-22 18:55:34,HATE the new app version but like the subscription,5,Mark W Bishop,False,HATE HATE HATE HATE HATE HATE (cannot day it enough) the new interface. Not useful or intuitive at all. Please switch it back to what it was before and bring back the Picture in Picture feature! It’s like you removed everything I liked and replaced it all with everything I don’t!!
2018-02-19 13:27:02,Fast-forwarding and Re-winding,2,Courtney Drye,False,I was hoping that the new update would change the way you fast-forward and re-wind but it didn’t. It’s such a pain because if your in the middle of an episode and accidentally tap the screen it skips to wherever you tapped. Then not only do u have to figure out where in the episode you left off but you’ll probably have to watch a ton of commercials to get there. Not worth it. Probably deleting my subscription unless this gets changed.
2018-01-17 14:35:17,Irritating,2,Rhombiiiii,False,"There’s just one thing that really irritates me. When my hands are holding my phone, it’s very easy for the video I’m watching to skip all the way to the end because of some slide to fast forward thing. This happens too often, and it’s everything but user friendly. When I want to go back to where I last was, I have to watch a 1 min ad. Seriously?? Give me a way to turn that stupid fast forward function off. That in my opinion makes this the worst streaming app."
2017-10-01 02:34:15,Fix,1,Jaaaadooooon,False,"It's impossible to scroll through movies. I make one mistake and have to start all over. If I want to scroll alphabetically I have to manually go all the way to the end of the alphabet, instead of letter by letter (See HBO app) And idiotically, movies that start with ""The"" are all the way back in the Ts. 
Also, if I tap the screen during a movie (trying to make pause/rewind buttons go away) I end up scrolling back to the beginning of the movie.
Not saying you need to go back to old version of this app, but this definitely needs some common sense improvements."
2017-09-12 15:25:06,Live TV not quite ready,5,JoshuaJP96,False,"I tried the 7 day live TV trial and experienced an unacceptable level of connection issues for the price they are asking. Mostly used on my Apple TV with hard wired Ethernet, on a 100 mb/s connection. App is also unnecessarily difficult to navigate - too many steps involved to access just a single channel."
2018-10-21 17:30:20,Easier flow & options,5,Blades_mama,False,"I’d like it when I search a show & then click on it, if it is not available for my subscription to be able to have easier access to options of Changing my subscription, or even the availability to purchase the show."
2020-10-19 21:46:56,App is great but needs some updates,3,Biirdx,False,Love the app use it on my tv with no problems but every time i use the app on my iphone it just doesn’t play a live show at all and thats super annoying. It will play 2 seconds of an ad then stop playing a buffer for 20 minutes go back to the program and play for 2 minutes before it pauses and buffers for another 20 or even longer amount of time. So annoying.
2020-06-14 12:30:52,This needs a fix quick,1,Glarrrrrrb!!!!!!,False,"Can you make it so when you change the volume it doesn’t have that big box show up and instead has a small bar at the top of the screen like Netflix. It gets to the point where I just don’t wanna use the app because I change the volume around and I don’t want a big box in the middle of my screen. 
Edit: and now there’s a glitch where when I click the button to go into full screen it will do the little flash thingy but it won’t go into full screen. This app is so broken."
2020-05-30 17:55:36,Languages,3,DeeRogersssss,False,I give it three because it’s a really good app and it has a really good variety of shows and movies but my problem is languages there are a few shows that I really enjoy watching but it is originally a Japanese version and I go to change the language on the fourth season and for some reason it won’t let me change the language for English I really hope that this can be changed especially for.  My Hero Acadamia
2020-03-17 07:26:05,Please fix the App,3,Victorn7212001,False,It’s a good app and I’m happy paying for it but my issue is that I have to close and re open the app Avery now and then because it freezes and then tells me I have to refresh even though the internet is fine. Everything goes back to normal after I close and reopen but the. It starts all over again. Hoping it’ll get fixed. If I’m paying for an app I at Least want it to function properly.
2020-03-12 17:01:01,"Good shows, poor quality app",2,AWE1102,False,"Watching more than two episodes in a row it completely stops working and I have to close the app and restart. You also can’t manage your account or change ANYTHING on the app. It make supi go to the website and the whole thing is simply inconvenient. Not to mention it’s way more expensive than Netflix. I only have it For Brooklyn 99, and Archer. Literally to do anything on the app it takes five more steps than it does others."
2020-02-28 06:08:29,Needs improvement,3,Candilox,False,"The platform feels less intuitive, the commercials are always louder than the show and there are to many commercial breaks.  Also off putting that the only option to upgrade the account is to delete/cancel and start over, really agitated that it’s so convoluted trying to give you more of my money.  I do like the content and originals but the app feels like a hassle to often."
2020-01-05 02:31:13,To many...,4,litzars,False,I think app is great I really don’t have many issues with this app at all the only thing I really dislike is is that there are to many ads when u first watch the beginning 95% out of 100% will there be an ad throughout the show u am watching 4-7 ads play each episode over all I think that is good but they should really fix that
2019-10-06 00:44:06,Buggy. Needs a lot of work.,1,Jusstaylor,False,"Doesn’t resume to current episodes, only the last episode you watched. So if you started on season 3 episode 3 but allowed the divorce to continue playing till you pause the show, you could on episode 7 but the divorce still reflects episode 3. So you are stuck rewatching if you don’t actually remember. Also interfere all the time when streaming even when WiFi signal is strong. I stop using the service over the years do to this same issue, may have to disconnect again. Very exhausting."
2019-06-01 00:44:24,Playback error no help from customer service,1,Sweetz9510,False,"DO NOT UPDATE THE APP! I’ve been having playback issue ever since I updated to the 5.48.1 update last week (week ending 5/25). Thought customer service today, 5/31, would be able to assist me after troubleshooting the issues on my own days before. Absolutely no help at all! The rep was nice but the advice they offer was stiff I already tried days before. Absolutely ridiculous and annoying! It even went up to the “higher ups” and they told the rep to tell me to try the. same. stuff. I. already. tried!"
2019-02-08 16:58:48,Download and watch offline,4,Baaalugaaa,False,"This feature was supposed to be “coming shortly” a long time ago. Now it doesn’t seem to be coming at all. Every other video app has it for iPhone. It’s a big reason why I use any other app over yours if they have the same show, and why if I had to drop one viewing app it would be yours.

Otherwise you’re doing fine."
2019-01-24 16:09:23,?,4,SharonK100,False,I like not missing my TV show. I just watch them the next day. I don’t like when you pick a show the next screen gives you episode choices and when you pick the next episode the next screen has it in a small box that you have to make bigger. Why doesn’t it come up full screen since you already made your choice?
2018-09-19 08:50:27,Best TV streaming subscription service,5,Nardwuar Sr.,False,"Best shows from all of the big networks available in HD, what more could you want. Just wish you could have it streaming on more devices at the same time considering the price per month. Split between three people it is a no brained it is so cheap. Less than a cup of coffee per week."
2018-10-01 21:40:31,Too much commercials and you can’t rewind without watching commercials again,1,koolday67,False,The amount of commercials you have to watch throughout the episode is ridiculous. Especially when you accidentally rewind and have to watch the same commercials again. Maybe you should fix it so once you watch a commercial mark so can actually rewind the show and not sit through the commercials all over again. If you want to keep customers it’s probably a good idea to listen to all the reviews saying the commercials are too much.
2018-09-29 03:27:11,Needs work,2,Allie2468,False,"The app is very glitchy. I am constantly having to slide the episode back to where I was watching it, because it will jump, while I am watching it. 
Also,This is now the 3rd time the app won’t even open properly, and stays on the loading screen. I know this isn’t a WiFi issue, because I tested my WiFi and the strength is excellent. Plus, my other apps were working. 
It’s frustrating to pay for a service I can’t use. Hopefully, the issue is corrected soon."
2018-01-28 01:05:55,can’t watch videos successfully with the new update on my iPad mini or iPhone 7,5,Shalindria,False,"Commercials cause glitches

Also, you can’t jump back or forward 10 seconds without the audio not matching up with the video. Sometimes it even repeats itself like I’m in the frickin matrix or something 

I am so frustrated! 😡"
2018-05-16 18:39:07,Update isn’t helpful,1,Blondieluvsyu,False,"Any time I have to refresh the page to continue watching it plays the commercials first. Then I refresh and it replays the commercials. 
The interactive commercials were a terrible idea, terrible TERRIBLE. it’s a cool concept but I’m paying for a service to watch content not to be bugged with having to touch the screen every single commercial break. just to choose whether or not I want no participate in the interactive commercial requires that I stop what I’m doing to choose one so either way you’re interrupting my viewing experience."
2018-05-03 03:27:48,Horrible the past few days,1,No longer a fan 12345,False,"I have only had this app for maybe a month or so and I really liked it at first but the last few days it's been horrible. I've used it in different places with different wifi and it's the same thing. Buffer restart, play a little, buffer restart, jumps back, buffer, etc. this is seriously every 2 seconds. And reaching out to support was not useful at all. My internet speed is not the issue. All other apps work great. I hope they fix whatever this problem is or I will cancel and stick with Netflix only"
2018-03-26 04:46:37,The user interface is a nightmare,1,jbenbeasley,False,"There are probably thirty things wrong with this app’s user experience, but the two currently haunting me the most are:

1. Autoplay won’t play the next consecutive episode if you are watching a past season, it keeps jumping to current episodes
2. The fast forward and rewind feature is punitive and awful. Besides accidentally triggering it all the time, it immediately skips to where your finger is relative to the width of you screen, instead of rewinding or fast forwarding from where you currently are in the how. Ridiculous."
2017-10-11 22:03:12,Hate the mobile app!,5,5inthecoop,False,"Why change something that already (sort of) works!! My phone and tv no longer have the same shows. I can’t delete anything from my tv, I used to do it from my phone. Well HALF of the shows in my profile on my tv don’t even show up on the mobile version! HATE IT!!
Update: KEEPS GETTING WORSE!!"
2018-01-19 03:29:02,Fix subtitles please,4,Tanmandan,False,"In the latest version some bug won’t allow me to turn subtitles on. It’s grayed out with the on selection selected. It says go to accessibility and settings, so I do and turn subtitles on there. Still no subtitles. Please fix this in the next update ASAP because I can’t watch anime (Boruto in this instance) without subtitles. I’ve tried turning off and on, even updating to the latest iOS."
2017-11-12 20:37:38,Don’t have much control,2,current Hulu user,False,"You get little control over recorded shows or sports. If you have a team as a favorite it doesn’t allow you to watch a game live in the middle of the game. You can’t fast forward quickly. And then there’s the skipping, pausing, and glitches. It will at random times bounce back 2 mins to 15 mins. You are forced to watch it again. Makes watching live tv unenjoyable. I give it 2 stars because it is cheaper than cable/satellite. When it works it is worth it."
2017-10-17 06:49:15,...,2,Sparkly vampire,False,"All I wanna do is watch my show which I'm btw paying $11 a month for or upwards of $100 a year and every time I click a video it says error won't load try reloading episode or try again later the point of updates is to fix things not create problems I don't even like writing this review or badmouthing apps but other reviewers and my own review make a fair point.  it's making me re evaluate paying for this. As soon as I updated this happened, it was fine before. Dissatisfied.

2017-09-16 18:14:29,Hard to find my shows,1,Typical Gunner,False,"This update was horrible when I'm trying to find the shows I normally watch I have to dig around on the updated app. The old version I could find it real easy now I have to go through all the shows you want me to watch which I don't even want to watch or even care to watch. This updated version looks like you guys took two steps back instead of moving forward trying to make the App look trendy is not the way to do it please fix it
I would really like to give you zero stars for this update"
2020-08-12 23:31:27,Worst app,1,No name on here,False,So many glitches. Sometimes the title of the episode will not match the description (they would be mixed up with the previous episode). Sometimes the next episode will not automatically play due to an “error” which requires me to restart the app. Sometimes it will this same “error” in the MIDDLE of a show. Sometimes the audio will be working but the screen will be blank. And almost every time... it will not save the place where you left off... it’s SO INACCURATE. I HATE THIS APP. I have to restart the app at least 10 times a day.
2020-07-18 02:01:24,Too many bugs,2,fhsixhdb,False,"When you watch shows on this app you will experience lots of bugs that make it very tedious to use the app. For example, if I finish an episode of a show and want to watch the next one, It will sometimes start playing the next episode’s audio, but the video is a still picture, I then have to completely close the app and relaunch it. This app would be 5 stars, but there are WAY too many bugs for me to recommend it to anyone."
2020-06-24 17:44:08,Used to work...,3,cgreen16736,False,"The app used to work fine. I could tap it and it would open. I now tap it and nothing happens. I’ve deleted the app repeatedly and redownloaded it, I constantly power cycle to get it to open and that’s just in my phone. On the fire stick, it is just closing mid show. We have the latest version of the app and fire stick, as well as fast internet/data and I have an iPhone 11. 

I’m guessing it’s not me, but you..."
2020-03-21 02:22:48,Amazin’!,4,Neurosurgeon Wick,False,"I love the app and lets me watch all my favourite shows like live pd, nightwatch nation, behind bars rookie year and so much more. I hope that you will stop taking shows off and scheduling to show it at a later date. I was in the middle of a movie and the next day I could not watch it because it was to be broadcasted at a later date. If you could fix this then it is golden."
2020-02-28 08:57:25,The Ads update,1,sgtaverywade22,False,"I understand the need for ads and to make money but you get paid monthly just for people wanting to watch off of your app i don't understand the excess of ads i just want to watch a show without haveing to see 4 different ad breaks not to mention most the time its the same adam and eve commercial its sad to see a good site gone to waste, its really hard to stay connected to a good show because of all the ads i just wanna feel the emotions in the show and then boom another ad appears would rate lower if i could"
2020-02-11 05:08:11,"Great content, rough quality",3,PainfulNicknameProcess,False,"The selection of content is as predictably great as the companies that have bought a piece of the application. Honestly, you can find most of you want and it’s great, except the quality barley crawls over 720p.

We have a 4K Apple TV with a direct Ethernet connection to our 100mbps cable line, and it’s still massively pixelated.

So I guess it’s cool but they won’t bring the heat when it comes to seeing what your looking at it."
2020-02-10 02:27:04,Review,4,Johnfrank Imp,False,I love this app but sometimes when I’m watching a show for a long period of time (binging) the adds get to be very much adding to the overall time it takes to watch something take My Hero Academia for example great show with a lot of detail and I’m glad it’s on there but there are about  four one and a half minute adds that really distract from the show qualities
2019-06-18 03:23:45,3rd or 4th time reviewing,3,Drwatson90,False,"It seems that every time I turn around, I’m re writing this review. The content is great but the app is so buggy. When you try to watch something, it sits and loads forever then times out. I have to restart the app a few times to get it to work. Then when it’s time for next episode, it errors out and you have to do it all over again. Looking forward to re writing this in a month."
2019-03-19 16:49:01,Episodes Almost Never Marked As Watched,3,mitsuhoney,False,"Consistently having issues with episodes never showing as being watched or seasons being caught up, I don’t know how many times there’s been an update that never solves this completely frustrating problem. On top of that, there’s always connectivity issues when watching shows and I have to constantly reload the page 2-3 times."
2018-12-22 03:05:29,can’t watch one full episode,4,Mbish,False,"i would really appreciate if you all would fix this new bug that doesn’t allow me to watch a full episode without closing it like 10 times for it to load. i know it is not my internet because multiple people are experiencing the same thing. I really want to watch Marvel’s Runaways so fix this ASAP, please."
2018-08-24 07:01:18,Phone to the tv,5,Gio_777,False,I haven’t use it for while now but I would have a problem when I would use my phone to watch a movie or a show on the tv I would have my phone connected with Cable core to the TV i would be able to hear the sound of but it wouldn’t show no picture on my tv
2018-08-17 21:28:37,Broken,5,LAS28093,False,"Cannot even sign into the app on Ipad or iphone while connected to WiFi.  Not an issue when connected to Cellular - very odd??  Have deleted and reinstalled the app multiple times, shut down and restarted both devices, and reset the modem/router to no avail.  Please fix this as it is very frustrating."
2018-08-21 01:06:02,Ads AND Payments?,4,BougiePride,False,"$10 for a month of ad packed television is not the greatest. Considering there is an ad every 7-9 minutes, I think that 90 seconds is a long time. It may be that I’m inpatient, or the “ lack of income” it seems they have to place so many ads. 10 usd from how many people that have this application is a lot of money and the ads are annoying and obnoxious."
2018-02-23 06:35:46,Beautiful design,5,Alaric River.,False,"I feel like I should leave a review.. because I have no idea why people are complaining about the new design when the old one was a nightmare and outdated. Have not had any navigation problems and the new design is really beautiful. Also, thank you for picture in picture. Wow at these reviews."
2018-05-31 20:21:08,Review,3,Mr.Middleclass,False,"Honestly I really don’t mind the commercials that much. Although, having the same commercials playing is annoying. My real issue is when I'm streaming on my phone, the screen cuts to black and the video is still playing. Its not my phone screen dimming because I haven’t touched the screen or being in power save mode. It happens regardless if my phone is in regular battery usage mode or not. Iphone 7 here as well."
2018-05-08 03:01:23,Crashes Constantly/Latest Update BLOWS,1,Misslaniebrenae,False,"I echo the complaints of everyone else - the fast forward/pause play/screen issues are sabotaging viewing experience. In addition (or subtraction as it were), since the latest update? App crashes constantly or freezes my whole iPad and I have to restart! That’s some blast-from-the-past problems right there. seriously your competitors have figured it out, get yourselves together it’s embarrassing. Original content doesn’t mean anything if your viewers can’t get through a whole episode!"
2018-04-29 04:56:20,Newest update,4,C12?,False,This new update has been much better with the pausing skipping issue. The only problem I’ve noticed thus far is the back button “<“ in the top left corner is nearly covered by the play next button so either I have to turn off auto play or start the next episode to go back. Not much of a deal breaker but rather annoying.
2017-10-10 21:18:20,Fast-forward Feature,5,Stop.don't.do.it,False,Bring back the fast-forward dot or button on the bottom of the screen.  I don’t like the sliding anywhere on the screen it’s annoying when you accidentally touch the screen and it Rewind or fast-forward to wherever you touch the screen.
2017-12-13 06:01:50,Please remove the rewind feature!,2,Torimonsterx,False,"Show and movie selections are great but too many ads. I watch a lot of anime and having 6 ads on a 20-25min show is a bit much. The feature where you tap to rewind is literally driving me crazy. There have been countless times when I've picked up my iPad to move it, accidentally fast-forwarding to the end and having to wait for the ad to finish before I'm able to movie it back (and then sometimes having to watch another ad). Please REMOVE."
2017-12-07 03:35:36,Worst control center ever,1,Hdhjdid,False,I hate this setup. I’m just trying to go to the episodes of a show and it give me two options; go to more info or the series details. Like what? What is series detail. I click on that then there are like two more steps to go to the episodes spot. Also when ever you are watching something if you are trying to go back to the main page you might as well close and restart the app because I guarantee you will end up clicking something else. Netflix is on such a superior level it isn’t even funny.
2017-11-03 19:57:14,Cancel/Get Netflix!!! Can't even use the app!!!,1,Queen bands,False,If you don't have brand new devices! Don't bother even signing up! This is truly robbery! They don't ask you what type of device you have or even let you know that the app is not compatible with all devices! I can use freaking Netflix on a PS3 still! It's ridiculous that they even accept your money... Knowing that they need to fix they're app! Also all they said was yeah we know it has to be updated! I'm sure I am not the first to call about this issue! I canceled my subscription to say the least! #FUCKHULU!!!
2017-11-03 00:18:45,Clear Watch History/Keep Watching,4,rhinobone10,False,"I think the app is pretty ok, except for one major problem. There’s no way to clear your watch history (that I know of.) It’s very annoying because my keep watching category is just filled with movies that I started but I didn’t finish because I didn’t like them. Please add someway to clear history through the app!"
2020-09-11 14:30:38,It was fun while it lasted,5,givesfeedbackalot,False,I can’t watch on mobile anymore because every time I click on a show or movie to watch it doesn’t play instead your click and clicking and it still doesn’t work! Please fix this ASAP and I’ll change my review back to a 5 star rating!
2020-09-18 15:14:34,Needs a lot of work,2,Honeynutcherrios,False,"The app has too many bugs, glitches and annoying actions. Many seem like they would be easy fixes, but no they don't care.
When watching a show, sometimes it wont go to the next episode, instead it will play a random new one.
When trying to resume watching something, sometimes it will restart episode from the beginning.
If trying to find a movie or show you were watching sometimes it wont show up anywhere on your ""continue watching"".
When making multiple profiles, some users will not be able to find theirs, and will be let in to another profile that is not theirs.
If you have the version with ads, forget about rewinding or fast forwarding because it wont let you until you watch all the ads."
2019-08-26 16:37:01,LOVE LIVE,4,Mommaashley2016,False,"Loving the live tv option! Just wish the guide for live tv was more like cable tv with being able to see what’s playing in the future. Also a better live tv demand option. There’s lots of shows I like to watch, but they air when I’m sleeping. But it’s hard to record those shows when I can’t go further in the guide, or find it in an on demand menu."
2020-07-25 01:24:20,App needs work,1,49714961,False,"You guys need to fix the buffering when uploading the videos and when watching an episode and when the next one begins? It either goes back to the home page or I have to close the app and then open it back up and then go to series details and then pick the next episode! Very frustrating! For a paying subscription this issue needs to be fix! It’s not my service, everything else works fine except your format! Fix it or ya going to lose not just me but many customers"
2020-06-06 01:15:44,Needs fixing,3,Lubel909,False,I can’t even get to watch one show.... I was looking forward to watching some things I haven’t been able to cause I could only find on here and I can’t even get started. Checked the WiFi multiple times and nothing. I’ve switch from WiFi to my phone data and nothing reinstall the app and nothing... I hope this can be fixed before I regret my choice of getting the plan
2020-04-21 03:53:05,Good shows But Missing Episodes,2,1234567890gabby,False,"Many of the great shows provided have missing episodes which make enjoying this platform very irritable and something needs to be done about this, if your not going to have all episodes of a show then don’t put it on your platform, simple as that. Disappointed and Unsatisfied. Also sometimes the advertisements are ridiculous, you can pay a lower price for a simple subscription on Netflix and get no ads."
2019-10-28 17:34:58,It gets annoying,3,JaniceC:,False,I’m fine with the ads since it’s the cheapest version but I would appreciate it if it actually saved the spot I stopped at like Netflix does. Every time I go back to the app I have to scroll through the episode and rewatch the same ads before just to get to my spot. Also can we get more variety in the ads 😂 I get the same ads five times in one episode and it gets annoying
2019-10-07 23:31:25,Terrible platform,1,otsxbjy,False,Every time I go to continue a series it’s always 3 episodes back from where I left off. There’s no easy way to get into Episodes and seasons making it more difficult to find the episode where you left off and that’s if I use the same device! I can’t imagine if I hoped from my laptop to my tv what would happen. Who pays for this crap with commercials on top of it. I came here for Letterkenny and I’m leaving after two weeks... it’s too much of a headache. I bought all 6 seasons... worth every penny not to use this.
2019-08-14 04:40:50,I can’t sign in,5,Tiffanyrose2007,False,"App works on my Apple TV not my iPhone.

Update: I figured it out. I had to give my phone permission to use cellular data to use the app. Suggestion/ it would be helpful for a pop up to show the option of turning on cellular data for this app if it is turned off and no WiFi is connected."
2018-08-28 03:21:46,Quality tv,5,Theworsta ppever,False,"For $13 a month I get pretty much all the good shows that are out right now and forever ago, but without the commercials. Compared to paying for sat/cable where commercial breaks can last up to 5 min. that's a steal. Also the layout format is sleek and I enjoy launching the app and navigating through it"
2019-04-20 20:47:45,"Great service, sports are a bit lagged",4,badger actuary,False,"I text with my family a lot during sporting events and they are usually 30 seconds to a minute ahead of me. Also, my brother lives in Dayton, but would prefer to get the Milwaukee channels. That seems like something that should be an option. Otherwise I love it, way better than any cable service I’ve had"
2019-04-07 03:32:31,You can do better than this,1,DOS486,False,"Why is it that when I’m watching something on iPad and I swipe up then the show keeps playing but the video doesn’t show anywhere. 

Also I just finished watching an episode of something and I press the close button and I went back and I tapped on a different series to start watching and now I have two videos one playing in the background and playing commercials and the other one in the foreground playing commercials this is ridiculous you can do better."
2019-01-18 06:26:51,Bring old version back,2,Lwood72,False,"I hate the new version of this app! It’s so not user friendly, I have nothing to show me when there’s new episodes of the shows I watch, unless I go digging. I miss being able to see clearly first thing when I open the app shows I watch and what has a new episode. I struggle to find anything and my child can’t use it at all anymore without me fully setting up which is also quite frustrating. Please bring back a simpler version!!"
2018-12-18 01:46:43,Unwatchable due to excessive adds,1,bleeding internaly,False,"Seriously what you guys need is to have Corp. America be more involved in your application....
I mean there’s just not enough adds...every 4 minutes is t good enough you should make it every 3!!! Why not....he’ll you’ve already duped us into buying the app thinking we could actually watch the programming on it without being interrupted excessively!!!! I’m scared for my children... I mean seriously is it going to be normal in the future to have to watch an hour of propaganda just to have 15 minutes of real viewing time Jesus...RIDICULOUS!"
2018-09-27 04:40:13,Great app,4,JazKerns,False,It has a good amount of shows and I love how it *usually* has shows that Netflix doesn’t. I don’t like that you can’t access your account through the app though since my phone is my only source of internet mostly. I can access their website obviously but it would be a lot more convenient since I have their app downloaded anyway.
2018-09-04 01:10:44,Love hate. But lots of hate,2,YepIYelp,False,"So happy to have live tv without cable. But this app drives me nuts. Stop switching stuff every time i use it. Something i watched the past two days is now impossible to find. But the repeat skipping - that i can find. Easily

I will stick with it for a bit. But it is a frustrating journey. And god forbid you want to use the app outside your house - dont even try. It requires a sync, a dance, and a letter from jesus to use this on a business trip or just 5 ft too far from your wifi"
2018-08-31 08:02:46,Premier league  and NBCSN don’t show in Sports,2,RobScoti,False,"3 big beefs. 
1. Premier league is soccer and should show in soccer category 2. Seems like overall NBCSN is not even coming up in sports or listing future events at all. 
3. Why is the Guide only showing exactly 24 hours ahead. Why not next day or next week. Other TV providers offer at least a week. I need this to set recordings for the upcoming week when I will be away.

Not yet at all usable as a replacement for my cable TV provider. Same comments go for Apple TV and iPad app"
2018-04-05 18:17:27,Can I give this zero stars,5,bohobeautifullife,False,Thought I was crazy for hating this app but turns out most people do. 80 seconds of commercials every like 3-5 mins.... and half the time it glitches so bad that it makes you watch like 20 commercials. Not worth it. They take your money and provide crap service . Just buy Netflix
2018-08-24 01:47:40,Crashing,1,DarkCheeseDriver,False,"App keeps crashing after finishing episodes saying that there is no internet connection please try again later. This will also happen if I open another app or answer a text message and go back into the show I was watching. It’s all shows, at all times of the day or night, with apps open and closed. There is no pattern on what might be causing this issue other than a bug within the programming itself. The only positive thing about this crashing is that it motivates me to stop watching faster."
2018-07-17 15:42:37,"Semi functional, stupid changes from previous versions",3,dandyb89,False,"Why when I watch this on my iPad does the video stay small and pull up other things to watch along the side? When I push resume, I want to watch that show in full screen, not get suggestions of other shows. In fact, the whole new look of the update made the entire app less functional. So much harder to navigate or browse."
2018-04-19 11:12:13,Subtitles,4,Duecel,False,I don’t have any problems streaming. My main problem is that the subtitles won’t display after a certain time. It will go out until you select the option again. Then it will do it again. You have to “reset it” multiple times during shows. It’s a little frustrating but not the end of the world.
2017-11-05 04:50:02,THE BEST APP.,5,Jewels1637,False,"HULA is great. When I saw the reviews I was shocked. I have only watched the t.v. Series, have not gotten to the movies yet. But I have had absolutely no problem with this app at all. 
Hula has everything on t.v. Shows and when I say Everything, I mean it!! I love the old shows and new shows. I asked my husband to pick a show and he did ( one I never heard of ) and the show was on the app.  
I have watched the show on my iPhone 7 Plus and on my t.v. as well and have had no lagging, stopping, or anything.. I have to say I would recommend this app to Everyone!! You should definitely try it. You have nothing to lose if you try it Free for a month.

2018-03-07 09:08:45,Glitches a lot,3,R.E.L.,False,"It seems to have a lot of bugs. Kicks you out a lot, glitches tons, doesn’t go to the page you clicked on sometimes. Though I think the shows and movie choices are better than netflix. Unfortunately you over pay for extra streaming. You have to buy a couple packages before you are offered extra streaming... it’s a toss up. I have a feeling I wont be using it long."
2018-02-24 06:21:20,Could be way better,1,dickie3417,False,Need an option to restart a partially watched episode of a show. I watch shows and am all caught up with a series but it will say there’s 5 min left in most recent episode and that I’m not caught up. Annoying quirks/bugs with app. Takes too many clicks to go back to the main screen when done watching a show. Was trying to watch a NFL game and started 45 min after game actually started but the app kept starting at beginning of broadcast instead of live even tho it said it was at the live part.
2018-02-03 03:23:26,What the what,1,Snookumhookum,False,"Guys, I’ve loaded the app 3 times tonight I cannot get past the start screen. I’m frustrated, this is the very reason I’ve canceled service twice before. I hotspot for internet service on my roku it was working fine then. I use my phone most often to save my hotspot time and I CANT use the app.  I love the service even with the repeat ads that are slightly annoying, but if I can’t get it to work I’ll just suspend the service and use Netflix until you figure it out. I came back based on your info the app was updated. Not cool not cool at all."
2018-01-25 01:45:57,Unreliable with virtually non existent tech support,1,keV2001,False,"You can believe the ratings. For such a big company they offer almost no tech support when things don't work which is often. Only Comcast is worst in my experience. Call in and they always have "" normal than usual call volume"" and it hangs up on you. No email reply. Classic example of a company that sells a service but doesn't invest in support to make sure it works. No wonder people stream stuff illegally, as appears easier and more reliable from what other people have shown me."

Yes please. Log in works, thank god! Would you like to upgrade your account? 1. How you won't let me make an account. 2. I'm trying to get the no add option, how could I possibly upgrade.

I haven't been able to actually play video in it in three updates which is funny because your freaking ads work just fine. Video just goes to a black screen with sound after the ads okay. Absolute waste off money. You guys basically have until the end of this week to fix it or I'm cancelling. Frankly, I want a refund for the two months that is hasn't worked too but that will never happen. Even the CBS app isn't this bad."
2017-10-28 01:22:45,The new update,5,Mstahitisweei,False,"This app hasn’t worked properly for me since the new update. Every single time I try to play I video, it gives me an error message. I’ll try deleting and reinstalling the app but after several phone resets, nothing’s changed. The older version of the app was much more user friendly."
2017-10-12 19:55:21,New Update = App doesn't work,5,Pharaoh Reigns,False,"Every since the latest update, which changed the entire look of the iPhone app, no show or movie will play via the iPhone app. The iPhone app will open, I can see and read info about my shows and episodes but when I click play they won't. Please fix thanks"
2020-05-02 16:40:28,Not worth it,5,@Danny_Galdamez,False,I bought this and there were some good shows but it really doesn’t make sense that I have to pay and can’t even watch all the movies came here wanting to watch the man with no name movies but I have to pay even more to watch it and lots of other tv shows and movies
2017-10-11 01:50:28,New Interface is Slow to Navigate,1,Mr. J. Skellington,False,"The new interface is terrible. One of the nice things about on-demand streaming services is the ability to browse to find new content. The only way to browse on this app is to swipe through every<swipe>individual<swipe>show<swipe>. The classic UI concept of ""max three clicks to get anywhere"" is dead. This looks and acts like an early Windows 8 app - so over simplified that it is useless.

As my primary interface is with the mobile app (streaming to a Chromecast), if this isn't fixed, I'll cancel my service."
2017-10-10 03:14:55,HATE the update,1,cherishedart,False,Canceling subscription now because I HATE the update.  It was so simple before and now the kids can not even navigate their way around!  What a WASTE OF TIME scrolling through each show individually! And the number of times the show skips all over the place bc of accidentally touching the screen ANYWHERE. Look at Hulu’s 1 star rating now. WE DO NOT LIKE ANYTHING ABOUT THE NEW UPDATE! And now there is no option to erase user history in the app. You have to go on the computer. Now wireless headphones can no longer pause and un-pause the show! Touch screen only!  DESERVES ZERO STARS!!!!
2017-10-10 01:38:52,Terrible,1,Tomixrider,False,"Can't tell you how many times I ""accidentally"" touched a wrong part of the screen and it took me back/forward so I had to watch commercials until I could go back to where I was. It's too sensitive. Also really hard to find what I'm looking for. You have to scroll so much to get to where you want to go. And ""Play next episode"" page doesn't really work. I would click on the next episode and it wouldn't go there. You just wait it out and it plays the same episode you just watched. Over all, a terrible update."
2017-09-22 05:20:47,Horrible GUI and Service is Worse,1,Keegster1,False,"I applied the updates and it only got worse from there... versions 5.6.0 and 5.6.1 have made it very difficult to navigate, it takes much longer to find a favorite show or something new to watch. 
The app also no longer supports HDMI mirroring Apple's lightening to HDMI adapter. I will be canceling my subscription  pending HULU's response regarding support ongoing support for HDMI mirroring. If you are not already a subscriber I recommend you wait to sign up until reviews reflect a fix has been made or putting your subscription on hold."
2017-09-10 23:52:58,What have you done?,4,PositiveFeed,False,What you've done with the new update is terrible. Why change something that is not broken. Give change to the costumer in small bite sizes not throw them completely into a banquet of chaos.  It is confusing and having to get acquainted with a whole new look takes more time that enjoying the shows we/I like to watch. 👎
2020-09-11 14:13:33,Still broken: updated,4,DjWysh,False,"I used to love the app but the newest update still doesn’t fix it so I can tap on the shows and it still doesn’t play. Again the point of a streaming app is to stream anything and it’s still useless at doing just that.
Update: mysteriously started working again just last night. I can stream again!"
2020-05-31 03:41:13,💆🏽‍♀️,3,show critic/lover,False,"I would’ve gave it 5 stars but, there is to many ads and the ads are way too long so I had to deduct at least two stars. Honestly it’s unbearable, if your gonna put a bunch of ads at least not make them so painfully long. Other than that there is a very good collection and variety of shows. Good collection of shows and long ads aside, would i recommend buying? If you can bare 2+ minute ads yes."
2020-04-18 15:38:31,Auto play is messed up!,5,hdyjcjdvng,False,I’m watching a show and instead of logically moving on to the next episode in the series it jumps to a completely different show i’ve never even watched before. How Frustrating! Watching “Miss America” would not mean I want to watch “Legion” after the episode ends.
2020-04-28 09:39:43,App Problems,1,jdboling,False,"Constantly having problems opening the app, back in January-February, i couldn’t open the app because of a error that would happen, yet on my tv i could open it, and i would constantly check for any new updates and reinstall but nothing worked, and now in April, and i’m sure for May, the app won’t even open, i press on it to launch the app, and it starts then immediately closes out to my home screen, this is very annoying, and seems to not be a issue my end, so i’d like to see it get addressed."
2018-12-13 02:03:12,Good but...,4,I like rewards aka NinjaNina,False,I like it for the choices of shows and all but the ads every few minutes isn’t very nice. I know you can pay to remove them but I don’t think that very good because you already are paying for a membership. At least lower the time of the adds from 2 minutes to 1 that would be 50 millions times better.
2020-04-11 15:57:04,"Great shows, horrible bugs",3,Weirdstarfish_101,False,"This app has a great variety of shows, i prefer it over Netflix, HOWEVER the only issue i have is the unbearable GLITCHES! At first it would close out of an episode and back to the season menu sporadically, now after about 3-30 seconds after clicking on an episode the app IMMEDIATELY crashes! It’s so annoying! I have a paid subscription, yet I can’t watch anything! This is so unprofessional."
2020-02-18 00:08:57,AUTOPLAY,2,Adrie96,False,"Please fix the autoplay function idk what happened but it doesn’t work anymore so between each ep I have to physically press play. Also the recommendations need to be fixed, if I say stop suggestion a month later it shouldn’t suggest the same show. It may not seem like much but it’s super annoying and it feels like they’re trying to bombard us with shows they have on their platform to make it seem like there’s always something new or constantly updated."
2019-11-27 06:10:58,"Ads, ads and more ads",2,Gjvrhbcg,False,"Too many ads. Every 3-8 minutes theres 90 seconds worth of ads and it’s hard to enjoy a show with interruptions. A lot of interruptions. Its ridiculous and of course it’s your business’ way of earning the money every company needs, but this isn’t how you are supposed to earn it. You are losing users and one of them is me. It’s really hard to focus and get into the show if you’re literally not even able to watch it."
2019-08-13 19:11:10,Who does your UX/UI?,1,PasiakaZ,False,"It’s like the UX/UI people don’t know what intuitive, user-friendly experience looks like. Who puts play-rewind-forward buttons within literally millimeters from each other? How is that a good experience? And then I can’t pause by clicking anywhere on the screen - no, I have to use all my sniper skills to aim at one of those minuscule buttons to press the right buttons. Absolutely ridiculous. Oh yeah, and the dashboard? You should test your dashboard on actual people and see how intuitive that ridiculous interface is."
2019-06-19 01:53:10,Poor support,2,Jvandegr,False,"The apps like to say that there must be a connection issue on your end, but really it will work on 2 of 3 devices and is most likely a app bug they don’t care to fix. One week it will be your tv, the next your iPad. They point you to their help center where they basically tell you to turn off your device and turn it back on... super frustrating. I like the live tv service but I’m going to switch over this run around and zero tech support."
2019-04-23 16:48:56,Works great! At least one tweak needs to be addressed.,3,With a capital M,False,"The app works great. It plays my videos without any difficulties. However there is one issue that I think needs to address. The function that removes a show from “my stuff”. For instance, there is this anime series that I want to remove. But no matter how many times I hit remove on either my iOS devices or my PCs, it keeps returning to the “my stuff” list. It is getting annoying!"
2018-11-27 21:52:16,Promotion failed,1,CO Chic,False,"Tried to sign up for the promotion they had just after Thanksgiving. .99/month for 1 year. Wow great deal! But website would not load. I actually fell asleep while waiting for it to hopefully start working. Woke up went to work, got off work to call them and since I didn’t call them before 10am EST I don’t get the promotion deal. BUT I could sign up for 5.99/month with limited commercials. Lol! No thanks. You’re site should have been working and to only extend the offer for a short amount of time! Some of us have to work..."
2019-04-19 16:39:08,THIS IS THE BEST,5,unicornlover🦄💜,False,I love this because u r able to wach things that were only on tv but no you can find on this app and you can also watch shows that used to be on Netflix that aren’t anymore I spend most of my time on this app I love it so much and I never one out of fun shows to watch I love this so much 💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜
2018-10-26 01:15:04,Decide for yourself,3,Charlcec,False,"You pay for it, but you still have to watch commercials. Yeah there’s an almost commercial free higher tier for a few dollars more, but you need to decide if that’s worth it. Their stream is unreliable for me, while my other services (Netflix, HBO) deliver perfect streams. But I get to watch old stuff and check out current shows from studios that probably don’t deserve my attention. So there’s that. Is it worth it? Up to you."
2018-01-18 07:19:25,I hate the new “experience “,1,zcherries,True,"It take more taps, more swipes, more time to find the content I’m trying to watch. How about a quick link to start watching what you were the last time you left the app? I want to see multiple options on my screen that I can scroll around with, like before. This is particularly bad on my iPad. What a waste of a giant 12” screen! Seriously?! Only show one show at a time? STUPID!

And why does it take SO LONG TO LOAD!

Also I don't like the rw/ff overlay. Its way too dark compared to the content and takes too long to go away."
2017-12-12 05:25:35,Where’d My List Go?!?!,1,AshMBC8709,False,"Since the new app update on my iPad, the platform has gotten terrible to use. I have a number of items added to my list for easy access, but when I click the “my stuff” button on the bottom of the screen, all that shows up is the one show I just finished watching and nothing else. The option to access my list is not on the home screen either. The platform when on the web on my desktop is amazing, I love it! But when it comes to accessing it on my iPad and iPhone, its terrible."
2017-09-18 04:09:00,So complicated!,1,Mouse Mom,False,"I don't usually write bad reviews, but this app deserves one. The old version was so easy to use and this one is very complicated and not user friendly at all! Not just the app for the iPhone or iPad, but also for Apple TV! We keep trying to use these, but get so frustrated that we give up and use another app. Please go back to being simple, and put all of our watch list info on the front page! This version makes searching or watching any program too frustrating. Ugh. The old version was so much better."
2020-09-12 07:38:21,EXAGGERATED BUFFERING,2,l_marquez167,False,Love the shows on here but it is a constant battle with the buffering! It is absolutely ridiculous! I thought it was my internet until I realized that all other apps worked fine and it didn’t matter which internet network I was on it had the same problem! If they could fix the glitches and buffering this would get a 4 star rating from me but it is a hassle watching my favorite shows because of the wait time caused by buffering.
2020-05-17 10:05:27,"Some Shows Play, Some Don’t",1,Aj luvs Kirby,False,"Some shows on the app play when you press on them, but others show a “Parse Error 2” saying something went wrong. I can watch those same shows easily on my PS4, but when I’m trying to start a show on my iPhone app it shows an error. The only way I can get around this error is by starting the first few seconds of the show on my PS4 so I can watch that show on my phone. Please fix your app to be more reliable. This is very inconvenient which is the only job of an application: conveniency."
2020-04-28 12:30:59,Won’t open any more,4,Gypsycowgirl777,False,"Just yesterday everything was fine. We pay for our subscription but now I can’t get the app to open on my iPad. I have restarted it, deleted and reloaded the app and done everything I could think of to get it to work. Developers please fix this so I can continue to enjoy your app and give it the five stars it so deserves."
2020-02-03 00:42:16,Plan is ad-free but a lot of 90 second ads,4,Please fix massive glitch,False,"Hello and this  app is amazing for all the shows that got sent out of Netflix and you are looking to watch them again.

But the thing is my plan was ad-free but it is showing me 116 second ads!

Can you fix this please and when you do, I’ll sure be around to change the rating to 5 stars!"
2020-01-27 19:30:53,Video player keeps crashing,4,discbottery,False,"The most recent update has given me issues on video playback. Every time I open the app and start streaming a show, it crashes once or twice telling me there was an error playing the video and said to restart the video and try again. Why is this happening? It’s annoying"
2019-12-27 03:00:57,Doesn’t save my shows - slow ff and rew - fix it please!,2,Me's Doodle Designs,False,"For an app I pay monthly for, it is super frustrating to have it NOT save my place in an episode if I have to close out, pause, or stop in the middle. This has been happening for months. Or shows I add to my watchlist disappear. I’d like to see these glitches get fixed.

Here we are in December of 2019 still dealing with the same issues! And your program fast forwards and rewinds painfully slow. Please fix these problems!"
2019-12-18 04:04:22,3 stars,3,ari.lover,False,This a great app overall but a few concerns there are to much ads in every thing I watch there are about 6 ads and they are over a minute long. A lot of things are locked and not able to be watched! I pay a lot and everything has a very long and boring ads But it’s a good app and please maybe change these things are take them in consideration. Thank you for your time!
2019-08-29 01:56:35,Good App Except for,3,TSelf716,False,The ads are ridiculous. When watching a tv series that only has 20-30 minutes long episodes there are 3-4 points at which it stops to show over a minute of ads. At least narrow it down to two per episode. It takes away from what I’m watching and I lose interest in even using the streaming service after having to sit through the ads.
2019-07-08 02:43:11,Crappiest app around,1,Capital F,False,"The incompetence in your service and employees is utterly atrocious. Just as many others have complained in their reviews, I have the same issues. It is not my connection. ALL other streaming apps work fine. You complete morons can’t seem to get it together. You roped me back in for a free month about five hours ago. Canceled again. You all need to find a new profession. At this point, I hope your company goes under and you are left jobless. Maybe it’ll give you a drive to try something new like flipping burgers or pole sitting."
2019-05-28 02:31:40,Ehh,3,hahanope,False,"Overall, it’s a good service and offers a lot of really good movies and tv shows. However, just like every other review on here, I’m having some troubles. Every time I try to watch something, it tells me there’s an error playing the video and I have to get out of the app and restart it. Sometimes that doesn’t even help. Frustrating to say the least, especially when I’m paying for this. PLEASE fix it!!!!"
2019-05-27 13:38:48,Ads,4,NevaehJ$,False,I feel that you should remove ads when we are trying to rewind what we have already watch mean while I’m watching a show and maybe I fall asleep I should be able to rewind without having to rewatch a AD I already seen I would and many other would appreciate this update it would benefit your app and the people who use it...
2019-04-04 21:08:17,"Expensive, flawed experience",3,Systox,False,"Charges a bit much to give you a message “you’re not ALLOWED to fast forward through advertisements for this title”. Why? I’m on the most expensive tier. Negotiate better or charge us less.

*Edit* in app experience makes it too easy to begin playing another show in the middle of your show. It has a hairline trigger and too many opportunities to misclick while you’re watching."
2019-03-13 21:52:46,Unable to use it!,3,Misconstrued20,False,"I'm very disappointed. I have been having technical issues with my account since I paid for another month, a week ago. I am not able to watch anything without the screen stating some form of an error every five minutes. I have uninstalled and reinstalled, and I'm still having issues with errors that state that I cannot play video at the moment."
2019-03-28 07:18:50,Needs new fast forward and rewind function.,2,ValentinaJuliette,False,"Don’t understand why to fast forward it’s 30 seconds. 10 seconds is just fine. Also anytime i grab my phone for whatever reason, wherever i happen to touch the video fast forwards/rewinds to that part which is very annoying. You should change it to where you have to press on a little circle to choose timing of the show you want to go to. It is very sensitive and is always changing where i’m at"
2019-01-31 04:15:07,Simple and easy,3,FKN_Carrot,False,"The app itself is straightforward and easy to use with a decent enough selection of material, however, lately there have been SO many ads that make it almost worse than watching cable. Part of the reason I enjoy streaming services is because there’s not normally any commercials, but that’s not the case here. Ads are frequent and long, but overall it’s a good product."
2019-01-03 21:36:00,Interesting,5,fanvilu,False,I would like if they had violetta but that is okay .the comercial are somewhat entertaining .overall it is a great deal and has several great options . So you should get this app  that lets you chill and is better then Netflix -thank you (if you read this I would like violetta on the options please)
2018-10-19 01:21:04,I hate when I pause the show and it freezes and you have to re-start the show  over,5,millerkrissie,False,I hate when I pause the show and it freezes and you have to re-start the show  over  they really need to fix it and then most the time it won’t let you go back
2018-11-18 04:24:27,Frustrating,1,Sunnyvirginia,False,"I get so frustrated using this app. I try to watch a show on it and cast to Chromecast but it often cuts out and disconnects and then won’t restart where I left off, but instead starts from the beginning. Even if the progress bar shows where I left off, the episode starts from the beginning. I’ve never had this much trouble using the Netflix app. Think I’ll cancel and just watch Netflix shows, as I spend more time trying to fix the issue or catch back up than I do watching actual episodes."
2020-08-02 03:06:04,Errors,5,ᖇᗩᑕᕼᗴᒪ,False,I updated the app when i saw the error i thought that it would fix the error but it wouldn't go away. i have been trying to get rid of it for a month and it still wont go away. can you fix it? its okay if you don't have time. i hope you have a great day!
2018-08-11 19:07:15,Status bar at top of screen permanently there during full screen playback,4,lbjeffries,False,"I don’t know HOW this bug got through without anyone noticing - the status bar at the top which shows the clock, connection and battery status stay on the screen and never disappear during full screen playback on my iPad.  Highly, highly distracting."
2018-08-09 06:32:00,Status bar won’t go away,3,Lindiriqui,False,"My iPad app updated between me watching shows. When I came back from taking a break, the stays bar that has the WiFi range, time and battery level will not go away! I know this is because of the update. Very distracting and the status is very bright when you’re trying to watch in the dark. Please fix! Other than that, I never have a problem with the app."
2018-04-29 05:31:43,Dubbed versions of Japanese Anime,3,Cakey the Destroyer,False,"I know this is about one topic no one really cares about, but I do, a lot! So I’ve been watching this one Anime called “Fairy Tail”. I love it with all my heart, but I can’t listen to Japanese accents when I’m trying to read, SO I use the dubbed versions, but I found out not all the seasons have dubbed versions. Only 2 out of 8 seasons have dubbed versions. Can you add them, I know there out there! But I really love this app besides that I want to watch my Anime!"
2018-04-25 19:05:04,Scroll bar moves to easily,3,mulegirl5435,False,"The only part of this app I don’t like and that is very annoying is that when you tap ever so slightly on the screen while watching/listening to a show, the scroll bar moves where you are in the show, often skipping way too far. This is annoying bc that usually includes watching a commercial so you can’t go back to where you were right away."
2018-02-01 15:30:30,Good Service,4,KDogg04,False,"Overall the service is good for the price you pay, I have live tv plus no commercials in onDemand content. The only issue I have is that live tv should be one click/swipe to get to it, my preference would be to have that where Keep Watching is now. Basically I want to see what’s live on all the channels before I select a channel to start streaming."
2018-01-24 00:31:31,Horrible Video Player UI,1,xjerrylee22x,False,"If you tap the screen by accident or when trying to pause during video playback (just about anywhere on the screen), the video will violently fast forward or rewind, completely ruining the whole video, often finishing it for you, forcing you to have to re-navigate and find the video again and hope you remember when you left off. Absolutely horrible feature, you can't even touch your device when using it with this new feature! Horrible for a phone!"
2018-01-17 04:02:58,Quality App,4,A Trustworthy Opinion,False,"It has pretty much any show you’d want to watch besides the office, and I haven’t encountered any bugs or glitches. Easy to find shows. The only thing that I find annoying is that you can’t listen to it when it isn’t on screen. Not like Netflix where you can turn your phone to sleep or switch apps and play the sound."
2017-11-02 15:05:34,Still not used to it but PIP is back!,4,Ricrdo194,False,"I use this app every single day and I still can't get used to it.  Also where is the picture in picture??? Please bring it back.

Thank you for bringing back Picture in Picture!

Also, it would be better if the show seasons are laid out on top instead of having a drop down menu (too many menus)"
2017-09-25 04:06:27,Awful interface,2,LP1016,False,"It functionally works, but the new interface is horrible. I specifically find issue when watching a show and I press pause/start. More than once I have accidentally moved places in the show trying to hit start/fast forward or backward/get the overlay to move. There's no longer a small picture of where you're fast forwarding/rewinding to so it's then tough to even find where you were. I'd watch these shows any other way, if I could."
2017-09-09 17:34:13,"Like the update, but...",2,PandaRae2017,False,"The subtitles will randomly not appear anymore. This happens quite often. When this happens, I will check the settings, and it will still have subtitles in English selected. Changing the settings to no subtitles, then back to subtitles fixes it for a while, but it gets quite annoying, since I have bad hearing and can't always fully hear what's being said.(this happens while I'm using the app on my phone, does not happen while watching on PS4)"
2020-06-05 07:41:00,Skip time,4,ItzPayton30,False,The app is amazing don’t get me wrong it’s just that if you try to skip forward in a show you don’t skip forward 10 seconds but 30 seconds which to me is quite a lot of time. I just think it’s annoying that the backwards is 10 seconds and the forward is 30 seconds. Overall the app is really good.
2020-07-31 03:38:55,Can’t watch live TV,2,IVeezy13,False,"I’ve had this app for a couple of years and all of the sudden, it says I cannot watch TV because I am not in my home. Even though I am in my home. I deleted and redone loaded the app. It told me to allow my location but, my iPhone only gave me the option to “Allow while using app” instead of allowing all the time (which I don’t understand why I can’t just “Allow” all the time) So it leaves this app useless for watching live sports or shows."
2020-07-12 22:07:36,"Buffering, freezing, crashing",2,Lori-a,False,"I have a 400Mbps internet connection, and this app buffers, freezes on screen while audio continues playing, crashes to home screen with no warning, ALL the time. I'm on the current iOS version and my app is up to date. I don't get it. I have ZERO problems with the browser version and the Fire TV version. It's so frustrating trying to watch anything with this app on iOS...you've got to do something about this."
2020-04-28 13:46:55,"Unable to open the app, However it’s my preferred streaming application.",4,Glady C.,False,"I would give the app five stars., But recently the app has been unable to open, No matter how many times I restart it, Or even restart my whole phone. I’m unsure if it’s a problem with my phone or with the app. It was still fun to use up until now, Since I can’t open it."
2020-06-01 22:40:01,Love the app but....,3,Tearnenough,False,"I’ve been watching game of thrones. I bought the HBU add-on and the show still wouldn’t work on my T.V. It’s just not there. That’s fine I’ve been watching on my phone / computer instead. Pulled out my phone this afternoon to start the next episode- suddenly GoT is no longer there either. I’m paying money for content I can’t access. Other than that the app is great, but that’s a pretty huge issue for me. 😕"
2020-05-25 03:30:44,Ad glitch,3,Recent Google-hater,False,"I’m sure everyone who has used this app for more than five minutes has experienced this but when an ad comes up, the sound of the show comes up and I can’t hear the audio and miss crucial parts of the show or there are jokes i can’t hear. This really worsens the experience of a show, which is the whole point of a streaming app. May delete this review is they fix this issue."
2018-05-07 06:28:54,It’s fine,5,beolikespoo,False,Make the back arrow button bigger dude. It’s so hard to press on my phone. So tiny and small. I always miss it and so I have to close out of the app and go back in just to change to a different show or episode which is absolutely annoying. Other then that it’s fine
2020-04-28 12:59:50,App constantly crashes,1,IPODtouchKING,False,"Constant crashing, adds are 10x louder then the show. When you watch a episode it doesn't say you finished it, it always says there’s like 45 seconds left so you constantly have “unwatched” shows in your lists. Sometimes when you continue to watch a show it will load 2 or 3 episodes back so you have to stop it and go find the right episode your actually on and now you have another unwatched episode in tour list. And now the new update won’t even let me open the app."
2020-04-28 11:57:27,Sometimes gets frustrating,3,jghhjy,False,This app is good and entertaining but there are a couple problems one it glitches every couple of minutes two after you’ve had it for a while it starts kicking you out of the app before you even see the shows and it takes a long time to load if you skip a part of a show or movie.
2020-04-25 19:31:02,It’s a great app but,4,Abi❤️🥴🤞🏽,False,I watched a show twice idk why but I did when I watched it the first time it was different more episodes came now when I watched it was less episode u need to fix that unless it’s my phone I watched it on a diff phone the second time it was on a new phone so idk but try to fix it cause I watched it on a diff acc to now I went in that acc it’s not there either so idk
2019-10-23 17:02:25,No.,1,Ahejedmdkaknd,False,"This is the first review I think Ive ever written for anything online. Tried watching World Series last night, and it impossible. It froze literally during every pitch, and I kept needing to restart everything to get it back. Only to have it happen all over again. All my other streaming services were working fine.
Based on all the recent reviews, sounds like it was happening to everyone trying to watch live tv. This app has always been spotty but last night was a new low. If it happens again tonight, Im done."
2019-09-30 22:48:06,Incomplete episodes,3,Ladiilove216,False,"My only issue with the app is that for certain shows, it doesn’t upload all of the episodes even though the episodes have come out. I was watching Black Cover and had to continue watching the rest of the episodes on this website. I hope they fix this issue because if it wasn’t for this issue, I would have given 5 stars."
2019-09-12 05:36:23,Bugs,4,Ivanbarajas16,False,I love this app and the shows on it but it’s not good at keeping track of where you left off on the episode. It gets me mad that it doesn’t keep track and sometimes it makes me watch ads again even though I already got through it. Please I just want that fixed but love everything else about the app.
2019-07-14 20:25:43,Hate This App,1,Tha Legendary Scorpio,False,"i’m beginning to hate this app especially since every update ‘claims’ to fix those pesky bugs as y’all put it, but yet updates brings about more bugs or doesn’t fix existing ones. shows i’ve added doesn’t show up under the my stuff tab on all platforms i use (phone, tablet, fire tv, n ps4).  also don’t know what’s expiring since the expiring header under my stuff tab don’t work..seriously considering canceling my subscription for 2nd time n go with other apps.  this app is becoming increasingly useless"
2019-06-19 21:11:45,Crazy app,2,Gina1592,False,This app works 50% of the time for me. I keep it updated constantly and it just doesn’t want to work when I screen it to my tv. There’s no reason why I pay what I pay for it to not work and constantly tell me that there are “errors playing this title”. Whatever I watch will play half way through and then all of a sudden have an error message for absolutely no reason. Please fix your app to work better on phones and tv screen mirroring.
2018-11-27 17:04:39,Not Great,3,Theraginasian135,False,"The content is great, but the way that they make sort through shows to get what you were watching last is at least one too many steps.

Another note, when you press the screen it goes to fast forward/rewind and I end up accidentally changing where I’m currently watching. This isn’t a necessary feature, it feels like they’re just trying to be different and IMO it’s unsuccessful."
2018-08-18 00:36:08,Horrible update,4,klitz420,False,I haven’t been having problems with the fast forward and rewind on the whole screen but I have been having problems with sometimes hitting the screen and it makes me go to my stuff. Then it plays the video in the background. I am also unable to get back to the video without closing the app
2017-10-14 20:49:42,Previous channel,5,Lao334,False,"It is a good app. Works but lags some times. Maybe that’s just my WiFi maybe it’s the app, but one thing that can improve is adding a previous channel button. This would save my time and add on to my laziness lol. This saves me from scrolling all the way up and all the way down."
2018-03-09 22:12:04,Serious problem! Fixed.,4,Peripuff,False,"I just loaded the latest update and the app keeps crashing on start. I just get the green splash page and then it closes again, his a problem.

Update: After a chat session with a helpful tech support person the problem was quickly fixed. Still, one star off for releasing a buggy update."
2018-02-26 02:11:59,This is a miserable experience,1,Gnashville_lite,False,"There is nothing redeeming about this redesign. It takes three times longer to find anything, it’s slow and glitchy and I hate the new look. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve thought I was in one menu and actually in a different one, so when I swiped right or left, I lost my place and had to start over. It’s terrible and not worth the frustration. Don’t bother with the Live option. It freezes, skips around while you’re watching ‘live’ and doesn’t record giant gaps in programs."
2018-01-18 13:22:08,Cc does not work with new update,3,Jango bango,False,"The newest update has disabled closed captioning on my iPhone. When I click the gear in the top right corner and try to turn them on, the options are grayed out and will not change. The only thing I can select is a line saying Accessibility Settings, which just takes me to my phone's settings. I already have the options turned on on my device. Please fix."
2017-09-28 02:40:53,Annoying to use,5,Hellodaggers,False,I hate how if I accidentally touch an area of the screen (or I'm just checking the time or something) on my iPad the stupid app rewinds or fast forwards even if I didn't touch the bottom timeline. Also I can't stand the home page. I like using the website on my lap too much better.
2020-06-12 00:15:16,Ugh so annoying you have to pay extra for it to be enjoyable,3,lwang24,False,This streaming service is so annoying you have to pay extra to get rid of super long ads and if you want to watch a certain show or movie sometimes it’s locked and you can’t watch it unless you pay more LIKE IS BUYING THIS NOT ENOUGH FOR YOU??? The only reason why it’s a 3 stars is because thank god my favorite shows aren’t locked🙄
2017-09-23 02:45:00,New Interface not Intuitive and is Harder to Ise,2,Jgrdaniel,False,"The interface looks beautiful, but it is not intuitive to use, and makes almost everything more difficult to use.

You can’t select the chromecast button UNTIL you play the video. One you chromecast it you can’t select subtitles like before. Navigating the different panels to select a show is confusing. 

Overall, the new interface while beautiful and promising, its unnecessarily more complicated to use. Please fix!"
2020-02-13 02:26:16,Why am I paying extra for no commercials?,3,MoomyKoosie30,False,"Half of what I watch is FULL of commercials. Yet I pay extra. Annoying. The navigation and whole app setup is not user friendly. It needs a major, updated makeover. The reason for 3 stars is bc they have pretty good content, and several live news stations as opposed to just a couple from other live option apps when I’d compared."
2020-03-31 06:13:46,Love the app but....,2,Goddess lireen,False,This app have so many various of shows to anime but the only cons about it is when it comes down to the anime like the audio even after the update why haven’t any of the animes have any voice  overs I know most people are fine with reading the subtitles and others like me would prefer to watch the show without having to read and miss the good parts of the anime if you guys can fix that it would be great and would also help a lot
2019-05-15 01:44:50,Great compared to previous versions,5,Chris645645,False,"Previously would’ve given 3 stars as the build of this app wasn’t the most user friendly.

However, they have clearly taken note of this and promptly updated to a much better user interface easily earning 5 stars."
2020-01-22 17:42:16,Annoying bugs,4,BLOODspillQ33N,False,"This really is a good app with great shows. However, the part that bugs me is the fact that it doesn’t save in the spot you left off and starts from the beginning of the episode. Can you please fix this issue. I thought it was just me but my co worker has same issue(no we don’t have same account)"
2019-11-09 01:44:15,Great improvement!,4,DHBKawika,False,The changes to the live guide is a tremendous advancement for this app.  Prior to this latest version that features severely lacking.  I have gotten a few error messages when the live video is playing within the small inset in the live guide view which is why I couldn’t give it 5 stars. aside from that no issues noted.
2019-10-13 22:43:26,Only 3 Stars after upgrade,3,aliekat42,False,"The app is not updating on my iPhone nor on my roku for watched episodes. All week it states “one new episode”, when the episode has been watched. Please fix this ASAP! Seems there are more unhappy reviews with the new changes than positive. Maybe next time you should poll your users on what they want changed than assuming you know. Please fix the glitches quickly!"
2019-08-15 00:02:20,Downloads,3,irishotaku245,False,"Ive been using this app for several months now, and Ive been really happy with the selection of titles and overall performance. My only major annoyance is that you cant download things, which gets on my nerves quite a bit, since I travel a lot for work and like to be able to watch stuff on the plane or in the car. Other than that though, the app suits my needs."
2019-07-06 03:59:06,FIX STATUS BAR,4,this username isnt taken,False,"LOVE the app, aside from one issue that keeps it from 5⭐️. This is the status bar. Whenever I start to play a show or movie, the status bar at the top of the screen has a maybe 1 in 10 shot of disappearing. The other 9 times, I can see the status bar (time, battery, and wifi/4G info) and it’s really distracting. Please fix this"
2018-11-08 03:47:09,Could use improvements,5,Mommiezbusy,False,"Love it but could be easier... 

Like netflicks, it would be nice if u could have user profiles within account because when my daughter and I watch same show at different timeframes we have to remember which episodes were on :/ 
 That’s one for now"
2019-05-06 04:57:55,"Glitchy, it only allows you to watch something from beginning to end, you cannot jump ahead",2,chay55537736788,False,"Whenever I try to pickup on a movie (any movie) where I left off it says “error playing this video”. I can always start the video from the beginning and it works fine, but I don’t want to start it over when I’m 2 hours into a movie. Updating the app hasn’t helped either. Disappointing. Guess I’ll never see the end of Jumanji or the Fyre fest documentary"
2019-01-22 07:56:04,I like it but one thing,4,enajerq,False,"Hello, really enjoy the app. It has many exiting shows! One thing m concerned is, some of the advertisements I find it offense. There are times I have to hear it over and over again and I’m t makes me uncomfortable to watch. There should be a way to choose what you want to watch ad wise. Other than that i really enjoy watching !"
2018-12-05 01:22:30,Live TV guide not updating,3,xDeadly Arrow,False,"It’s 8:00pm, despite me wanting to watch WWE on USA, I am seeing the show from the past hour. It’s as if everything is delayed by an hour. Unable to skip to the show currently playing, no luck. Close and restart app, still no luck. This is only happening on mobile but is pretty frustrating. Everything else is usually fine and works very well. Hope to see a fix soon."
2018-10-18 00:14:39,Not great,3,repub user,False,"Lately this app has been acting up. When I watch a program on my list I expect it to leave the list after watched. But this is not always happening. 20/20 will not go away. I have left it to run to the end 3 times but still there. I have uninstalled and reinstalled app but nope still there.
Edit 10/17. Having a lot of synching issues. So annoyed trying to watch when the mouthes are off."
2018-05-03 12:03:51,No good since the update,3,Kuvtutub,False,"Ever since the new updated, the back button after watching a video don’t work anymore, thought it was my iPhone, but nope even on the ipad, I can’t navigate without exiting the whole app, killing it in the background and open it up again to go to the main page. Please fix this, other then that, I love the app. The fact for a 3 star is because of the new issues."
2018-10-02 21:21:01,Certain shows,2,squeakypunk702,False,"Certain shows I like to watch will not play on my iPad any more. I’ve tried uninstalling the app and reinstalling. I went to the help section, which was a joke. The 3 main shows I watch on my iPad in the app aren’t playing. But everything else I don’t want to watch works fine. Those shows also worked on the Xbox and didn’t work on my phone. I went from watching an episode to not being able to watch the next one."
2018-07-16 09:19:44,Content won’t load,1,Doc.PJ,False,"Purchased the live tv open with 7-day free trial a week ago via Roku but the system is unable to load content. I can stream on 2nd generation appletv but I want live content.

The Roku devices and wifi connection check out fine but still no resolution. Was told the issue started on July 5th and impacting customers at random. As of yesterday the ticket was still open. An agent told me to uninstall the app from Roku for 48hrs then try again.

To their credit, they have  extended the free period but this is frustrating."
2018-01-26 02:56:38,-.-,3,Flo1216,False,"Not sure if this is just happening to me, but after the update when I’m watching a show a scene will lose audio, speed up, or repeat a scene twice. It’s very annoying, I have to be clicking the 10 second rewind to see what really happened in some scenes because it even fast forwards on its own. I’ve closed the app completely and restarted it and it still has all the glitches. Needs a new UPDATE!!"
2018-03-17 05:20:06,Your unwillingness to Succeed,1,3:D,False,Can’t display my tv shows from my phone on to the tv. The update you guys did completely messed everything up. I can’t touch my screen without accidentally clicking forward or rewinding almost every time. The account tab literally tells you to log in online... like...why have it there in the first place if you’re going to have to use the internet anyways... it’s pointless. Great job you guys. You have the potential to be better than Netflix but lack the necessary motivation.
2017-10-07 14:15:21,Service is great interface is awful,2,MrMoriarity,False,"Lots of room for improvements on the new UI especially on the Apple TV. It appears the focus has been put on “cross selling” you shows verses letting you access the shows you want easily.  The interface on the Apple TV is very  choppy and hard to use by swiping your finger around.

The service is still very good, the variety of shows, item to release and video quality are all top notch.  Need for focus on human centered design for that UI."
2017-12-28 15:09:49,New version not getting better,1,Randyrat,False,Like almost everyone else here I am becoming more and more frustrated with this app. It seems to be hated pretty unanimously and to that point I'm not sure why they haven't scrapped it. It is the least user friendly streaming application I own on any device for any service. Using it on my iPad is infuriating as it constantly skips to points in the movie/show if I accidentally touch the screen wrong. The ffwd and rwd features are not helpful. Please be rid of this new design and awful features!
2017-11-24 00:33:53,Terrible update,1,nedarter,False,"The new layout is overly confusing. I find things far more difficult to find and use. They seem to be focused on making it “modern” which increasingly means “show you one thing at a time and make things impossible to search”. 

Worse than that, I use this sometimes to stream on my Mom’s Apple TV when I go to visit, but they removed that feature for “security” reasons. It is insecure to stream tv on a tv? I think they are hoping to “secure” her as a paying customer, but that won’t happen at this point."
2017-11-16 02:49:28,Unusable,1,Nathanrb22,False,"When I’m watching a show, I will tap to see how much of the show I have left, and then try to tap to make the pause screen go away, when I’m greeting of going all the way to either the beginning or end. The way the slider works on the entire screen is just terrible. Also, when I’m watching a show and want to pause, it just won’t let me. I can’t even pause and play a show I’m watching without having to quit the app. So frustrating. I am thinking about switching to Netflix just because of these reasons."
2020-06-25 01:30:47,"Hmm, something is up.",5,Lee is a customer yeet,False,"First of all, Premium is good for people who don’t want ads but the bugs are non stop. I have to wait for hours for the hmm something is up screen to go away, all I wanna do is watch some shows, any reason why the hmm something is up screen always shows up?"
2017-09-22 01:02:48,Worst update,1,Newsnola,False,"I don't like anything so far about the new interface. It's not user friendly, the fonts are too large to read easily, seems like I have to create new profiles because they didn't save my old ones which also means I have to go back and re-save all my shows. When scrolling through a list of movies or shows, you could see the whole screen easily and now it just highlights what you have selected and fades the rest of the screen. It's all really annoying. Please re-design again."
2020-09-15 07:55:58,Glitches!,3,Ndvebevdhd,False,"Random shows just get added to my stuff all the time, “ I love Lucy” has been stuck in my stuff for months now. i’ve tried unadding it, refreshing the app, deleted my account, made a new account, re-downloaded the app, and restarted my phone. Keep in mind i’ve never watched it! i never put it in my stuff to begin with, and when i unadd it to my stuff it stays but it says it’s not in my stuff."
2020-07-13 05:22:11,Insufficient parental controls,1,Stargazer1341,False,"I'm going to cancel my subscription because there aren't sufficient parental controls. A pre-teen or teen can easily switch from kids' mode to a regular account and while I can tell that's been done, it will be after the fact. I would like to have the option to limit profiles based on ratings (TV-PG or TV-14) for example and if a profile change is requested it should ask for my password. It's not that complex but I can't risk my kid being exposed to inappropriate content cause the developers are lazy."
2019-12-01 20:04:37,My Stuff never correct,5,Moviefan92,False,I was hoping in the new update that the My Stuff area would be corrected to have only shows we save listed. Instead it had random shows that I don't watch or care about. Otherwise that app is great! Will they be correcting this issue?
2020-06-11 01:53:40,Please fix this!!!,3,Sviri143,False,I have noticed that recently the app will play the shows fine but then it goes to playing the ads but right before that it plays part of the show as if it were continuing but without audio and if you try to rewind it to watch the few seconds you missed it goes back to the ads... please fix this!!! Other than that it’s enjoyable!
2019-07-22 16:09:25,Need a Favorites list,5,Sallen6296,False,"Everything seems to work good except the Recent Channels list on Live TV. 
I don’t need to see my other family member’s recent shows which constantly changes. 
A Favorites list would be much more useful and easier to navigate to what I always watch."
2018-06-22 17:46:07,More options for older kids,5,Briana404,False,"When adding an extra account, if the person’s age is low enough they will only be able to watch kid shows... which makes sense but If the person is A TEEN they should be able to view everything located in the TEEN genre."
2019-06-26 20:38:33,Hilariously broken,1,Hash Br0wn,False,"Almost every single time I finish an episode of a show, the app is unable to handle simply moving onto the next episode, and I have to close and then re-open the app. Can’t even do one of the most basic functions of a video playback app LOL.
Now, when I finish an episode of what ever series I’m watching, instead of automatically going to the next episode, it takes me to the first episode of a series I have never watched or clicked on in my entire life. The app barely functions. Waste of money."
2019-04-23 00:23:58,Ok but could use improvement,4,vonfurstan,False,Would like to see what’s new that’s is out but would like to get rid of all shows and movies that we are not interested in at all. Allow us to ditch all shows that we don’t want to see and never see them again. On the app you have a do nut suggest this show but it comes back every time I log in.
2019-03-29 23:13:53,"Charged for no commercials, still has commercials",1,DreamBig19(me),False,"I pay for the premium subscription, Live TV with no commercials. I pay for the upgraded version, yet still have 15 minutes of commercials that I cannot skip through in most my tv shows (even the ones that are recorded). This is false advertising and customers should receive a refund. No other cable service has commercials when you want recorded shows. Ppl can get much more for the same amount of money by going to cable."
2018-12-01 04:49:25,Great but could be Better,4,Dancer-girl321,False,I love how I don’t accidentally hit a different part of my episode and it jumps there making me wait for a commercial to fix it and then another commercial to move it back. I like how it’s not so sensitive. My problem now is with the streaming to my Chromecast. Now if I go to another app it disconnects and I have to reconnect my phone every time.
2018-11-29 18:17:09,App is Struggling these Days,3,Solms-Wildenfels,False,"App doesn’t update after an episode or movie has been watched. So it still recommends it. When not updating, it also won’t show next available episodes because it doesn’t recognize that you’ve already watched the previous one.  

I’ve updated the version, uninstalled and reinstalled, logged out and logged back in with no change."
2018-10-30 05:40:22,Ads,4,eViX-Rey,False,"I hate the amount of time I have to watch. Its like 2 minutes. And the ads are repetitive.
And if you try go back and watch a certain par of the movie or episode you must watch the ad that just popped up before you tried to rewatch the certain part of the movie or episode. 5 stars if the ads were shorter and non-repetitive."
2018-10-08 13:58:43,Getting Worse Fast!,2,Boulderclay,False,"Please fix this app, I can’t believe I’m paying for it!  It freezes all the time. Once in corner mode it won’t go back to regular view. On leaving the app, it continues playing.......some mysterious where else. I can hear it, but not see it. Sometimes I have to shut down my iPad and power on to continue watching a show. It’s jumpy, twitchy and fast becoming the worst app I’ve ever tried to use. What is Hulu’s plan? I’m about to give up and watch somewhere else."
2018-09-06 06:35:47,Ads!!!!,1,CarpErin,False,"Please for the love of God adjust your ad settings. To have 4-5 minutes of ads during a 20 minute show for a paid streaming service is crazy. And, if you can’t adjust that, at least make them different ads. After seeing the same computer ad 8 times I now have a negative association with the company and product, and an otherwise fine commercial is now so annoying. Don’t you want people to binge your episodes so they will keep watching ads?? It is so annoying I turned it off."
2018-07-31 09:34:53,Audio problems again,3,Evilspoonz,False,"For a while the app would skip audio and I would miss whole chunks of sentences and after a particular update, it was no longer a problem. After this update, it is again a problem. The video continues to play just fine but the audio goes silent for a few seconds every few seconds and it is very annoying."
2018-05-11 13:57:16,Can’t tell my location,4,Theojr1,False,My whole family’s account doesn’t work anymore. It says that this video does not work in my current location...But it says that every time I want to watch a show. It is acting like I was wiped from the face of the earth and is a place where I cannot watch a single thing. Will rate 5 stars if this is fixed.
2018-03-21 07:18:58,Awful update,1,Obibjuan,False,With this new update the whole screen is used to display one show or movie at a time. Browsing for something to watch is a chore since you cannot see multiple choices on the screen at once. Once you do find a show you would like to watch you have to go to a separate menu to display more episodes where before you only had to scroll down. It seems like they wanted to make the app look sleek and modern but this was done at the expense of user friendliness and easy of use.
2017-12-10 18:00:08,Used to be a good app,1,Twinklekitkat,False,"So why don’t developers ever listen to users? So many complaints in the reviews about the sensitive FF and REW. I just want to watch TV but sometimes I need to pause or move my device. Most of the time I accidentally hit the screen and BOOM, I’ve been forwarded 20 minutes to a commercial with no way to go back until their done. Then good luck trying to find your spot again. It’s so frustrating. Why does the whole screen have to be this way?  It should just be on the bar not the entire screen. It’s maddening!"
2017-10-23 00:01:32,Great but could be better,5,1doe41,False,"This app keeps getting better.  However there is a glitch.  Every program I watch, live or not, picture freezes and sound continues for almost a minute.  Then every thing syncs up.  Fixed this and I’ll cancel my tv provider ."
2017-11-18 07:39:16,Complicated design,2,EmelyG12,False,This app would amazing if they had a different design and the shows did not skip around. It is so annoying to be constantly having to find my place in a show or in a movie because the app lost my place. I’m not even sure how it did that. And it’s getting to the point where I don’t even want to watch my shows anymore because of how annoying the jump and skips are. That’s the best word to describe the problem: ANNOYING.
2017-10-16 16:48:52,Nope,5,Mindy6324,False,"I absolutely hate this new update. Can't find my watchlist anywhere, and the app is now making you focus on 1 tv show or movie at a time rather than being able to scroll through all your saved stuff more expansively. So dumb. Wish they didn't ""fix"" what wasn't broken."
2017-10-03 05:30:31,Unreliable chromecast connectivity,5,Leo_1983,False,"New update looks nice, but feels clunky.

This wasn’t a problem prior to the app update and none of my other apps have problems connecting to the Chromecast. It’s super frustrating."

Latest August 2020 update has caused my phone to freeze and the layout for live tv is buggy. Forget about using the app with chromecast. Have to constantly close out and reload the app. Will repeat the show I’ve just watched instead of moving to the next episode and takes forever and a day to load upon starting.

You can’t even rewind back to a spot before the previous ad and are forced to watch them again. Horrible experience! Then there are so many restrictions on how you playback recorded material and no easy way to find what you recorded. Also, did I mention the frequent service drops constantly interrupting what you are watching? I have a premier package but it is the worst service of any that I have tried."

Yet I get them all the time.. 2-5 minutes into a show or movie and bam 5 minutes of ads and commercials!

I’m assuming the devs pushed a recent update and my phone automatically installed it overnight. The app crashes the same way on an iPhone 8 Plus as well as my iPhone 7 Plus. Perhaps the recent update is trying to access a restricted feature that it hasn’t asked permissions for, I know that can cause crashes based on my experience with the SDK."
2020-03-24 06:04:21,Next episode,4,Mismeasure123,False,"Nice app, it would be great if there was an easy way to go to the next episode from the player screen instead of waiting for the end of the credits, or going back to the episodes page.

I shouldn’t be getting two 90 second ads before my show even starts. I got one before the opening started, and then one right after the opening ended. And then, for the rest of the show, I get more 60-90 seconds of commercials every 4-6 minutes. I shouldn’t have that much ad time in a 20 minute episode. Please calm down on the ads, or let us skip them after like, 5-7 seconds. If the ads weren’t so bad, I would give 5 stars."

Three. Shows. We’ve tried everything we know to fix it and no luck. After I watch a freaking show it shouldn’t suggest watching it again as if I hadn’t. I’ve written about this before. Hasn’t been fixed. I want to watch new episodes I haven’t watch before. Not watch the same episode over and over and over and over again.

I would like to be able to watch at least a solid 30 minutes add free but instead i get four minutes of show and a minute and a half of ads about stuff i would never buy anyway!! Fix it and tone down the ads to either 15 seconds long or once every 20-30 minutes...
2019-08-05 22:45:38,Annoying problems,1,jcook55,False,Swiping down makes you close a video. So when you accidentally close the show you’re watching and reopen it it makes you watch an ad even if you just watched an ad before you accidentally closed the video. Wastes my time. I already pay for your service and watch ads don’t punish me for it by forcing more ads. Also when I switch between devices it doesn’t remember where I left off but remembers to show an ad.

But are you people aware of all the people using Netflix? There are toddlers, preteens, teens, young adults, adults, whatever you call people a little to old to have kids, elderly people, and very elderly people. We need more sections!!! Toddlers and kids are grouped together, but preteens and teens need their own section, too. No kiddy shows but maybe a couple cartoons teenagers like, and the movies and shows should have cussing but not out of control cussing, and no to-bad words. The private accounts are good for adults, but I’m your account you should JUST get to pick if you are a toddler, kid, preteen, teen, young adult, adult, person who are a little to old to have kids if there is a name for that, elderly person, or very elderly person. The a little to old to have kids people should be able to watch the adults section, but the elderly people and the very elderly people should have a channel without kiddy stuff and shows with little cussing. You should also be able to change your age, because over time you grow or might have a child or etc. watching on your device. Thank you for your time and consideration!

2020-05-31 08:36:57,Privacy and Security,3,subways watching,False,"Netflix is a GREAT app, I’ve probably been using it for 8 years or so. Over the past years, Netflix has expanded its operations greatly, and made viewing videos more accessible than ever. However, I feel that the privacy of the app should be increased much more. Whenever I’m watching a tv show, sometimes other members of my family try to log on and watch the SAME EXACT show on the same profile while I’m trying to watch. putting a lock on the profiles would be much better for people who want to keep their viewing private and out of the hands of people who share the account. Another issue I have is that sometimes, I’ll watch the first few minutes of a show, and I’ll end up stopping because the show is bad. removing shows out of currently watching is one of the most annoying issues this app has never fixed. I have maybe 10 shows and movies I’m watching, and scrolling through a bunch of more shows that I ended up never watching trying to find what I want to see is a big pain. Lastly, Netflix is getting really outdated. Watching classics is becoming a pain on Netflix, and the newest shows and movies are never updated. After getting a YT Tv subscription, I was able to find more complete, fuller versions of my favorite movie franchises and tv shows. Netflix needs to start upgrading its viewer base, or what Netflix became famous for-being able to watch the best shows easily-is going to be erased.

2019-09-24 18:02:44,Teen section please!,3,Cinder2014,False,"Alright, Netflix is awesome! It’s so easy to stream movies, TV shows, interactive games, and more all accessible through Netflix! The only thing that I could think of to improve this app is another section. So far there is kids and adult. But what about teens like me? Kids has a TON of cartoons and kiddy shows. Don’t get me wrong, I love cartoons as much as the next person, I just want something a bit more adventurous. The adult version has a wide variety of movies, but a lot of them are inappropriate for teens like me. If you could add a teen version, where the more appropriate movies are, that would be lovely! The movies, (no matter the rating) should be good for young audiences. This means the movies should be rated for cussing. None of the movies should have naughty things. (passionate hugging/kissing, and you know, anything that's an inappropriate display of affection) but some cussing could be allowed since in college and high school, there aren't many child-friendly peers there sadly. Another suggestion would be to (forgive me if you already have this) add a feature (free or not, your choice) where if you're watching a movie and leave the app, you can still see a small box of the screen in the corner. The box should be moveable, this way you can surf the sea of neverending emails while binging your favorite show on the wonderful app, Netflix."
2020-04-22 12:44:06,Remove Audio Description by Default - Bug Report,4,Mos Lyke,False,"Please remove audio description feature by default or remember audio description setting from one movie or episode to the next. I use the audio description feature sometimes to hear how a screenplay of a particular scene would be written because of my interest in screenwriting. When the scene is over, I turn it audio description settings off because it gets annoying quickly. However, I’ve notice this feature has been turned on by default recently in the iOS app. I haven’t really noticed if it’s the same with the tvOs or website. I tried to turn the settings off and it worked but when the current (now playing) episode or movie ends, when the next episode or movie starts, the audio description feature turns back on. I had to turn it off for every episode each time. It was really frustrating at the point I had to paused the show and write this review. Honestly, this is not really a review. I hoping your development team would consider this at a bug report. It is annoying that audio description is turn on by default and you can’t turn it off permanently for future movies or episodes. Please fix. 😡"
2020-03-05 23:01:35,Currently watching is a nightmare!,3,kro817,False,"I love Netflix and admittedly have things streaming far too often throughout the day. Everything works beautifully and it’s easy to search for what you’re looking for and the list of saved shows is fine too. My big issue, however, is with the currently watching area on the tv app, phone app, and website. Sure there are tons (and I mean TONS) of articles all over the web giving instructions on how to remove shows from the currently watching section that you no longer want to view, but Netflix it’s your job to provide an easier method for doing this. It’s unrealistic to expect people to go into their history and delete a millions episodes of a show just to get to the movies and whatever other shows they need to remove from that section. Just allow a space on the titles to remove them from that area. Especially for shows or movies that you try out and end up not liking. They stay there for months! Also, the app on tv plays the show or movie just when you’re trying to read the info about it and guess what?? That also adds that title to currently watching! Fix this issue please! It’s 2020! We shouldn’t have to google the hundreds of articles teaching people how to get around your archaic ways with this one thing. Do better, Netflix."
2020-07-22 18:39:21,amazing!!,5,krinklefries10,False,"honestly, If you haven’t gotten Netflix, what are you waiting for?!? Every single of my favorite series EVER, have been found on Netflix!! The app is significantly easy to use, and my favorite part is their always adding more!! It’s really easy to find things that your interested in because the app takes what you have watched, and recommends similar options. Most Netflix originals are also genuinely very good!

I do have two suggestions for somethings that could be implemented in the future. My  first idea is that you could be able to follow other people. This way you could find out what your friends, family, or anyone else you know, is watching/interested in. You could find lots of great shows that you didn’t know about or watch before. My second thing is something that has been mentioned in other reviews, and that is an actual, legitimate teen section. And i’m not talking tv-7. I’m  talking quality shows, PG13/TV14, stuff like that. I think both of these ideas could help improve Netflix in the future.

That’s all I have! Overall, Netflix is a wonderful app, full of great selection, amazing viewing quality, and awesome shows, movies, documentaries, you name it"
2019-11-13 16:13:38,"Downgraded instead, Not watching as much",1,Angrymonkeymermaid,False,"I noticed over the past year that I have been using Netflix less and have been really disappointed with their selection and layout. So I downgraded to the lowest possible billing option and have been great with it for months now. Layout: I wish that when I selected which genre I want to watch that it showed a years list. I like 90's suspense thrillers and kids holiday movies, 50's creature feature horror movies, and 80's action and comedy movies. But it's a bit hard to find with their made up titled sections and makes me waste more time searching than watching. And the search feature doesn't not show me all the movies in these keywords as only a few can fit on the search screen. Also, there movie selection in these categories aren't that much and I end up watching Crackle a lot more. Ended up watching Crackle and Freeform Channel for Halloween instead! I feel Netflix has too much Drama and Gore movies-not my cup of tea. I expected new seasons of ""Sabrina the teenage witch,"" ""Mystery Science Theater,"" and other such shows to be new and available for October but they were not. So knowing when to show new show seasons for holidays is lacking. Who needs the new ""Nutcracker"" movie in July!? Also, when am I going to see new ""Mystery Science Theater"" episodes? Love the new show!! Creature feature movies are really lacking on Netflix!! And when is the new ""Bright"" movie coming out!? This is why I downgraded."

First off it’s not only movies you can watch, you can watch tv shows too, and they are awesome. Now some of them do include homosexuality and I don’t like that so I just skip the parts and of movies that have them, and please don’t judge me for saying that, anyhoo, there are some top notch movies here, like a thousand words, The Kissing Booth, The Kissing Booth 2,( trust me you GOTTA watch those two) and there are cool tv shows like, The Flash, Green Arrow, Legends of tomorrow, (then again these is just dc) Marlon, The Green House academy( if you really like teen tv dramas you will really like The Green House Academy!!) any way, you can also go to the search bar and you will see the things that most people that are interested in, like the movies and tv shows. And don’t worry because yes it has a continue watching section. And the last thing that I wanna say is that YOU HAVE TO WATCH THE 2 KISSING BOOTH MOVIES!!!!!!!!!!!! Bye"
2019-12-26 01:52:40,Please show Viewers Rating/Comments???,4,Mr Isidro,False,"Why is it so difficult for you guys to add the option to read viewer written reviews which are available only through using the browser version of Netflix? 
At times it seems like Netflix has some type of agenda to limit the chances of any of their productions from getting any kind of negative or honest viewer feedback. And one of the biggest actions Netflix did to prove my point is making the ridiculous and obvious mistake of getting rid of the 5 star review system which helped fine tune which movies were recommended for us. Some of us like my entire family for example had each perfectly fine tuned the movie recommendation algorithm after working hard to submit honest ratings for every single Netflix streaming movie we'd watched for multiple years (since Netflix first started offering its streaming service). And then without even asking for its customers opinion on the matter it just gets rid of the entire rating system and implements the useless thumps up or down rating! If Netflix ends up falling from the heights it's reached it will only be because of their lack of common curtesy and respect towards its customers feedback."
2020-01-14 23:24:18,Lacks management features,2,Geeshik,False,"My issues with this app are not about streaming content, but lack of content for managing my account on my device. If there was any place where I should be able to manage my passwords and activity it should be on my device. My info (card, address, etc) is associated to my account. One can argue logging in via laptop/computer could be less secure. Especially if the web browser saves passwords and I am a user who never logs out on a computer that never locks. I at least have Two factor authentication on my phone. If I am already logged in, ask for my password or send an email to my account with a verification number. Just don’t completely strip away my ability to manage my account promptly. At the very least, I should be able to opt out/in on account management on my device via email, if necessary. This needs to be fixed. I receive phishing emails asking me to reset my password regularly. I would like to change it via app immediately, if I feel my password had been compromised. 
Rating may seem too low when everything else works well. However, security should be paramount to protect your users. There is no point having a service if that service does not have safety of its customers in mind. May as well make a walkway across the freeway."

Also if I am watching a show it doesn’t update so I’ll be on episode 13 and it’ll say I’m still on episode 11 and it’s very annoying. Please do an update to fix this issue. It’s not just my account either it’s my whole families accounts that is having this problem and a lot of other people online that I have seen while looking up a solutions to solve this issue. I have called and talked to two customer service representatives and neither one of them could help me both of them practically blamed me and said that maybe it was because I was going on another account but I’m not I’m only using my account. But anyway this is my last resort to get in touch with the company and to possibly have this issue resolved, so could you please update the app soon. Thank you much appreciated and other than that small issue I have no other problems with the app I love Netflix and so do my friends and family."

Anyways my idea that I wanted to send to Netflix is how I think instead of having 3 seasons of the show I was just talking about they would turn the comic books into episodes so people like me who don’t like to read even if there is pictures will still be able to enjoy the series. I mean we still are paying our monthly fee so you won’t have a problem with money and it will make a  lot of people happy like just ask people who like and watched Avatar the last Airbender and they will say they would have rather had a lot more seasons of said show than Legends of Korra even though I would still like to keep 👆🏻this show. I hope you read this and actually think about it I mean ask TikTok and Twitter. Also one more thing let the fans send in ideas it’s kinda of rude it’s like your saying “Your opinion doesn’t matter!!” When as a consumer it does. Have a good day bye!💕

You spent Millions upon millions of dollars just to get Friends back. Why not do the same for The Office. I guarantee, you will lose tons of people to UniversalNBC just because of one show. One Amazing spectacular show that makes me excited to get home and kick my shoes off. But just the thought of The Office leaving Netflix really gives me a stomach ache. I mean come on, it’s your most popular show and I legit will have nothing to do with my life. Half the reason I bought Netflix was for The Office, and now, well, I might just not renew my Netflix, and maybe millions of people might to. So fight, I don’t care if NBCUniversal wants their show back, you fight and you win. Wanna know why you will win, because you’ve got me and millions of other people just alike behind you. Don’t let Micheal Scott leave this company, Don’t let Jim part time at Netflix and universal, don’t let daryl follow him. And sure as hell don’t let Stanley retire from Netflix.

2020-10-21 02:58:26,The shows I watched the most were taken put of my age group,3,Kidawesome10190,False,"So I was using netflix and watching sword art online, which is a show for teens like most of the anime on netflix including, hunter x hunter, jojos bizarre adventure, blue exorcist and many more. While I was watching my show, I took a break and when I came back, I couldnt watch the show anymore. At first i thought it had gotten taken off netflix, but soon after I found it it had gotten moved to the TV MA section which made zero sense to me. These show have been rated differently and the only one the rating makes sense for are jojos bizarre adventure but the other ones I listed aren’t meant for ONLY adults. I enjoyed and was about to start watching some of these shows until netflix took them off the teen section and im not allowed to go to the adult section. I want my shows back and im hoping netflix will realize that these shows dont belong on only the adult section, but also for teens. I turn to netflix whenever I want to watch an anime without ads but if they keep moving them to age groups that dont make sense, I might as well stick to crunchyroll and funimation. Please put the shows back so that I can enjoy this app and the content that is on it."

I just wish there was a comment section underneath the shows. The show creators can can useful feedback, and comment sections can be so much fun to read through and laugh at all the funny comments. It could also give Netflix an easier way to figure out what shows to keep and what shows to take off. It can also give a better idea of what new shows to put on based on what people like. 
There have been so many times that I’ve seen an episode or a scene of a show or movie, and I wanted to scroll down to the comments to see what other people had to say. (Oh if you were to do this, it would probably be best to do a separate comment section for each episode of a show so that people don’t get spoilers)
Putting a comment section on the shows can even help to connect Netflix users. They can interact and bond over their love for a show. They can laugh over a funny scene. Or a number of other things.
All in all, I love Netflix but I think it’d be pretty cool to add a comment section"

Anyways if anyone didn’t like Netflix then you should get it together. Because Netflix is amazing 😉 😉I have one suggestion for you guys maybe you could put all the shows on Netflix and make something called Netflix world kind of like Disney world. Also you could make an app called Netflix games for an example a Good Burger make a game were you are Ed and you get to choose your own silly thing to do. And  then in the app you create your own Good burger. You choose all the characters. Then you can send them to Netflix and you can watch them. And you do that for all the things on Netflix! I know I’m being annoying but please please answer one of those suggestions. Thanks for making Netflix!!!!!!!👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️😺😺😍😍😍😀😃😃😁😁.

2019-08-17 04:02:05,My Rating Would Be Higher If Autoplay Worked Over Cellular Data,2,Hooper90,False,"Most of the time, I find Netflix to be a thoroughly enjoyable app largely free of bugs and other potential annoyances. However, I recently found myself without a reliable wi-fi connection, which obliged me to stream over my LTE data connection. Much to my exasperation, I discovered that Netflix has taken the patronizing approach of disabling autoplay when streaming via cellular data. I thought at first that this irritation might be remedied by a quick trip to my account page, where the playback settings are found. However, there is just one autoplay-related checkbox, which was checked. A call to customer service confirmed that autoplay is unavailable over cellular. I feel that this policy is frankly ridiculous. With the profusion of unlimited data plans on the market, one should at least be given the option of whether to disable autoplay over data rather than have Netflix unilaterally decide the matter. I am perfectly capable of monitoring my own cellular data use; I do not need Netflix or any other company to hold my hand and choose whether I get to use cellular data. When this nonsense is resolved, I will happily add some stars to my rating; until then, there should be a price for condescension."
2017-09-22 00:18:17,Preview loop & music & Info & Passcode,1,dallastigers,False,"I can’t stand browsing through titles anymore looking for something interesting. If I pause too long I have to deal with the noise and video loop. Music/noise is worse, but give option to stop both. 
 Why must one click done and then ok after entering ratings passcode override? 2 steps? It wasn’t great, but the app with older apple tvs was better at inputting passcode even before the added step. 
 Why with the TVOS app can I not always see all of the description of a specific episode or movie including language spoken when scrolling through episodes. I like scrolling through episodes current way better then old way where i didnt even know what season I looking at unless i scrolled to top. Just allow ability to get all the info. Put back a way to better exclude things on main menu I will never watch. For example I only like stand up comedy in a club with a group of people watching together live I will never watch stand up comedy on Netflix so please quit showing them to me. Others may love them. Make it easier for both of us.  I have tried to give thumbs down over and over. You used to be better at putting shows in menu I may want to watch without searching or being hidden by a ton of stuff i will never watch. 

 Non-app issue. Quality Content has been lacking."
2019-09-14 15:06:44,Updates are horrible,2,PJ3256,False,"I know longer will update anything from Netflix. Every update is worse than the one before. When I started years ago you had like 8 pages of every genre and what we liked & disliked, you numbered our watchlists so we were aware of how many we were adding there. It was a very simple method to move items from say 352 to number 4, there was a rating of 1 to 5, showing what most people liked and what we liked. All of these things have been removed and it wasn’t for our benefit. Every update has major flaws just updated my app on my iPad to find my watchlist on my fire tv still had 352 items in it. Luckily I don’t ever update that one and on the iPad after the update it shows I have 76. When you try to change the order in your list, it can only be done from a computer and once again 1/2 of my watchlist is missing. Now making that impossible to do. Keep making bad choices and not listening to your customers and you will find you are no longer getting more customers, in fact you might start to see a lot of your very loyal customers paying for maybe 3 months a year instead of paying every month for 6 or more years. Get it together and start listening to what people like and want."
2020-03-17 14:00:13,Can't stand the constant previews,1,Faithful Journalist Surrenders,False,"I avoid searching for shows on Netflix because I hate this insistence on showing parts of the movie or show when you're trying to read what it's about or are just scanning through a category. If I know what I'm going to watch, I go straight to it, and the original and international content is unmatched. But I despise being force-fed trailers and previews on any TV service, showing you before you watch what you're about to watch, and getting it in hacked up bits that reveal a lot of the best moments. And Netflix is by far the worst. So much for being surprised, thrilled and delighted by unanticipated events. A lot of us watch for the surprises and the fun in trying to guess what's coming next. Hey, Netflix, we're already on your service and intent on watching your TV and movie shows. You've got to understand that subtlety has great virtue and we're smart enough to figure out what we want to try without being shoveled bits like dummies. Besides, we also know that trailers are extensively edited, of course, and intended to show off only the best action and character lines. What we see, especially the lightening pacing and exaggerated action, is often not what we get. The previews don't reflect the quality of a production and may turn us off to things we'd otherwise try."
2020-10-14 17:26:24,"Good, but has some bugs and I have a suggestion",4,CheetoPuff41,False,"I love Netflix; it is way cheaper than cable but is a way better deal. I watch anime on Netflix, and a lot of the time the subtitles with just stop working. I’m not good at understanding Japanese, so this is a problem. I have to exit out of my show and then wait for my continue watching to refresh and tap it again. It’s not hard to do, but it gets annoying after a while. I was really happy when Netflix made the update where you can delete from your continue watching, but Disney+ has a new feature on their app called GroupWatch, and I would love to see that on Netflix, because my sister likes to watch anime with me. If you don’t know what GroupWatch is, it’s where you can invite someone to watch with you via text or something and then up to 6 people can watch the same thing on different devices and accounts together, synced. (Also I just want to say Hunter x Hunter is a very good action anime and I love it but Netflix needs to get Love is War on there and also needs to add the rest of the Hunter x Hunter episodes on there but you can watch anime on VRV if you want)"
2020-08-13 13:54:50,Needs a little something more,4,WaswzadaCQfdger,False,So don’t get me wrong it’s a great app but a few suggestions. Whoever said they would like a teen option I agree with. And also I think there should be like a option for 9-13 year olds section not like teenage yet but not like kiddy cartoons and tv shows . And then also with a 9-13 year old section that means in the kids section there won’t be stuff like not inappropriate but like just a little to old for kids like 8 and under . And there should also be a young adult section so like for adults that are 18-28 so like not tv ma rated things on there. I personally think that tv ma means only ages 30 and up are aloud to watch not even super responsible people so tv ma shouldn’t be on any section younger than adult. And I say this because I’m a tween and I get a little mad when it says for you and there’s a bunch of kids shows . And also there should be a section for like 40-60 so a little to old to have kids and in to elderly. And a section for elders so ages 60 and up. If the creators are reading this review if you could do at least most of the things I said I would give it a five star rating.
2020-03-09 19:48:34,Netflix originals=Love/Hate,4,Lucky2toes,False,"This review is mainly about Netflix original series. Most of them are really good! They have cool ideas for shows and spare no expense getting some of the best in Hollywood. The problem is Netflix puts out too many too fast. Viewers can not keep up so shows might not get watched for years after they were created. Therefore Netflix doesn’t get the feedback fast enough about what viewers like and dislike. Shows that are really good end up getting canceled and shows that are not good continue. No one likes getting hooked on a show, watching a few seasons, then it just ends with no explanation only to find out it was canceled last year! Example...Santa Clarita Diet. Great show with the perfect cast. Invested 3 seasons to find out Netflix canceled it almost 1 year ago. Just seems like if Netflix focused more on quality instead of quantity when it comes to their originals, viewers would have a much better experience. Other than that, Netflix is awesome. But, you don’t want to disappoint viewers or waste $ on shows being canceled or never taking off when viewers have a lot more options these days."
2018-12-08 06:20:02,"Netflix is The Best, Although there is one Major Issue",4,Zee Rshd,False,"I really hope this gets read by someone who can do something about it. I love the Netflix, but It’s really disappointing how most of the shows and movies I want to watch aren’t available in my region. Sometimes the show or the series might be there, but the latest season might not. I’m a huge fan of The Vampire Diaries The Originals and I’ve been waiting for you guys to update the originals for MONTHS now. I’ve googled a bit and found out it is available in some of the other regions. This is the ONLY frustrating thing about Netflix for me, and it really disheartens me. I’d really love it and be extremely thankful if all the latest updates could be provided to all the regions because it really is a huge disappointment. Probably the only reason people decide to unsubscribe from Netflix, some of the people I know did. It’s truly unsatisfying when we don’t get to watch everything we paid for. Although overall I’d say, it’s a great app. If you could just fix this one issue (one really frustrating issue by the way), it’d be perfect! ❤️"

2018-07-20 03:29:43,No description,1,Guiness51,False,"I don’t know who comes up with these updates for the app but they’re terrible. First it was the taking away of the star rating. Which means I can’t get an idea on whether the show/movie might be good before wasting my time watching. Now the latest nonsense of taking away the brief description of what the show is about. Instead it’s just a list of genres the show/movie falls under. I, like many other people, enjoy many different genres of shows and movies. For example I’m not going to watch a movie simply because it’s an action movie. It’s the same even for documentaries which makes even less sense. Say a documentary is on Egypt. How can I tell it’s going to be something that I’d be interested in just the few genre and descriptor words? It could be about things I already know about Egypt or it could be talking about new discoveries and facts I’ve never heard of. Whomever is making the decision to allow these ridiculous updates is awful I’m not saying fire this person but them and everyone else involved in these updates should be allocated to a new task within Netflix. My account alone isn’t keeping Netflix afloat so this isn’t any threat but I’m so close to canceling my account. It’s getting less and less worth the money I’m charged for it."

I live in a rural area so I don’t get good internet service and therefor can not stream hardly (pretty much not at all). Still, I got Netflix when I found out you can download and watch it. So I thought I could download my shows at work or in town, or pretty much anywhere I have good signal or internet access. The problem is it takes so long to download just one show! (Like sometimes I wait nearly an hour or longer for one show or movie), then when I go to watch it, half the time it gets messed up and stops working on the middle of it and will not play. Also, I’ve had a couple times where I tried downloading something and the download failed, but when I try again it won’t allow me to do so because it says I have exceeded the number of downloads for that particular movie or episode, even though I never actually had it downloaded, so then I can’t watch it. They need to fix it so that you can download and it actually works every time! I’m losing my patience with it and may be canceling if it doesn’t get better."

I liked it a lot but then there was a slight problem. When someone else is watching the  the same show and he or she goes to a different episode. That  I was not on it go’s to my iPad. I was thinking maybe they were going on my account but then they told me they didn’t so hella confused😯🤨🤔. And sometimes when I have headphones it will turn up the sound and I want to see if it works on any other app no it does not😑👌.

As I was searching for something to watch I saw multiple shows and movies but as I pressed them they did not show the play icon the multiple show I first clicked on was archer I was shocked to see it on here and recently been wanting to watch it so I clicked on the icon but no play icon was to be seen I did press other shows to see if it would work like Rupaul’s drag race and the last air bender and those did not work either. So I thought I should see if it worked on my phone but as I looked on my phone I did not even see these shows on their it would be nice if you all could fix this and the was another The last Airbender that the date said it was set to come out 2020 I don’t know if this was on purpose or not but please fix this as soon as possible"

2019-03-27 03:22:30,Quality of content has really declined,1,coffinwheezin,False,"Used to be our go-to app for streaming even though we subscribed to others.  Content was great, navigation was intuitive, and the app worked exceptionally well.  Unfortunately all of the above has changed. We rarely watch it. The content has taken a real dive in quality. Fewer quality movies, too much reality tv trash, and too much low quality foreign programming (the better quality stuff is on a different streaming service).  There used to be a rating system in the app that affected the kinds of shows that show up in your queue. Really miss that.  And the navigation changes are terrible. Talk about fixing something that wasn’t broken!!  The search tool and other functions were moved to a sidebar - as if someone said “let’s copy the worst elements of browser design and slap it on our app.”  And the annoying “still watching?” window that interrupts streaming should have an adjustable setting - especially after the new April 2019 rate hike.  It will make Netflix the most expensive service we stream.  Luckily there’s growing competition in the streaming space, and 2019 is going to be a good year for new streaming services.  Of the 4 streaming apps we subscribe to this one is securely in 3rd place and falling."
2019-04-17 20:58:15,Nothing bad to say but...,5,WolfGirl07_YT,False,"Netflix is one of my favorite tv providers, first to a few others. From Stranger Things to bird box, it has amazing things on it. Also, if there is a movie out in theaters that would normally cost like 30 dollars to rent, especially if it just came out, all I have to do is wait and most likely it will pop up on Netflix! And even better is after I Finnish watching that I can watch a whole bunch of other things instead of being sad that it is over. I highly recommend Netflix, it’s amazing especially for the price. The price does go up over time, but I don’t mind, as long as I can still watch Stranger Things XD! Thank you for reading this. Oh and by the way, the only bad thing kinda bad I have to say is, why do you remove such good shows?  You may have a really good show on, then like a month or two later I can’t watch it crii. So instead of removing things just bring the price up a little or something... but still, I will always and never won’t be a true Netflix fan. 😁"
2019-02-13 21:44:21,Please stop taking off the good and more older shows,3,paris.london.tokyo,False,"Before all the Netflix Originals were  replacing good and more older shows it was a great app. It had many throwback shows that I still love to this day and it was in general a great app for me. Now they are taking off shows with no warning. I was watching Buffy the Vampire Slayer, when it was on Netflix, and I was really into it. Then I was on Snapchat and I had to find out from there that it was going to get taken off of the app. Why can’t they have a section for the shows they are going to take off, so we can at least know if a show we were going to watch is getting taken off and watch it quickly. And I’m very disappointed that they took off many of the older tv shows that were around when I was younger because now I have no where to watch them. Netflix is the only app I can use to watch shows, but now I have to either rewatch shows that are on there or watch Netflix originals that are a season long, on average, and have 10 20 minute episodes. WHY WOULD YOU REPLACE A SHOW THAT HAD MORE CONTENT FOR A SHOW THAT HAS 1 SEASON AND TAKES A YEAR TO PRODUCE ANOTHER ONE THAT IS JUST AS SHORT!"
2018-08-03 00:19:59,Netflix is King of Stream!!,5,John Modest,False,"I love that this is still the best value streaming service and the Netflix team hasn’t gone money hungry with the “pay extra for no ads” like their competitors have. EASILY.. the best and biggest selection for a cheap price. I dig the multiple profiles not just 2 or 3(new animations are cool and fresh btw). Even big families like my own can enjoy and have their own shows and movies the kids and adults would like to watch. The app is so easy a toddler can navigate to their favorite children shows. Thanks for Stranger Things, for adding the new Transformer film and the constant flow of Marvel blockbusters.. on top of having the Flash and Arrow among other DC comics television shows. Although I would ask that the team work on list alerts on when a show or movie will be removed soon.. especially when we have it on our list. I get disappointed when I plan to watch something and when I remember to, I’m too late as it has been removed from Netflix. Other than that, I believe this app is perfect."
2020-07-30 06:57:07,Some things I’d like to have on Netflix,3,doulikecjocolate,False,"Don’t get me wrong, I love how they put great shows and all, but I don’t really seem to enjoy when the anime (or any other type of shows) is left on a cliffhanger, and the answer to the cliffhanger is on the next season. But they don’t take in the next season! And it takes really long to get more of the show! And I don’t really like when the anime’s  are Japanese and with English subs I really do prefer English dubs. So it’s kinda hard for me to search for some of those. For an example, Seven Deadly Sins. I waited FOREVER for the next season, and now it’s coming soon. And well, Seven Deadly came on Netflix many years back, and it comes kind of delayed. I recently watched Haikyuu!!
So, that means I need to wait another few years so that I can continue watching the rest of the show, and plus, Netflix almost never has Anime’s that aren’t dubbed, so they’ve always got my back on that one. But, what I’m trying to say is, I really do hope Netflix can do one show at a time, but with all the episodes and seasons, then going onto other shows! At least give it a thought?
But I really enjoy watching on Netflix!"

I watch so many episodes on Netflix. I am a young viewer, so Netflix has child appropriate thing for kids to watch that will help with their health. For adults, Netflix has a section for adults so they won’t have to watch kid stuff, they can watch whatever they want. I can even type in the tittle in the search web so I don’t have to keep on browsing and browsing and browsing to find the best thing to watch! Netflix also is sooooooo entertaining! It’s just like... EVERYTHING!! I don’t know why this isn’t a five star, it should at least get a five and a half! Y’all Netflix haters, just delete Netflix and let’s see how entertain you can keep yourself on some boring days where you have nothing to do. You’ll regret being like “Omg! Netflix is so boring” Netflix is LIFE!!!!"
2019-01-09 00:42:14,I want to be able to see any show no matter the country,2,VeryImportanForAMusicLover,False,"I was recently in Mexico for Christmas break and I was going through Netflix to see what I could add to my list so when I came back to the USA I had some new things to watch, to my surprise I found Naruto Shipudden and wolf children. I was surprise to find these since I done plenty of search before and never came across them, but most importantly I was so excited to watch them. I wasn’t made aware that when I cross the border they would be gone from my device. It’s almost a shame I was starting to love Netflix but finding out that what I want to watch differs from country too country it’s not worth the price I’m paying since I run the risk of going to another country where if I choose to take my list of Netflix to watch over there in my spare time I run the risk of my show or movie disappearing from my device. The whole “it’s about location, popularity, and purchasing rights.” Shouldn’t fall under what people are paying in order to watch what they want, people are unique and they watch different shows, I thought the viewer was more important than the location and the popularity of a specific show or movie."

2018-04-22 17:04:06,"A Gods App/GUI, but...",3,peaceguy,False,"Netflix is great-for the most part, but there are some things it needs to work on... a.) It needs a ‘Forward 10 seconds (or 20) as well as having the ‘rewind 10 seconds’ button in the iOS app. Many times I switch from TV to my iPhone, & for whatever reason, it hasn’t caught up to where I left off on the TV. I’d like to be able to hit a ‘skip 20 seconds’ button so I can get to exactly where I left off (the scroller is just too small & inaccurate..). b.) The fact that Netflix discontinues shows/movies is a big negative. I hear this complaint - a LOT. Netflix, if you’re going to continue raising your prices, you need to keep shows on either INDEFINITELY (especially POPULAR shows), or give us a clear warning as to WHEN IT WILL BE LOST! This is a BIG pain. In he iPhone app, you don’t have that. c.) I agree with other users’ complaints that you need to stop the automatic (loud) content ads, or give us the option to turn the audio OFF on them. Who needs that?  Every scroll to another show creates a new blaring ad for the show I’ve accidentally scrolled to. Please stop.. Other than that... etc."

There are multiple evidence proving his innocence yet you did not show that in your film. The people are getting enough of your racist system. You “The American system and media” are racist against anyone with a color. We love the people but we hate your profiling system. We are humans with good deeds and you keep picturing us as a threat to you! We know you do all of this to have a reason to invade our countries and STEAL our oil. We know that the CIA is controlling your media and we know that we will defeat you by our humane work around the world. We are the Muslims and we will win at the end either you like this fact or not. SURRENDER now and let’s live in peace or we will make you by our good work by our beautiful work by our pure hearts. There is much less racism in the Muslim world and we see that because we see our colored brothers and sisters are standing around the world except in our nations because we treat everyone equally. We don’t profile people upon their race. We don’t invade other countries because we want their resources. We are the most peaceful people around the world and anyone traveled to a Muslim country knows that. At the end we demand JUSTICE FOR KHALED!
2018-10-12 04:04:08,New home screen auto-preview feature is destroying Netflix experience,3,banzaicat,False,"Unfair of me to write this here but Netflix offers no way at browser to offer product feedback (vs a call or chat initiation) and I know others are feeling the same. The new feature where Netflix begins auto playing a show if you hover above it on home screen  for 3 seconds while trying to browse (on various applications such as Roku) has destroyed the experience. It creates “noise” literally and figuratively and weird urgency. Many want to browse, actually peruse and think. The auto preview feature creates a rushed and intrusive experience. Muting is only option but so distracting. Clearly they aren’t listening to customers because similar posts are all over web (including the fact many may have children in room while scrolling and some of noise/violence is unexpected. Ruining the integrated Netflix experience between apps. No setting at all to disable and *no this isn’t same as auto play or auto preview at END of watching show* but is part of home screen experience. No other complaints about Netflix, at all."

As a company you don't have to be biased! I understand that Netflix is mostly run by white males but that does not mean that you cannot be more educated about other cultures and less racist !!! Some people may claim they are racist but deep in them, it is not about the ""racist word"" you say about your actions. Netflix has proven to be a racist company.

2018-12-16 13:45:38,Netflix original shows freezing,5,kylann❤️,False,I don’t know if this happens to anyone else but every time I watch a Netflix original show ( made by Netflix) it will play for a little bit and then it will freeze on one image and the audio will keep playing and I either have to Press the skip button four times or go out of the app and restart and it is super frustrating because it happens to every Netflix original show for example it happens watching free Rein and nailed it and fuller house. And this only happens on my phone when I watch it on my tv it’s perfectly fine. I am not sure if it’s just my phone but it just doesn’t make sense that it only happens to Netflix original shows and it’s super annoying especially because are usually watch them on my phone and not the TV because it’s more convenient but it will always freeze and I have to skip it or restart every time and when it freezes it will freeze about four times in one episode
2018-05-02 22:07:38,"Great and all, but is it?",3,Speakfortruth#01,False,"I have loved Netflix ever since it was created.  And when I was introduced to Netflix, It was outstanding! But the one thing I have seen in reviews was, “ it needs more shows” , or “ shows are being token off Netflix”.  And even though I love it, I have to agree with the people.  Even my little brother understands ( and he’s a Netflix person.) !  My brother loves Sonic, for example, and I know there is the new series on Boomerang or Cartoon Network, called “ Sonic Boom” , and that’s when I realized, why isn’t the new series on Netflix? Also why aren’t you adding more seasons to series as well? My brother used to like Lego Ninjago and I know they have like a season 6, 7, 8 etc. , so why not put that on, for instance? And please don’t take away any old shows or movies that other reviewers have talked about! I love Netflix, and others do too. So why not do what they want? Having all the episodes everyone loved!  It’s a great app and all, so I suggest having it, but my suggestion should be heard! Some things DO NEED to be changed eventually, and I think of this as one thing to be changed."
2020-09-07 23:13:13,teen section would be nice,3,HelloSilly,False,"so I know a lot of teens also want this and I’m hoping you listen to us. There is a kids and adult section. the adult section would be great except there’s a lot of inappropriate stuff and some people have strict parents that make them use the kid section... which is absolutely terrible. There’s tons of stupid little kidy cartoons that I don’t wanna watch. I’m fine with the kid sitcoms but like you need to make a teen section with the kid sitcoms and teen shows and movies! Also if you do make a teen section you need to add THE OFFICE and also Mr. Iglesias and Gilmore girls. I do in fact like the show Sister, Sister and Once upon a time but all of these shows and more need to be added together in one section.... the teen section!!! A lot of teens and their parents don’t care about the cuss words in shows and movies so if u would add movies with light cussing my parents wouldn’t really care. As long as their isn’t any crazy passionate scenes or f bombs every 5 minutes, add it to the teen section!!! I’m begging you I really need a teen section it would make me and many other teens love Netflix so much more. 🙂"

2020-04-11 21:49:35,Do you read any reviews?!,1,Annie Poppo,False,"OK so if you read any of the reviews for your app then you should know that the main complaint of people is to bring back old shows that you decided are good enough to be on Netflix. So my question is and comment is why don’t you bring back some of the old shows that people have written millions of reviews just to bring back? And if you got an answer for this which I am pretty sure you won’t cover I am wondering why there are so many comments with very very bad reviews why you haven’t fixed any of it, you have all the time in the world now so I just wonder why you don’t bring back old shows that people want to rewatch and relive desperately but you decide that shows like oh I don’t know the one I’ve written three reviews about the haunting hour that was an incredible show me and my cousin and some of my friends loved watching it but you didn’t bring that back in the matter how many reviews I wrote why, I don’t know but there are so many reviews that you don’t seem to read about bringing back old shows you rarely do that and some people have been deleting your app because it’s lost it’s charm and doesn’t provide actually good shows anymore"
2020-05-30 00:51:53,"Great app, needs some improvements",4,Mason_42,False,"I love the app, but it has lots of room for improvements. Starting, I don’t know why they removed rating movies. It really helped me decide what was worth watching, now we just have a like or dislike system where it can’t see other viewers opinions about it, so it’s pointless for the viewers. Second, I get the Netflix originals are meant to tempt people to get Netflix for certain shows, but they need quality over quantity. Nobody cares about how ever many shows or movies that are originals, people care a lot more about a few movies and shows that are really good and have a large following. Lastly, this kind of goes with the second one, but we need more original movies and shows that everybody knows and loves. For example, Polar Express, I Am Legend, Spongebob, and many others I can’t think of right now. Hopefully these actually get read and these suggestions might eventually get passed on, though I have my doubts, but it’s worth a shot. Anyways, good app and I recommend getting"
2019-12-20 02:17:04,Unsubscribed,1,Jasmine.Tavarez,False,"Netflix was my go-to app. I would spend hours and hours watching movies and shows on Netflix. My family and I would have our own profiles with our own likings on each profile. But I am a Christian at heart, and I know that there are many different belief systems and many things that I will not agree with but I know there should be respect at the end of the day. This movie that Netflix aired on their app just made me go crazy. It was the movie about a “gay” Jesus and it was about a choice the “gay” Jesus had to make, if he wanted to be with his gay boyfriend or die on the cross for us. It bothers me because it disrespects my belief system very bad. At first it didn’t bother me because there are many people who disrespect my religion so I thought, “hmmm, I don’t agree with it but oh well Netflix is a private company.” But they are making fun of my religion because I do believe God sent his only son Jesus to come to earth and die for us on the cross so he can wash away our sins. But there are many people who won’t agree with me. Cool ✌🏽that’s on you. But Netflix shouldn’t disrespect me and many other Christians or many other believers of Jesus Christ. I unsubscribed. Bye Netflix you won’t get any money from me anymore."
2019-05-16 04:34:43,How to: 1.Use w/ old iPad 2.See A-Z,5,S. Barnes,False,"1. If you downloaded Netflix before on your iPad but deleted it like I did when I unsubscribed for a few years, you can get it on you ""old"" device. If it says ""not compatible"" etc., download it on your iPhone (or I guess another device signed in with your Apple ID in the app store) and then go back to your iPad. It will download. I had to talk to four people from Apple and two people from Netflix to get the app on my iPad from 2011, but it was worth it! Passing the info it on to anyone who can use it.

2. You can't see content A-Z (that is, a list of all of the TV Shows and all of the movies that Netflix offers sans algorithm) on the iPhone app. But you can see it on a computer! On the Netflix homepage click on TV Shows (or Movies) and click where it says GENRES. Select A-Z from the drop down menu. I was holding back one star for lack of transparency but now happily give this streaming service and its app all five! Yaaay Netflix!"
2018-12-04 09:04:28,It offended you?,5,Happyplayer123,False,"To remove a show or movie because it offends someone is ridiculous!  There are several choices that you have that ""offend"" me, know what I do about it?  I don't watch it.  I know, it's crazy thinking but seriously???  I love Netflix and it's choices. It's opened my world to new genres that I wouldn't have normally paid any attention to.  Who knew it would be so much fun to watch British bakers?
The app itself is fine but I do have a few things I would like to see changed.   Please give us control over the continue watching section.  Twice when I watched the last show of a series, a new series that I didn't choose (change number 2, don't automatically start a new anything other than a trailer) started automatically and now I can't get it off of of the list.  I've tried fast forwarding to the end and that didn't work. Make it go away!!! Change three, bring back the ratings.   I'm pretty happy with Netflix overall."
2017-11-19 03:28:58,The service is great the app only so-so,4,St. Jimmy777,False,"I love watching Netflix on my phone because I'm constantly on the go but sometimes I need half an hour to watch a TV show. I love the download feature which I use ever time I fly home for break. But there are some things I hope they'll consider changing. For starters let's talk about this audio description thing. I don't understand why it's the default option on my phone and there's no way to change it. I would appreciate if you added an option to change the default language setting so I'm not constantly having to switch while I'm binge watching. Secondly, the ratings system needs to return to the star system. The thumbs up and down system is to broad and I can't imagine it helps the algorithm that lists potential movies and shows I would like. If I was only lukewarm about the movie then liking it would only show more movies I wouldn't like and disliking it might hide the ones I might like. Other than that it is a really nice app that I love using"
2018-07-08 19:39:55,Very upset with the Netflix weekly updates on iOS devices,3,Francisco Lopardo,False,"Currently Netflix updates the application weekly, and that is something very positive. But the reason I do not agree with the updates is that they do not include any good news, they do not make positive interface changes or optimize the app. I hope this review helps you to improve future updates of Netflix. One of the new features that I would like you to include in the Netflix interface is that you implement two 10-second buttons in order to delay and advance a series or movie since you can not currently do so, I would also like to be able to set a default playback quality either 720p, 1080p or 2160p so that when you start the title start at the quality you chose. A problem that I just noticed in a series is that House of Cards does not have the option of omitting intro and that intro is very long, the button does not appear to omit intro in any of my devices in the House of Cards series. I hope you solve it for the next update and take my words into account. Thank you"

They should also put better tv shows and movies on like seriously there is nothing for me to watch I live in Ireland and whenever I go to America the movies and tv shows are AWESOME I love but then I come back and the movies are the same and it's just plane BORING they need to put some better tv shows or movies and overall fix a lot of the glitches there are quite a few 

So overall you can download it but just limit yourself to movies and shows a few times the seasons have glitched sometimes it says there is 11 seasons so I keep watching and it ends..... At season 5 I mean it's okay so download it yes and there is no adds can't get that too often so there are ups and downs"

2018-11-12 20:42:05,Thank you for restoring descriptions!,4,tiruvenkadu,False,"I've changed my rating to 4 stars, as you've restored descriptions to the app. It's so much easier to tell if something would be interesting to me! So many more new things added to my list now.

It's still only 4 stars instead of 5, for 2 reasons:

1) It's still buggy/laggy. There are times that, for no discernible reason, I try to load a show - or even just hit the ""10 seconds back"" button - and it never, ever loads. I often have to quit the app and restart it and, in extreme cases, switch off the iPad and restart it. This should be a rare-if-ever occurrence, not a fairly common one.

2) I, like many other commenters, preferred the ""star"" rating system - both because of my own reactions to various films/shows, but also for the algorithm it used: I could look at how a show was rated by others, and get a pretty good idea of whether or not it would be worth my time to check out. Since moving to ""thumbs up/thumbs down"", not only do I not bother to rate any movie I don't specifically love, but I have no idea what algorithm it's using to determine whether or not I'd like it. It's usually pretty off in its estimates now anyway; I'm guessing it makes assumptions based on categories or something?

Overall, the app is decent. Its algorithms are weird, and it can be hard to know what Netflix has to offer without specifically searching for it as it doctors its display to what it thinks I want to see, but the app is mostly functional."
2020-07-29 20:01:15,Netflix developers need to read this,4,Mama688479,False,"So, Netflix isn’t perfect. I have some questions and suggestions:
Questions
1. Are all the Pocoyo Season 4 episodes on Netflix?
2. If Total Drama World Tour and Total Drama Revenge of the Island isn’t available can you say it in the description for Total Drama?
(Edited in question) Are episodes of some shows out of order? If so, which shows?
3. Are they gonna make Season 5 of Nailed It! and/or sometime near Christmas make a Season 3 of Nailed It! Holiday? If so, I can’t wait!
4. (Edited in on July 27) Why will you guys have to get rid of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (2005)?
Problems
So, sometimes when I look at some episodes of shows some episodes have the same picture. Can you fix it?
Suggestions
1. There was a suggestion for making teen profiles. I kinda agree. You guys should add that
2. Make a thing in the settings of profiles so that you can turn on or turn off the thing when after a few episodes it says Are you still watching “the show you watch”
3. Make more Nailed It! because it’s different then other baking shows and it’s better than other baking competitions
4. Make a Season 4 of Captain Underpants because the other Captain Underpants they made like the Epic Choice-o-Rama isn’t very good.(What I mean is some of the choices you can’t actually make the character ACTUALLY CHOOSE to do the choice you chose. It isn’t as good as Minecraft Story Mode)
Anyway, that’s just what I think. So, please answer people who make Netflix."
2018-09-02 09:05:43,I love the mobile app...but...,4,desidenni,False,I love Netflix period. I wouldn’t know what to do with out it. My kids watch Netflix more then the tv stations!! I only have 2 complaints about the mobile app. #1 i wish you would put back the part where when you click on a show/movie it would tell you what its about instead of “tags” that the show would fall under while searching around for something to watch in that category you picked. #2 i reallllllllyyyyyyy wish you guys would make it so you can fast forward when your watching something. Like if something popped up you didnt want to see you could hurry and fast forward through it on the mobile app. Other then that i dont have any problems. I really do love Netflix. Ive had it for 4 years and id NEVER get rid of it and i tell people constantly to get Netflix. But please fix those 2 things and i think it would be a full 5 star rating. If I could do more then 5 i would once those get fixed. 😊 thankyou!
2018-12-30 00:17:09,What it’s missing...,3,ShugLu,False,"The app is great I’ve been using it on and off for about 6yrs now. I was using it when they only charged you about $7/month. 😩 oh how I miss those days. Movies have came a long way they’re more “up to date”, however,  I miss when let us rate the movies by stars or even see how many stars the movies got. Now all you do is give it a thumbs up or down? If I’ve watched a movie and rated it, it shouldn’t be listed as a suggestion any more. In fact they should keep it in the watch it again category. I remember when I could watch a movie, rate it, and then new movies would appear that may or may not be similar. The point Im making is after watching a movie I’m wasn’t constantly searching for a movie because new ones would pop up as long as I was watching. Now I just find myself aimlessly scrolling for a new movie to come across (if I find one). So yea, more new movies even if they’re not Netflix related. But your Netflix movies and tv shows have been quite interesting so keep up the good work in that department. 😉"
2018-04-16 03:27:12,Apple/ITunes/Billing,1,I Am Second 2 God,False,"I strongly recommend when setting up Netflix services to do it straight through the Netflix web site  and avoid this app when subscribing, signing up any new member ship through this  Apple iTunes app. Reason being is Netflix is under strict contracts terms with Apple iTunes which limits capabilities to canceling your account, modifying payments or adjustments. Apple iTunes has full control over those specific things under contract terms. With majority of the consumers this is a very important factor. I personally had to learn the hard way. I followed the terms, canceled my subscription 24hrs before the billing date, and Apple iTunes still tried billing me another month. I received a email from Apple stating there was a billing issue. Shortly after I called Apple and clearly canceled 24 hrs before the billing date explaining the reason there is a billing issue. I was told I would have to pay for another month of service and that It wasn’t 24hrs before cancellation. I hope this review will be beneficial before subscribing to a new membership using this app and strongly recommend already having a membership before attempting to down load.

Netflix is great and all but for some reason, there a strange thing that happened in Netflix while I was in there. A year ago I was so excited to watch my little pony and for some reason their was no new season just only season 8. I looked of the date that it should come out in Netflix and said April 2019 and it was passed April 2019. I decided to look for glitch or updates and there was nothing( I’m not saying this is really bad because it also happened in a other place like Disney plus). Then decided to wait for a whole and not really my little pony and my little and saw that there were clips of it in videos. I don’t know what the problem is but hope that can get fixed and it’s like when they say it’s coming out at this time then, it doesn’t. This is just a little that happen to me on Netflix."

It also has a lot of drama. I recommend Netflix for all ages. Netflix has a good mix of kids shows, baby’s shows, shows for adults, and family shows.

Now , I am not sure if it will stay without an english option , or maybe because the anime is a sorta new show added to Netflix ( 2018 ) and they just haven’t made the english one yet, i’m not sure.

First, the movies. There are many movies that I see in which are unavailable in my country or have been removed and only available in other countries. I think this is a problem. For example, White Chicks. I had been looking forward to rewatching White Chicks, but then I had seen it was removed. I hope that they don’t remove these from our country anymore because I really enjoyed some shows that had used to be there but are not now. The second is not a big issue, but I believe it is something the people of Netflix can fix easily. Why is there only a way to move back instead of forward. It takes me a painful time to go and try to move forward a little. Instead, it just skips a minute when I only wanted to go 20 seconds ahead.

Also stop removing shows as that really makes it hard to enjoy Netflix when are there all is trendy shows that some like. And a lot of the shows being removed and shortened some will say it is because there old but there are shows from like 1991 here and your removing 2000 shows this is a bad thing to do because soon that will be your adult audience and when they wanna watch there child hood shows they won’t be there and they will stop using Netflix.

2018-03-09 18:12:44,Love it but!!!,5,Myankee286,False,You guys have to change the review on the actual app like the comment above me said you can only do thumbs up and thumbs down that is not good at all. What if I think the movie is OK or just want to be able to expand on my review not just thumbs up or thumbs down. And besides that I love Netflix. I wish they wereAnd more variety of movies. Overall I have no problem with that flicks except the price went up two dollars. Keep it up and please change the review thumbs up thumbs down option. Make it a star like this and you can write something. I actually liked when you had that little anime animation where they would help you browse and you would just pick adventure and it would go through a bunch of movies and you would select them that was cool. I hope wish they bring that back I forgot what it was called that it would start talking to you and asking you what you liked and what not.

Now whenever I search it, it's not there. Its the only thing making me dislike using Netflix. Since the show gets older as a new year comes, they go away. I don't know if you designed it this way or it does it itself but I can't use Netflix that way. I'm running out of shows and movies to watch. I cant watch Kickin It, Make It Pop, The Karate Kid, and tooons more. Please fix this because I miss watching the shows, and I never finished watching Make It Pop! Netflix is full of biting stuff I don't watch now, so please do that. I'm sure maybe other people are aware of this and want to watch shows that are disappearing. Also I started rewatching Lab Rats a few weeks ago. I noticed it said at the top "" Leaving On March #"" then after a few days it disappeared! I miss the old shows and I want you to bring them back!

Most of the movies are to childish or to adultish and mostly crap either toddlers watch or elderly people or adults watch . They need to put out more teen drama movies. I have had netflix for like 1 year and i have watched every teen drama movie there is. I get that it is mostly adults out there watching netflix. But y'all need to put more teen dramas back on. And i just found out that other country's have more shows and movies. My favorite show in the world is pretty little liars . The only place i could watch it was on Netflix. They ended up removing it but Germany and canada still have it. And as soon as movies come out they should be put on netflix if its not a netflix origanal. Like some movies came out 8 months ago and are just now being put on netflix. That is all i had to say but over all it is a good app.
2018-05-14 17:59:25,Options...,4,CA Whit,False,"Easily 4 1/2 stars!
First... Please bring some of those television networks biggest hits back again. Some weren’t out there long enough to enjoy all of the seasons. (I am rather new to the binge-watching craze.)
Why isn’t there the option to “binge watch” for a set number of “continuous hours”, similar to other networks or even a “sleep timer” option? If I binge-watch a “half-hour episode” (which are really only about 20 minutes, at best, for network television), I am only allowed “3” episodes on a Roku and BlueRay, before Netflix asks; “Are you still watching?” That is only about an hour of binge-watching! Even less if you watch episodes from a WiFi-tablet, cellular phone or home computer. To search for a remote or to keep clicking “Yes, I am STILL here!” on every single episode no matter what you choose to watch on. It is a rather trivial request, I know. 
...But really, those are my biggest complaints. Other than those;   Netflix is 5* stars!!!!!"
2018-07-28 20:07:55,The death of intellect.,1,Inky Squid,False,"Why, may I ask, does Netflix seem to think it's users so incompetent, that it must annoyingly play movies without the user even clicking play when we open a movie menu, why do the cancerous preview loops play completely without our control or consent, why have all the facets of the app become gradually more and more ""intuitive""? Which is a misnomer, made in our time to only mean incredibly babying. 

As I don't wish this review to become so prolix as to hinder someone's reading of it, my final complaint will be with Netflix's ""original content,"" and to that all I can say, is whom ever let their child in the animation studio, however proud they are of their child, has no right to torment us with the child's hideous scribblings. Where is the fidelity to great animation and literary excellence anymore!?

And don't just tell me not to watch them then, for you can be reassured that I do not, I'm just afraid that if we allow this sub par material, we will soon notice that sub par has become the new standard. It's been happening for years, I'm sure because sub par is cheaper to make, and if we are sold on it as par standard we'll eat it up."

I watch everything from movies to stand ups to series. I love how Netflix constantly is adding new shows. Sadly, I had to rate 4 out of 5 because some of my favorite shows and movies are not on netflix. The series I am talking about is The Wayans Bros. The movies I’m talking about are Stomp the Yard, Battle of the Year, and Think Like a Man. I do understand Netflix can’t have every movie or every show, but this did disappoint me. If Netflix added some of these or similar to what I listed I would be thrilled! If they got added my rating would be at 5 stars. If Netflix isn’t able to get them I do understand, though I would be a little sad. My rating would have to stay at 4 stars. Netflix is still amazing though, Like I said, I watch netflix for an average of 5 hours a day! Sometimes even more than that! Netflix is incredible, hope my review gets read and considered!"

However with one of the latest updates, the time no longer displays on the top of the screen if I’m watching on my phone. I have to slide down the screen to check the time. It’s just something small, but I miss being able to just tap the screen to check the time. If there was a way to make that display optional or always there, I’d love that. 
Also I don’t understand why you can only download things a couple times. If you’re rewatching a show and are going somewhere without WiFi, you might not be able to download that episode you’re on if you already downloaded it the last times you watched it. It just doesn’t make sense, and I don’t want to have to go thru data if I don’t have to. 
Just a couple minor things that I wanted to point out but I still love Netflix. Thanks!"

But one day I was looking through the App Store and it said that I could “Update” Netflix. So I pressed it and later on I wanted to watch TV and I did not see it so I went to the App Store and it said 12+!!! And I was so MAD, Sad, and FRUSTRATED!! The only thing i looked forward to was Netflix and now that’s ruined. AT OF ALL TIMES Y’ALL PICK QUARANTINE TO TAKE NETFLIX AWAY!!! Now I have to wait until August comes around to watch my shows😤😡😞😒

All I’m saying is make it 9+ please I beg. I am bored and alone.🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾

2019-08-11 16:42:25,How bout a shuffle button?,4,@ p3r50n,False,"Netflix is excellent. I find myself watching it constantly. There are many great shows and movies on there, as well as originals (i.e. “Stranger Things”, “Love, Death & Robots”, “Black Mirror”, etc). This mobile app’s ability to download certain shows and movies is also pretty genius. My one suggestion for improvement though is that a shuffle button would be a great addition to Netflix. If ever you can’t find a show or movie to watch, you could “shuffle all” and it would pick something random for you to watch. Or you could sort by categories, for example, and it would choose a certain comedy, action show, etc for you to watch. This could also come in handy if someone were re-watching a show (like “The Office, “Parks and Recreation”, “Friends”, etc), and couldn’t decide on a specific episode. 

All in all, something that’s absolutely worth the download, but could be even greater with a shuffle button!"
2020-03-21 01:36:39,How to fix the flix,3,thegoofygiraffe,False,"Netflix is great, because I can stream my favorite shows and movies anywhere, anytime. But that doesn’t mean that it is completely problem free. I have two issues with the app. The first one is the obvious one. Allow me to spell it out for you: NETFLIX NEEDS A TEEN SECTION. You have a section for adults and one for kids, so what the heck is so hard about making a teen section?? It could have cartoons like The dragon prince and the she-ra reboot (which is really good) While also having the live action series like A series of unfortunate events. It could also have the movies in the kid’s section that are PG and PG-13, like some marvel movies. But nothing MA or R rated, because that will ruin everything. Please consider this. 
My next issue is that once I accidentally deleted the app and once I recovered the app, it wouldn’t let me redownload my movies and shows because I  “reached the yearly download for them.”  I was both frustrated and confused by this and wonder if I can ever redownload everything again. Thanks for reading!"

Why? Oh I do not know but what I do know Netflix needs to add more movies and shows so here is my list of stuff you need to put back on then after you put back on I will rate you five star so here is the list Victorious, Sam and Cat, sponge bob both, full house, puppy dog pals, teen titans go, descendants1,2,3 , Madagascar all of them, sherk all of them too, Moana, Zootopia, Mickey Mouse club house vampira .

Usually are used to watch Netflix on my TV but when we had to go places and I wanted to watch Netflix I couldn’t because we can’t pack a TV. But now once I get Internet and I’m going somewhere I can watch Netflix as much as I want! Part2: I don’t understand why people are complaining about Netflix. If you don’t like the app then don’t download it. Also I don’t like how people are saying it needs more improvement because I think it’s already perfect! The only improvement it needs is adding more anime shows on the kids thing. Because I love anime and I go on the kids Icon. This is why I love Netflix and also this is why I don’t understand people are complaining about it even though they should just delete the app if they don’t like it.

2020-04-25 16:11:24,New features.,5,Lax_Cuz,False,"The brightness bar on the left side of the screen you guys have implemented is pretty cool! But something that would be even better would be a volume bar on the right side of the screen! 

Every now and then I find my self adjusting the brightness to the lighting in the room for my best watching experience although I only really end up adjusting that once or twice, however the volume is a different story. I constantly find my self adjusting the volume to my likings and yes yes I know we have volume buttons on the side of our phones. But when you have your phone propped up on a surface it isn’t ideal to pick your phone up just to play with the volume. Instead having a little onscreen tool to just quickly adjust would be absolutely amazing!

Other than that great app! Just wish that certain shows and movies weren’t getting constantly removed :("
2020-04-23 04:50:53,Pretty good but needs some more update on things.,3,POPPIE PIEEEE,False,"I’m a big anime lover my self. I have noticed but I’ve been wondering why these anime’s do not have all the seasons added? When the new seasons are added they should also be added very soon to Netflix. Like let’s say Haikyu there’s only 2 seasons added to Netflix so far then I heard the other seasons 3-4 are all ready here, and it says on Netflix it’s not coming out in November when it’s April!? But Netflix I don’t understand why you can’t add the seasons right away? So I seen naruto and it has a 9 seasons total. Then I’m a huge fan of fairy tail also. But then I found out there’s also 9 seasons on fairy tail but there’s only 1 season on Netflix!? I mean naruto been in the 2000’s but fairy tail should also have its 9 seasons added just like naruto I seen lots of people also questioning this also! But this might drive away some people that watch Netflix and they might buy some other apps so Netflix I need too hurry up with the the seasons because people can’t wait so long!"
2019-08-21 04:53:09,Some thing that would make Netflix better,5,chezzeronie,False,"I was thinking that there should be something that tells you if something new happens to MY LIST. For example the “It’s Official: Another Season Is Coming” Only as a notification. Another example would be when the new episodes come out on something in MY LIST, that could be a notification. I know that there is already a notification thing on the app but I don’t care about the other shows that I don’t watch. I mean I like how it shows new arrivals. And you could just do my suggestion like that. Notification space in the app has new arrivals and anything new about any shows in MY LIST. But again I don’t care about the other shows I don’t watch. But for people who want notifications of course. Thank you anyways for reading my suggestion! I hope you don’t take anything to offense. Thank you again for reading this!"

That is amazing. My problem with Netflix now is, they are taking away a lot of shows that I freaking watched, over and over and over again. They have taken away American Dad, The Cleveland Show, and Bob’s Burgers, And now they are starting to take away Family Guy. I have watched everyone of those shows at least 23x each. ( Yes I have a problem ) and now that just took them away. They also took away my childhood shows too, like 6Teen, Invader Zim, And Crowder.. I understand that you need to make some space for new stuff.. but you could still make space and leave stuff on there, you should just clean out all the shows that are Netflix Originals that got canceled. Or clean out the stuff that no one watches. But hey, I still love using Netflix, I’ll never stop using it, it’s just a small issue that I have."

Some of the movies on Netflix are old and boring or some are for older people (adults) and some of the kid/teen shows are not very interesting, The scary movies are pretty cool its just that I wish like seriously wish IT was on Netflix, It cost money to watch it which I think is stupid, the only way to watch it for FREE is if you have a Fire Box which I don’t have one, Thats why I think it should be on Netflix but lets get onto another movie, I’ve been really into mean girls and I really wanna watch it, but again you need to buy it to watch it which i think is stupid because its an old movie and it should be free, but you know, cant always get ur way but it would be awesome to be on Netflix, But so far Netflix is pretty good and its easy to watch movies and I love the app a lot, im just saying- everything I said is my opinion but this is just what i wanted to say so yeah."

2019-04-09 23:10:50,Mostly well done.,3,theRealSixtyOne,False,"The app works great and is updated without issues very regularly. My problems with it are that the suggestions seem to be more what Netflix wants me to see rather than what I would like to see. There is also NO WAY to tell the app to ""never clutter up my screen with this title again!"" I’ve seen it. I hated it, yet it persists. There are certain actors I will never watch, no way to tell Netflix to stop cluttering the screen with these things either. It is very frustrating to have to go through the same set of dreary offerings all the time. They use some sort of scoring to guess what I may like, how about letting me tell you exactly what I do not like to help hone the suggestions? Clear the clutter I hate and maybe I’ll see something from the tens of thousands of possibilities that I might not have seen before! PLEASE!

Also, no way to make an app feature request inside the app either as far as I can tell. Seems like they are missing an opportunity there as well."
2019-04-02 04:27:10,Needs filters,3,probablyannoyed,False,"As someone who’s been with Netflix since I was getting DVDs in the mail, ALL I’ve been waiting for is a way to filter/organize/ alphabetize MY LIST. I don’t need random shuffling orders or 300+ added items to scroll through. I just need to separate TV shows from movies because I’ll probably fall asleep in an hour or just add new things to my list.  Or have them organized by category. Sometimes I’m in the mood for a mystery. Sometimes I want a comedy. Sometimes I had coffee and want to try and binge 50 episodes of a Korean drama in a weekend... sometimes I want to put my phone down and pay attention to subtitles. 
And maybe too much to ask, but the majority of my ratings are 3 stars because they’re “meh”. Neither thumbs up or thumbs down. Is there like a sideways thumb rating...? Cuz otherwise I don’t rate anymore.
I have more ideas- ability to post what you’re watching/ share/discuss what episode you’re on with others without spoiling anything because you know they watched it too?"
2018-03-13 05:12:17,Love it!!!,5,Pickles Bacon and radio,False,"I don’t see how Netflix could get any better except maybe y’all could add a “suggestion box”? It would be a good way me and every other Netflix user out there to say what movies/tv shows we want because there are tons of stuff I can’t find anywhere and I don’t want to pay $20 for a 10 episode tv show that looks interesting. Also I would love it if y’all added Dragons: riders of berk, dragons: defenders of berk, and how to train your dragon 2. I know y’all used to have the first two and probably removed them because no one watched them but with how to train your dragon 3 coming out this summer lots of loyal Netflix users will be trying to watch them. So please consider adding those 3 movie/ shows and consider a “suggestion box”. Please!!! Also it would be nice if there was a watch later option so you don’t have to add something you want to watch to your list."

First, I absolutely HATE that once again I can’t access my account info, particularly viewing activity, through the app. This seems to be a feature that comes and goes but it is such a hassle to log in on a separate device to remove a show I no longer want to watch.  I also wish Netflix would somehow indicate foreign films/shows.  I don’t like dubbing or subtitles and find it very disappointing to get excited about a show only to find it’s not something I’ll watch.  Finally, I don’t really like the thumbs up/down rating system.  Like other reviewers, I prefer the sliding scale of the star system.  I find it gives me a more accurate understanding of how much I liked movies/shows I’ve watched.

Overall, Netflix is a great deal for the price but could be even better with a few simple changes."

Why can’t I just send an email to inform them that the latest update of the app I had to install on my device is having bug problems?? The “skip intro” button isn’t working or appearing properly. Also, the last few minutes of the episodes of Gilmore Girls I’ve been watching have been replaced with a frozen image of the opening of the next episode. The sound plays correctly for the last few minutes of the episode I’m watching but the screen is showing a frozen image of the beginning of the next episode! It’s ridiculous that I have to write a review to bring these issues to light instead of just being able to write an email!

It’s quite certain your taking off old shows for new, although it is your job on stake.. it would be exceptional if you could keep some old ones too. As you know, there are problems out there, but some of us want our old shows back and we want new shows too. Netflix isn’t the best when it sometimes makes us resign in!

Shameless, American Horror Story and Stranger Things are all great shows (to name a few.) But the generation I grew up in is missing a lot of our shows. Things from Disney Channel, Nickelodeon I mean y’all used to have Spongebob and where did it go? Not happy about that. So I’d definitely recommend adding more shows for teens, not just kids and adults. Also, the movies that are on Netflix are mostly garbage. Besides the category that spews a few classics that no one really bothers to watch, there’s no good movies. Horror movies aren’t scary, the documentaries are all about murderers or prison and the other strange assortment of movies are just... not good. I think y’all should let people pick from an assortment of movies and shows to stream: like they have the full list of things available to be delivered to your doorstep and be able to stream it instead... face it y’all gotta step up your game and doorstep movie delivery is a dying era."

I would just give in and put in the extra money but I can’t and if I were to ask my roommates about it they’d complain about not having jobs.

But lately there’s been this kind of annoying thing on the mobile app. When your watching a show, movie, etc you can’t see the time or percent charge anymore you have to close out the app or go back to the browse screen. At first I didn’t notice it but as time went it got increasingly annoying. Like many people I binge watch on my phone for extensive amounts of time so I need to keep tabs on my battery percentage or if how much longer I can watch before having to go to bed or something. But now I keep losing track of time and over binging since the time isn’t right there.

Anyways my big problem is the “ are you still watching” I find that extremely Araic and pointless I mean I’m the kind of person that needs to fall asleep to a tv and let it run. It surprisingly keeps me a sleep and I also hate the dark so it provides light and a noise over for little squeaks and other small noises that might creep me out and then make me stay up -I have and ocd disorder- and not the cleaning type. A worrying type. I am also the kind of person that just binge watches there show all day. But with this are u still watching thing it keeps doing that through my day. I am also the kind of person that looses my remote easliy. So that’s why I gave it the review I did and I really hope that they do fix this issue."

However, I can't tell if it's the algorithms they use for recommendations, or the fact that the recommendations dominate my experience, but the more I watch things on Netflix, the harder it is for me to find new things I like. The other day I got on a friend's profile and remembered a bunch of shows I have always wanted to try but failed to show up on my recommended options.m.  I like to discover shows on my own because I get tired of one genre all of the time, or am not satisfied with something similar to what I have watched but isn't necessarily as good. Also sometimes I start watching something I hate for a bit and it also affects my recommendations. What is the pint of on-demand??? Instead Netflix tells me what I want, the interface makes it hard to see past the recommendations I don't want, and I spend forever trying to find something I might want."
2018-02-20 02:50:32,Parental Controls- not helpful,1,VickyR8,False,"I just recently subscribed to Netflix because it offers a lot of great shows and movies for all ages. I heard a lot of people talking about it and I wanted to try it out and liked it. I loved 13 reasons why, stranger things and okja, to name a few. What I don’t like is the x-rated stuff on there that they call UR or NR and the limited parental controls. Not everything that’s unrated is of a sexually explicit nature but some of it is. So if I want to protect my teenagers from watching porn on Netflix, I can’t because if I am okay with certain unrated documentaries, I can’t set any guidelines for that. I actually can’t set guidelines between R-rated and rated-MA, it’s like an All or nothing type of parental control system. I would like to be able to select up to an R rating and block MA and most unrated shows but I can’t. I would also like the option to remove certain shows/movies from my account to make sure my kids don’t watch them. It’s hard enough these days to protect your kids, but this parental control system in Netflix doesn’t help at all. I just might have to cancel :("

And2 the titles on my phone display that they are in HD they even says it’s supported only HD when my phone is a 4K HDR resolution to phone I thought it was a glitch but it turns out it’s not cuz when I watch a movie in 4K from the Apple store the movie looks 100x better I’ve even played titles the same movies titles that Netflix is playing and man I’ll tell you the resolution looks totally different so I’m like why if I’m paying xtra for 4K HDR in my service I’m not getting 4K on my phone as well when my phone can play 4K just fine and I’m paying for the service I think Netflix is robbing the clients that pay xtra for the 4K and not get it on all my devices especially when the device is perfectly compatible with  4K really upset with this"
2018-08-31 14:58:01,I’d Love It If We Could Archive Shows,4,FlameBiscuit,False,"On the off chance someone at Netflix sees this, I was wondering if there’s any way to do an update where you can “archive” shows on your list that you’ve already watched. At one point, I had about 30-40 items in my list, so finding something I hadn’t watched yet was very difficult and time consuming. On the other hand, I don’t want to remove any movies from my list because I want to be able to find them quickly and rewatch them without having to go to Search every time. It’s also a struggle remembering which shows are completed and which are awaiting a new season, and a way to differentiate between the two would be very useful. If there was an option to archive a show/movie after I’ve watched it, possibly by transferring into a list made exactly for this purpose, I feel that it would be extremely helpful to me as an avid Netflix-watcher."

But what I used to love the most about Netflix was that they had a lot of Disney shows that I LOVED! I think I speak for everybody when I say that there a lot of movies and shows on Netflix that aren’t very popular and could be taken off , instead of the Disney shows that that I used to watch everyday on Netflix like lab rats , ant farm , and Jessie. PLEASEEEE Netflix add those shows back on ! I very strongly think they are more popular and it dissatisfied a lot of people when those were taken off instead of other shows and movies that aren’t viewed as much . A lot of people have told me the same thing and said that they would watch Netflix a lot more if those shows were on and some people told me they stopped paying to have Netflix because the selection isint as interesting anymore. That’s all I really have to say , so please consider adding those back on."
2019-06-30 04:53:11,Great service.,3,L-dubs85,False,"Don’t get me wrong here Netflix is great to watch shows on and catch up or start new ones, but I was looking for a slightly older show, but it had a great amount of seasons, this show is “Digimon digital adventures” while this one was taken down its sequel show “Digimon fusion” is still here with 2 seasons and the better one had 6 seasons like I wanted a trip down memory lane, like relive a time when things didn’t mean a whole lot and we (as kids) could see ourselves in this world living it out and making a connection with the characters. All I’m asking is if the company were to read this PLEASE add back this show, it means a lot to many, many people including me and I am just 15 and I remember it. Also get rid of Nexo Knights(1 SEASON)and Ninjago(5 seasons(respectable)),but that’s Disney they have their own platform, and Pac-Man that only got 2 seasons as well so take out the weaker ones or other streaming services content and put in other ones that were WAY BETTER!."
2018-07-16 01:00:42,Hotel Transylvania! Please!,4,DatOneWolfGirl,False,"Netflix does have Hotel Transylvania, the series, but it doesn’t have the first and second Hotel Transylvania movies. I understand that the third one just came out and is in theaters, but people are going to want to start watching one and two again. Honestly, they are some of my favorite movies, and I do not watch movies all that often, as I tend to watch TV shows on Netflix rather then movies. I have searched it up more then once, and all I get is the series and a few other movies with the word, ‘hotel’ in them. I have already watched the entire series and am dying to see the movies again. I know you can’t have every movie up at once, but please put Hotel Transylvania up again. Mavis is my favorite character, so I’m trying to get her full backstory, and for that I need the other movies. (Also I want to watch them again for fun.) So please, but them up again. Thank you in advance!"
2020-09-01 19:49:34,A little gross 🤢🤢🤮,4,Animatronic4539,False,"So I’m a kid, and I’m learning new things. But this, I think I might be sick. So I have the kids setting, (on Netflix) and I saw a new show called Oh Yuck! I was about to watch the show when I started looking through the episodes and I saw things about fungus and pimples. I have a pimple myself, and it makes me feel quite embarrassed. One episode I saw a BLOODY FOOT. I don’t think this show should be on Netflix and that was my reasoning why. A bloody foot should not be showed to my 6 year old brother. I have never seen the show, but that’s why. The rest of the app is fine though. I know that this might hit kids my age, but I don’t think this is the best way to do it, so bloody feet, nuh uh. No way. Please send me feedback. It would make me happy. Hi, I just updated it, right now, and I saw operation ouch! I just threw up. It’s very inappropriate for kids. This is on the kids setting. I hate this! Take oh yuck and operation ouch off NOW!!!!!"
2020-04-23 03:01:31,Make a preteen section please!,4,Simplyareccomendation,False,I like the app but I do have a recommendation. You should make a preteens section because the kids one is really kids it has cartoons and stuff that preteens don’t watch. But then the adult section is not appropriate for their age. I think that you should do do a preteens section that can provide cartoons but also more coming of age movies and tv shows so that they can find stuff that doesn’t bore them. This would be wonderful if you could do. The preteen that lives in my house thinks that Netflix is a great platform but finds that the kids section is boring her with cartoons and movies and tv shows that she simply doesn’t watch. If this happens in the future please know that they are preteens and they need shows and movies that are appropriate to them. I like this platform and have been using it for a while but this is something that keeps coming up to bug me. Thank you.
2019-07-12 04:30:12,Could be improved...,4,K. Hrbek,False,"Netflix is my go to app for movies & series, but I feel it can be improved. For one, I STRONGLY SUGGEST to add a “ Stop Watching “ button in case you no longer have interest in a movie or series ( especially a series ) instead of having to fast forward or restart your profile just to get it off your “ Continue Watching “ list. Another thing is that I’m not bilingual so when an interesting movie catches my eye and the description is in English, but the entire movie isn’t, it’s kind of upsetting especially if I’ve already clicked play hence the “ Stop Watching “ suggestion. I know I can watch it with it being dubbed but I kind of like the words to match the lip movements so that’s not an option. Maybe in the description Netflix can add, “ French, German, Spanish” etc so other people know before clicking or maybe even have them in their own category like “ Foreign Movies “ or something."
2018-10-30 02:55:16,Netflix,4,kaykaynx,False,"I really love Netflix but the two things I want Netflix to change. 1. When you download an episode of a show you can only download it twice. This is really unfortunate because once you tap the episode to watch it, it goes on a timer of when it’s going to expire. I like to watch Netflix on car trips and when I have no service so I download my movies or shows but sometimes there is the one episode on a show that you really like to watch and then you can’t download it anymore so you cant watch it without service witch I think defeats the whole purpose of being able to download it. So the only thing I wish Netflix could change is letting everyone download, what they want to download, as many times as they want. 2. I thinks that all movies and shows should be able to download. If the Netflix company could fix these small problems then Netflix would be better."
2020-04-15 14:12:02,My opinion on Netflix,4,-norelys,False,"Netflix is a great app where you can watch many movies, shows, etc. I was looking for a good website to watch an anime I really wanted to finish when my brother told me to try Netflix. I stayed with Netflix because I got to finish the anime I was watching. I've used Netflix for maybe more than 4 months now. I recommend Netflix because it's really good, and there's no way you've seen EVERY movie or show on Netflix, so theres a lot to watch. The best part about Netflix is that there are no commercials, and you can watch what you want offline. People who like to binge watch, or watch moives and stuff like that, will certainly love Netflix. Some downfalls of this app are, paying for Netflix monthly, the selection of movies/shows depends on where you live, and it takes a while for a new season/episode to come out. Overall this app is great and you probably won't be disappointed."
2020-05-10 03:24:47,Netflix please read and reply,5,sillypants0719,False,"I’m pretty happy with the service that I have received and I would like to recommend making a teen section so when watching there is a place for adults, teens, and lastly children so if it has blood and gore or cuss words it is aloud on the teen account but If it has scenes that shouldn’t be seen by children like nudity then it stays to the adult account so please add that but I’m not happy that all of my favorite movies are disappearing for example “Sweeney Todd:the demon barber of fleet streat” has been taken Off and I grew up watching that and it is my absolute favorite movie and to see that it was removed was very saddening, so what’s next the corpse bride??!! Come on guys before you go deleting things please ask about others and see what they think because how else am I to watch my favorite movie now??!! That’s right I can’t so thanks!"
2018-09-22 21:37:52,Great but one problem....,4,Mystical._.Mate,False,"Okay I loveeee NETLIX is sooo amazing. I use it all the time. But one thing, whenever watching an anime or whatever...the animes usually have more seasons but on Netflix it only has 1 season. Even though the anime has about 6 seasons. It truly leaves you on a cliffhanger. Especially when it’s hard to find the other seasons when you don’t have any other way to watch them. It’s a bit sad because I really love Netflix but if there is one thing I could change about it... it would be the fact that NETLIX should have more seasons when it comes to the series. It really annoys the people who watch it. Plus most of us don’t want to spend more money just to watch it on another platform. Please Netflix change this one thing. If it was changed, I would have a complete new perspective on how Netflix is. It’s just truly frustrating knowing that you’re left on a cliffhanger. Thank you..."

Please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please put Hawaii-5-0 back on Netflix I was on season 5 and there is no way I can watch it on regular tv and on demand it only goes down to season 7 and you still have to pay for most of the episodes.

Have a great day! 😊"
2018-06-05 03:03:31,"Great, but...",4,Wolfsrule02,False,"I love Netflix and I'm on it all the time, but recently I've noticed that shows that I've just started watching or in the middle of have started disappearing. The problem is not that they were removed completely, like taken off the actual app, but that I'll see them on another account and it's not because of parental controls or anything the shows could be any rating and still disappear. I can search and search but the shows are just gone, at first I thought that it might've just been that I haven't watched that specific show in a while (I sometimes wait to watch the last episode till there's another season or something) but no it happens even if I watched an episode the day before. I would appreciate if this was fixed or at least looked at, other than that I think that Netflix is a great app and I'm not going to stop watching any time soon."
2020-10-16 19:27:46,Doesn’t work with airplay. Show selection rapidly declining.,1,Haninay,False,"First: seriously, why would you have a video app on an apple product and not have it work with airplay?

I’m not a fan of the majority of Netflix shows that I’ve seen (most are poorly made and acted and how did they manage to ruin Arrested Development?), and the few that are good are always canceled after a few seasons no matter how popular they are, and so you are rarely able to go on a binge session with any of their shows. And now they are not holding onto any of the shows that so many of us enjoy, I guess so they can spend their money making 500 new garbage shows instead of one good one?

And the app itself is so frustrating because even if you do find something you want to watch while you’re traveling and think, “hey! I want to use AirPlay to watch this in my hotel!” That’s too bad because apparently they are in a fight with Apple and have disabled that feature out of spite. Well, good work. After being a Netflix subscriber since they sent out DVDs, I am out after Stranger Things season 4."
2020-04-04 18:09:32,Best Thing In The World,5,Natalie El-Assi,False,I love Netflix soooooo much they have a variety of so many shows. Also they also make there own shows and movies. This is super cheap and such a nice way to chill. You can basically find any show or movie you can think of. Their Netflix originals are awesome to and so perfect. I know a lot of people who love Netflix. There is nothing wrong with it and there is never a glitch or a crash. I think Netflix provides the best movie quality at a very affordable price. I recommend this to anyone who wants to find a good affordable tv watching system. And especially during the coronavirus you can chill on 5 devices for only 15$ a month watching your favorite shows. I really think anyone looking to find a affordable tv system should get this. I wish the best to everyone during this virus and I hope you have a great day🙏🏻☺️😊
2019-09-29 18:43:44,It’s great but has flaws,3,Why is life cruel,False,"I really enjoy Netflix and yes there are some great options but in the Anime section there is barely and child appropriate anime’s I can watch with my cousins and also you should get more anime options like get some more anime movies and actually get anime’s like danganronpa cause not many places have that and the kids account really needs more movies like some good movies it gets boring it just feels like your putting more effort on the adult account more than the child account so I think you need to actually even it out 

Another problem is that some anime’s doesn’t have a English audio and I watch anime with my sister so she can read the subtitles that fast, also in saiki k. Only one season has English audio while seasons 2 and 3 only have Japanese audio I kind of find it unfair to people who watch anime but can read that fast have to pause the show or movie to read the subtitles it takes time for people to actually enjoy the movie"
2020-02-19 05:36:25,"Great app, one problem!",4,hxneypop,False,"Okay, this app is really good. The few shows I’ve seen on here are excellent (the office, grace and Frankie, you, etc.). HOWEVER there’s a very big problem. I’m 14 years old with extremely strict parents. They still don’t think I should have an adult account because they think it has too much inappropriate content (By the way, I watch all those shows with my brother on his account). As a result, I’m forced into a kids account which I don’t even use. A simple fix, as others have suggested, is a teen account! Movies and shows that are appropriate for teens and little to none kid’s content. I understand how difficult it would be to filter through every movie and show so meticulously, but this, I think, would be a game changer for parents on the fence about subscribing to Netflix, which would be a win-win for both us and you guys. So please consider it! ❤️"
2018-01-02 16:03:12,Thank you Netflix!,5,amaurer18,False,"Alright, I’m not gonna lie, I definitely am rating this app just for the sole purpose of thanking Netflix for bringing Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood back! But, it is definitely a great app, I must say. I like that you can download episodes and watch them wherever you are, and then delete them when you’re done so you aren’t taking up space or using data. Plus they have a decent selection of movies and shows, updating with new ones every month. I also love that it keeps track of where I am in the show, because sometimes I’ll forget if I have to leave in the middle of an episode. Overall, he fact that it doesn’t have ads and still has a good selection of shows and movies in high quality, I’d give it a 5 out of 5. And Netflix, you done good adding FMAB back to your banks. As a happy fan, I thank you! ❤️🙏🏻"

It is honestly the best movie/series app you could ever find. There are really no problems with this app. So then why am I writing this? Well it’s because of the statement you guys said. Anne with an E being canceled!! Like what?!?! I was furious. I’m being honest here if one of the best heartbreaking, breathtaking, captivating show is being canceled, then what should we expect about the others. Many fans have been pointing this out. I may be 1 person writing this, but about a million have my back. This isn’t a joke. This is garbage if you are gonna cancel this beautiful show. I know about the contract thingie, but at least try to not make it cancel. I love Netflix but if this is how you are gonna play then we should all quit our payments and switch to another app or cable!!!"

I absolutely love the fact that I can watch shows like Bordertown, the break, the fall, deadwind, fallet, borderliner, case, dark etc etc and I don’t mind the increase in price. However the layout is annoying and your ability to drop great shows is unsurpassed. I honestly use other streaming services for local programming and would never use Netflix if you didn’t have the overseas shows that I love, I also give props for the ability to in most of them listen in dubbed English, however I have not used that option for I don’t mind subtitles but my family members do not prefer them. I wish you got more for the money is how I feel. Maybe offer a pick and choose. I could care less about movies because you never have what I like anyway. I would pay a little more for more television series from another country. Other then that at least I have the few you do offer!!!"
2018-08-30 06:15:20,Bring Back Star Reviews,1,Thumbs Down Netflix,False,"Would have given this app a 4 out of 5 stars  review but it didn’t seem quite genuine since that’s not a thing you can do on the app itself. Why did star reviews go away? Who possibly thought that was a good idea? Was this just done to acquiesce to millenials’ short attention spans and lack of critical thinking skills? So much content on Netflix is deserving of 4 stars because it’s well imagined and executed but not exceptional. Or myriad other reasons. Some content should earn 2 stars because maybe it’s derivative or hampered by poor production values and while it doesn’t deserve a good rating it merits saying that it wasn’t awful. Or myriad other reasons. Some content you don’t regret having watched but it was definitely a waste of time. There’s the application for a 3 star review. Getting the most accurate feedback possible on your bank of great content would serve you best, regardless of what the data from whatever tests and studies led to this abomination of a decision said. Please keep creating and licensing great stuff and please bring back star reviews."
2020-05-27 18:05:32,Several flaws!  Big One:  Cannot rearrange your list!,2,AstroPaul,False,"We enjoy watching Netflix via our Roku, but the iPad app is woefully deficient. 

First, the search function often does NOT work.  The app sometimes hangs, it fails to find shows that are in the Netflix catalog, and just sits there doing nothing!  In contrast, Netflix via Roku works like a charm.

The app removes notifications if you back out of that screen!  Which means that if you inadvertently tap or try to delete a single one, you've lost any list of shows Netflix claims you like.  Ah!  Turns out that going back to notifications makes them show up again —why they vanished, however, is a mystery.

The tabs in the tab bar on the left side are too small, so it's too easy to hit the wrong choice.

—-> Worst of all, though, with the iPad app is that there seems to be no way of rearranging the shows in one's Watch List!

That needs fixing.  A drag-and-drop editing function would be the cat's meow!  On the web, it *seems* to have that ability, but it doesn't work!  Come on, developers, this is so basic, fix it!

By the way, Netflix's moving to thumbs up or thumbs down instead of a 5-star rating system is a MAJOR STEP BACKWARDS 

What was needed was to change the adjectives.  Several years back they offered a million dollar prize to improve their algorithm — which, curiously, was NEVER awarded!  Up-down is too simplistic and lacks the refinement needed to fine tune tastes and preferences."
2018-12-22 18:09:11,It’s amazing but.......,4,Angelica jaramillo 0412,False,"Netflix is a great app to enjoy movies and tv shows on phones, TVs, and many other electronic devices. I love how you can download movies or shows for on the go and it’s easy to find the type of genre you want to find in a show or movie. Although Netflix is very good, the process of adding and taking off movies/shows is something that really irritates me and many other people I know. I would like to enjoy many of the movies that were once on Netflix but they have been taken off. The only other way to see these beloved shows/ movies are to buy or rent them which is costly. I’m hoping that the people of Netflix can see this and maybe add back some of the old movies that were once on Netflix like Titanic and many other great films. Thank you and I’m begging to please add back some of the old movies like starstruck, and many other childhood movies plus Titanic. Thanks."

But there is ONE thing I think it’s lacking: anime. I’ve just kinda stopped using Netflix because there aren’t enough animes on it. There are SOME, but most of them aren't very good. I mean there are a FEW good ones on here (Attack on Titan, Sword Art Online, Violet Evergarden, ect.) But there aren’t very many good ones. I would love to see better ones. Also with the profile changes, I would LOVE IT if you could attach a password to your profile to change it, because my brother is always changing mine to dumb stuff. He always makes my name stupid, random, or just changes it all together. It annoys me a lot. Could you please add this? And maybe more anime profile pictures. If you could do any of these things, I would be very grateful, and I might even use Netflix more often."
2017-11-13 20:14:33,"Major iPhone X HDR problems, and notifications are annoying",1,Smak,False,"If you have the highest Netflix subscription (4 screens, hdr/4K streaming), and have this app configured to use “more data”, you should get HDR/Dolby vision quality for shows that support it (like stranger things, etc.).  

The problem is this app is crushing black levels for hdr shows, which turns a lot of darker scenes into mostly completely black blobs with no details.  It makes some shows unwatchable because you are missing all of the details in shadowy scenes.  Every scene from the “upside down” world in stranger things is affected by this bug, and season 2 is largely unwatchable until they fix it.  You miss too many details in anything that is underexposed in nearly every scene.  If you have an iPhone X, you should not watch anything in HDR until they fix this.

Also, app notifications cannot be customized enough.  This app should give you the ability to turn off notifications that aren't related to shows/movies on your list, e.g. Recommend movies that have nothing to do with your viewing habits."

Had to reset it. Within minutes I received a email saying I had logged in Malaysia! I live in the United States.

Where I was able to get on my account and see that there was another account, a account that I didn’t make! The following hour I received email that was asking for bitcoin, that the person had my email address and password along with my credit card number etc. weeks later all kinds of issues with that credit card. Netflix needs to something about the app where I am able to check my accounts. If you have the app and sign through the internet it will just kick you to the app where I can’t do anything!

Then, I would have to skip through every episode until the credits come on and the buttons come up saying watch next episode. Sometimes even that doesn’t work. I have three shows on my continue watching list that I don’t want to watch but can’t get it off of the list. It would be very nice if there was a button like the add to list button but it removes the show or movie from the continue watching list. I just thought I might bring this up because this annoys me."

What I mainly like about Netflix it the Anime section there’s tons of good anime like Naruto,Anohana,beastars, etc. but when i finished Naruto I wanted to watch Naruto shippuden (which You watch after completely finishing Naruto) but it’s wasn’t there. I’m not sure if this is true but apparently Netflix removed Naruto shippuden on USA Netflix but it’s still on german,India,etc version of Netflix. I’m still not sure of whether it’s true or not (like if it was there to begin with). I know I could always switch my vpn to Germany or India but that would only allow me to watch anime on my phone and in Japanese,I know that’s not bad but I prefer English. But besides that Netflix is great! And I use it everyday every chance I get. If Netflix were able to add naruto shippuden that would be great!"

I started looking into shows and found most boring, until I came around select few this year or years before such as, Atypical, I am not ok with this, parks and rec, and never have I ever. All shows I have enjoyed and rewatched, exited the see new seasons. This year netflix came out with the hit  original that I personally didn't enjoy, “Kissing booth2” which was such a hit they decided a third movie should air. I don’t mind new movies being made, expect when they cancel about six to seven shows. I also don’t understand why shows which are popular, such as all the ones I mentioned are getting cancelled. Netflix, I love you, but I’m tired of this. I will be unsubscribing, along with others who I know will be too for this reason, if you guys don’t realize a kissing booth three is less important then 6-7 shows that will make you more money all together, I’m done with Netflix for good."
2018-07-17 14:31:43,Parental controls need work,3,thompson2003,False,"Let me start by saying I really enjoy netflix and have subscribed for as long as I can remember. With that being said the parental controls stink. I don’t watch rated r or mature movies/ tv shows as a personal choice. I’m a grown adult but I don’t think extreme gore, violence, and sexual content is good for you mind so I don’t watch it. If you do, no judgment but I want control over what I or my child sees. Unfortunately Netflix doesn’t allow me to filter the stuff out that I’m not interested in at all. Sure, I can set things up to force a password but the preview picture and or quick clip of the movie are just as bad as watching it! If the purpose of parental control is to remove those things from an impressionable mind then showing a preview of it is not exactly a good thing. Surely it can’t be that hard to set a control where if a program is rated r or m that they just remove it from view. Please consider this netflix..."
2018-03-06 01:44:54,Love it. Just a few errors,3,Gjvrhbcg,False,"Okay, Netflix is great in my opinion. It’s just that sometimes I hate it! 
1. So whenever you watch a show you have to wait for like a year for the next season or more episodes to come. Which I absolutely think you guys should speed things up a bit more! For example Riverdale. Riverdale only has one season out on Netflix but on like C & W there’s season 2 and I bet even the other seasons which just isn’t fair.

2. Netflix has shows and movies. Some good some bad. But mostly bad other than good it’s really hard to find a good movie or show. There isn’t even Cinderella or the classic Disney movies. Which you guys should add in all the classics. 

3. Stop taking out movies! All the movies you guys take out are good movies. All the bad movies stay on Netflix. This movie.. a great movie called The Boy In The Striped Pajamas. Which was the most sad movie I have ever watched. The most heart warming and heart breaking. It’s probably my favorite true story that ended up in a movie and it’s just not fair it got taken off of Netflix like the other good movies. It should come to an end. Lots of people have different movie opinions and I understand you guys are trying to put good movies in and bad out. But you all are doing the oppisite.

Those are just my errors. I hope you guys understand why I hate these three features on Netflix and therefore I hope they get fixed."

A.More Environmental shows,
We really need more shows and movies on eco-sustainability and ecotourism, cause our lives matter and we all should have a part in helping ourselves and each other, a show that I am super proud that Netflix put on there is “Down to Earth”, awesome, funny, and a life rethinker, it is my favourite show and to anyone reading this, PLZ WATCH IT.
B.Less strange teenager shows, most of them have no life lessons and they take up valuable space.
          Other then these two things 👍🏼, but plz put the A advise on there, I would really appreciate it, thank you very much, love you Netflix, and #better then Disney!"
2019-11-28 05:56:29,PLZ READ!!,4,lizard 🧚🏽‍♀️,False,"This is a second part.  So I found out they are 2 days away from taking COCO off from Netflix.  I love that movie, it’s so heart warming and I was hoping to watch it with my family on Christmas and in the future but I guess we won’t be able to.  I’m so upset but if it’s because of some contract thing I would really appreciate if you can get it back.  This is a beautiful cultural and happy movie and I feel like it can be related to so many people.

(The Pretty Little Liers part is from a while back but I also would LOVE to have it back 🙂)

Hey I’m writing this cuz I wanted to finish watching Pretty Little Liars and Im only on SEASON 2 and their is 7 SEASONS!!  Why are u taking it off? It’s a GREAT AMAZING SHOW and now ur taking it off 🤦🏾‍♀️.  And what’s up with some movies not being on Netflix, I REALLY REALLY wanted to watch IT and other scary movies but they arnt on here.  Can you plz make some changes"
2019-02-09 22:34:21,"Great app, bad employees",4,Kayla8989001,False,"Netflix is great. I love watching the shows and movies. They are no longer those times where the shows get really pixelated for no reason, but I was having some issues with the account settings. There used to be a link to the website from the profile settings page, but it’s no longer there and the call button is, so I pressed that. 

He asked for my name and email and after I said those, I said, ""I need help—"" and he interrupted with, ""Obviously, I know. That’s why you called the help line."" He was extremely rude about it. What I was TRYING to say was, ""I need help with the settings because it says that I can’t edit the other profiles.""

I love using the app and I think that people should definitely get it, but if you have any problems with Netflix, try another friend first and make calling customer service a last resort."
2019-06-03 18:01:33,Best to Worst,1,_KEM_,False,"With every update they make the user experience worse on the streaming devices like Apple TV. 

The annoying auto-preview blaring sound and video when trying to scan for new programs with no option to turn it off. This slows down the UI and is constantly trying to play a preview.  If I want to see/hear a preview I will select it.  

The updated show rating system is horrible.  Previously you had a five star rating system and now they ""improved"" that to thumb-up/thumb-down only rating which offers us no way to rate a show at all.  Many of the programs I watch on Netflix just don't deserve either a thumb-up or down rather something in the middle but we have lost all of the flexibility when rating programs. This is very frustrating to me because very few programs I watch can be described to others or to the recommendation algorithm Netflix uses to determine what shows to recommend to me when I look for future programming.

These are just two examples of changes they have made that have made the service less desirable to use.

I have contacted them about these and many of the other changes they have made to the UI with no results.  Over the last few years far more of the changes they have made using the service worse instead of better.  I've found myself using Netflix less and less and one of the competing services more and more.  If they continue on this path much longer I plan to cancel my subscription."
2018-06-01 01:18:47,Mostly Great,4,#AnnieBflippin7,False,"This is a great app for all ages. There are movies for kids, teens, and adults. Some you can even download and watch on the go which is great for children. I only have one complaint. As a teen, when I get into a show, I watch it in any free time I have. That means that I can finish a show pretty quickly. Netflix is great, but it has resentful taken a lot of the shows off that kids and teens love. Even if you take them off, Netflix is really bad at updating shows. The new seasons come out on Netflix a year after they were released and it takes forever for new shows and movies to appear. For the past few months, I’ve been watching the same things over and over again. I think that Netflix should update on their movies and shows a little better. Other than that, I love Netflix and hope that this might be able to be changed."

Mostly I love to watch all kinds even though I tried some and I even watched them over and over again. Lots of people say that this kind of app is interesting and fine. I like these kinds of movies because well...you know sometimes I would like to go in the living room at my house and watching these silly cartoons. After all, I didn't know I would be doomed. My entertainment was getting bigger each day. Since I couldn't go to school on the weekends I'd watch movies in Netflix. Still, I never stopped watching since it is fun. It was also mostly good except all the long, boring updates. Huh, though I hope this app would never end!

I was in love in it, too.

2017-12-26 15:44:22,Pretty Good,4,pojdjd,False,"I keep having this annoying bug where the screen blacks out. It’s infuriating me because it every five or so seconds. Everything else is fine. They have a pretty good catalog with movies for almost all. For tweens I would say not enough superheroe cartoons. These cartoons consist of Teen Titans(Go) or Young Justice( a show that has been recently pulled out from the catalog). Also I wish somehow instead waiting a year for the season to come we could wait six months. My parents wish that there was two more things, privacy and rating. My guardians would like some privacy because they don’t want me to snoop on what they are watching. The rating system is ok. But I think they should go back to the five stars rating process. If it is not available on mobile devices. Then at least on the television.
I hope Netflix could but my dreams in reality.

In my continue watching list, I see shows that I’ve never even started watching and there is no control to take shows or movies off the continue watching list. Another problem, which is the one that finally pushed me to write this review, is the one about to many people currently watching on this account. Honestly, this one isn’t even true. I was watching a show when it suddenly says that some one is watching gossip girls, thirteen reasons why, arrested development, and love on an iPhone, smart tv, and a computer. I check all the devices in the house. My tv isn’t even on and no one else was even currently watching Netflix at that time. It’s annoying and that’s why this only gets four stars.😒"

Now the reason I hate Netflix is because there is a show called the cuties and it is so inappropriate and another thing I hate about Netflix even though I am 10 I think it’s not good that from a kids account you can easily go to a regular account so like if a 5 year old was watching Netflix she could easily switch from a kid account to a regular account so I think you should put a passcode to go into a regular account so put a passcode and PLEASE REMOVE “ THE CUTIES “ PLEASE I am begging 🥺 you if you don’t then I will DELETE Netflix

2020-05-25 21:58:09,"Way overrated, disappointed and dissatisfied, but I can help!",3,K❤️C💜,False,"Back in like 2018 Netflix was amazing. But now, it seems like it’s down grading A LOT! I’m very disappointed. But I don’t wanna just complain, so I have a few things that’ll make Netflix more likable and better! Because c’mon! It’s 2020! So first I think that there should be some kind of parental controls. And I know your probably rolling your eyes but I think that it’s vey important. Also you should add more icons for each watchers liking. And while we’re on the topic of the watcher, we need more of them. My family had 8 people which is a lot and we all need our OWN Netflix profile but the limit is five which makes me sad. And you should totally make a section dedicated to teenagers because there are kids which is kinda cute adults with lots of cussing and well - adult stuff. But there’s that awkward section in the middle! You should do better! Just some suggestions!"
2018-11-24 23:20:37,"Decent app, but a few problems",3,>~kate•~>,False,"This is a pretty nice app as far as I can tell, for I only got it yesterday, but I already have an issue. I added a few shows I know I’d be watching and even watched a few episodes last night, today I opened the app and went to my list and nothing was there, it was empty so I was like, “okay, maybe it just didn’t save,” and I went to search and pulled up one of my shows, and it said it was already added to my list but when I went to see again, it wasn’t.
Secondly, it’s not a big deal, but it does kind of bother me how this app is supposedly a “binge watch” ordeal, and yet some shows (that have been completely released for a few years at least) aren’t even complete in availability on the app- there’s only like one or two seasons or worse, only a few episodes for a few seasons...
If that of which present in the aforementioned was fixed, this app would be golden."
2020-02-04 20:03:18,Great app but needs tweak,4,SeanGerlis,False,"I enjoy Netflix as anyone does. My only pet peeve is, whenever I download the videos stored on my i0S, it is only accessible when your profile is actively set/used. The saved video won’t play if your profile is not enabled. Sometimes the app forces me to re-select the profile after not using the app. Whenever and wherever I’m in without any wifi/internet access, I couldn’t select my profile thus my saved videos will not be playable because the profile is not enabled. This alone defeats the point of having saved videos to be playable when you are without internet access. Netflix should consider enabling profile without being dependent to internet. They can set the profile to check the server once the internet access is valid before the profile kicks one out with rationale. Not the other way around."
2018-05-31 01:06:19,New Update Is Not Working,1,GabeTheTorchic,False,"So I LOVE Netflix, so I’m not gonna dog on much, but this review needs to be seen, like RIGHT NOW! I tried to get on this morning and instead of it loading my profile, it just brought up a black screen with loading dots. I tried to restart my phone and then deleted the app, thinking I could just log back in when I downloaded the app again. I was surprisingly wrong. I went back into the app, and put in my account information to be surprised with an error saying I had put in the wrong information. To my dismay I redid the information, being meticulous about it as I typed it, and it STILL did not work. I have 5 episodes of Riverdale left. 5! I went to the website, and as a final check to make sure I wasn’t going crazy, I tried to log in, and it worked! I went back to the app, bud sadly it didn’t work. I called support, and whereas the guy was nice, since I’m not the owner of the account and my mom is, he could not do much. I would love to finish Riverdale before Sunday, so this issue needs to be addressed right now!"

One of the shows I want to see the second season for is Unlisted. It’s SO good. So plse add more seasons??? Also I just started Zoom for the second time after this review, and when I saw the “adventures” Team Zenith had pre-dark concussion, I was interested in them. So maybe you could add some kind of hour long episode show about their “adventures”? * hour long cause I finish shows pretty quickly*
This part of my review is after I saw the news for Green Eggs and Ham. THANK YOU for answering my calls and adding more   seasons!

2020-08-07 17:41:39,The best thing to watch 😍 but...,4,Ngengi101,False,"I love Netflix, but as you can see I only gave it four out of five stars. It’s because when you put on a show you either put all of the seasons, but not all of the episodes. Or you just put 1 season but it’s not season one. I’m very annoyed of that. Why not start from season one, and put all of the episodes? Don’t get me wrong Netflix is the best place to watch shows and movies but seriously? Also you take of shows and movies that are really good and add movies that are either too old for me, or to young for me. Please think of that middle-ish age group. The only shows that I like that I like come out 4 or 3 times a year. Some of which I just rewatch because most of these shows and movies or not for my typical age group or are to boring. Also you took of some really good movies like the infinite war and black panther."

2018-09-30 21:42:45,Knock it off already! Stop preview autoplay!,1,TheRealJunipurr,False,"The autoplay for previews when you browse is beyond annoying!! To make it worse, it will often start playing the previews even when I am watching something else. I have to quit out of my show, go to the home screen and scroll down until the preview can no longer be seen to stop it. Then I have to open up the show I was watching again. It seems to happen most when I allow the autoplay for next episodes. If I click the next episode before the autoplay timer finishes, this doesn’t seem to happen. Please give the option to TURN OFF AUTOPLAY ON THE HOME/BROWSE SCREEN!!!! (There aren’t enough exclamation points in the world to express my feelings about this). You know it’s annoying. You know people don’t like it. Is it that you just don’t care? Is there anyone who has called up and said, “Thank you so much for making me watch these previews!

2018-01-31 12:44:44,"Good app, terrible support.",3,gschneyer,False,"Every third or fourth update the app developers remove the ability for the app to work when there isn’t a WiFi signal. Currently if no WiFi signal exists it has an error message telling of this, but then doesn’t allow to pass, just loops. How do I watch the downloaded shows in say an air flight? Before the latest update what I would have to do is watch when I’m practically under my router, but go to my bedroom where it dips only one bar and playing even a downloaded file it just sits and sits trying to connect to the WiFi. The solution was to put in airplane mode and it played immediate. Now it just goes through that error. I know, I’ll send a bug report..... oh, the app has no feature to email the developers of problems. So both these issues needs to be addressed, the network problem and a means for users to give the developers hints, suggestions, and bug reports."

I love how you can decorate your profile picture but I do wish you could MAKE your own profile picture, maybe next update? Also we need more sections. Like teens, older people, grownups, toddlers, and older kids. I have to share a profile with my brother and he is only 2 and I’m almost 8. But the only way to make this work for my family is if you let people have more than 6 profiles because I have to share a account with my aunt and grand parents so not ONLY I have to share a profile with my brother but I NEED to share one with my COUSIN TO. So maybe you can let people have up to 10 profiles? Otherwise I LOVE this app! I recommend I just needs a few things to be fixed."

Because if I’m being honest and it’s probably only me but I’m getting tired of seeing all this new shows and movies that come out on Netflix and their so bad and not interesting or entertaining at all because have way into the show or movie I just stop because it loses my interest right away. If Netflix wants more people to start using its app they better start putting better movies and shows. I’m not saying this because I’m trying to hate on Netflix, I’ve seen many shows and movies that I have thought I would never, every watch but was so wrong in the end!

2020-03-06 22:37:25,More Movies and sections,4,Carli ❤️,False,"Hi, Netflix is great in all if it has your shows, they don’t have that many shows. I think that maybe Netflix should add more older movies instead of all new ones. I rarely find old movies. Some movies I think you should add is, Dirty Dancing, The Outsiders, Karate Kid, and that’s just to name a few. I also think Netflix should add other sections like for teens or for the elderly because like mine and many parents, they won’t let there kids have adult account because they have some shows/ movies that are rated R but if you make a section for teens, all the teens won’t have to watch kiddy cartoons, they could watch pg-13. I think you should make a section for the elderly and put old movies that you can’t find anywhere.

2018-08-09 03:23:16,Good but needs improvement,4,Emma |-/,False,"Netflix has always been my go to movie app, but lately it seems like such a hassle to find something to watch. Not to mention that the most recent updates have kind of sent Netflix down the gutter. I really enjoyed being able to see a rating for each selection out of five stars, and I also enjoy being able to input my own rating rather than just a thumbs up or thumbs down. Another setback, on mobile devices when selecting a movie or show to watch, you are not met with a description but rather tags for what the movie has to offer, such as “vampire” or “girl power”. For me, that isn’t enough to decide whether I want to watch something or not. Netflix, I implore and beg of you, please bring back the star ratings and the selection descriptions. It would make your watchers much happier."

There's always something to watch and in addition to all of the content from various sources, you also get access to Netflix original programs. The value I get from the service is well worth the price. Even though the subscription rates were recently increased, you're still getting a lot for your money. In my humble opinion, Netflix is better than any cable or satellite TV service on the planet and offers way more bang for your buck. Of all the bills I pay at the end of the month, this is the one bill that I have no hesitation or remorse in paying. The developers of the app and everyone involved with making it are to be commended for thier hard work. I can't speak for anyone else, but personally, I am one very happy customer!"

I have never had any problems and I am always notified when and where people are logging into the account to protect from fraud. I just believe there are a few things you could add for a more pleasurable experience. For example, I get recommendations based off of movies I rated as a dislike, and movies that say I would only enjoy 10% have come to be some of my favorite, so maybe work on trying to get some kinks out of it to make the Netflix personalized to the person better. Also you guys should add an option to remove movies and shows from the continue watching bar. If I start a season and don’t end up liking it I am stuck looking at it in my bar until it gets so full i just create a new profile. Overall great work!"

Repeated all of these same steps again with Netflix support just now. Same result. They finally tell me there will be an update to fix this. I tried the Netflix app on my iPhone X and it works fine using version 10.8.0. My iPad just updates last night to 10.9.0. 
I try to tell support that the update broke it and I am trying to explain this to her and she keeps telling me she can’t answer questions about Apple only Netflix. I try to explain to her that I am talking about Netflix and all she can say is wait a week and use your browser. I then tried to explain to her you cannot use Safari to watch Netflix because it wants to dump you into the broken app. Her response to this was to use another device. Wait, remind me again did my bill just go up or down for this poor service that does not know what she is doing and I cannot use on my primary device?

Update: Now after automatic updates updated my iPhone X, it is broken too."
2019-06-19 22:21:20,Needs more movies,5,love it butt,False,Over all I love Netflix In fact I’m proberbly on it to much but there are some things that would be nice to add. First of all I’ve watched all the movies and almost all the tv shows. So it would be nice to change it up. Also can you put in big movies like Harry Potter or Star Wars.  Because I love most of the movies but right now I’m in a really big Harry Potter phase and I looked and looked and looked but know Harry Potter. I am even think omg about deleting Netflix and downloading something with cooler movies. So please put on Harry Potter. And I know there’s ways to buy movies or something but my mom said she is NOT paying any money. So please put on Harry Potter . Me and my friends all said we wish Netflix had some cooler movies. So take what I said into consideration. But again over all I think it’s a great app.
2019-07-24 03:51:58,Kinda annoying sometimes,4,annoyed young child,False,"Now don’t get me wrong. I love Netflix and I probably always will. But one thing that really annoys me is that sometimes shows will pop up on my account and I start watching them. I find them really interesting but then for some reason or another sometimes I have to exit out of the app. Then when I go back to watch the show again, it won’t pop up. I’ll search for it and it just won’t be there anymore. So I go onto my moms account to see if it pops up there and it just magically is. I have a kids account so obviously there are limits to what you can watch. But the shows are PG and I should be able to watch them. And if they pop up, you’d expect them to stay there until Netflix takes it off. But if I’m in the middle of an episode and it just randomly disappears I’m going to get kinda mad."
2019-06-08 07:31:26,Awesome app but..,3,Spottipickle,False,"It’s awesome to watch all sorts of genres and good movies as well as some not so good ones. The only thing I’m complaining about is that they get rid of some movies after awhile but I feel like and probably others would like to watch those movies or shows again. It would be awesome if there was a survey or something to vote on which movies to get rid off and if there is that then awesome you are one step ahead but other then that it’s great to watch shows you enjoy and stuff.
     I also think that maybe you could add more movies to certain genres and stuff like some of the anime there’s a few that are pretty good but there are so many more that you have not added that are awesome and some other movies and personally I kind of dislike when you add a second movie or third but never had done the first cause when you watch those movies you can easily get confused."
2018-08-07 03:27:04,It slowly keeps getting worse,2,Trevor Lawless,False,"Hey netflix,
 so i don’t know anything about the the shows or movies i’m trying to watch now. On mobile you guys got rid of star ratings and replaced it with thumbs system which isn’t preferable but overall not a huge deal then you guys got rid of descriptions and replaced it with tags. So now all i know about a movie before i watch are things like: “British”, “Showbiz”, “Fight the System”, “Los Angeles”, and etc. These are not helpful to my decision making process when i want to watch something, so can you fix that by just using your old system which worked well. i would like to point out that i appreciate that you guys are trying new things but realize not all change is good. Oh and also why does your movie selection seem to get worse and worse. Like you guys used to have almost movies i could think of watching now its mainly blockbuster action movie and romcoms so just a little more variety and selection."
2020-03-17 20:43:51,Where is all american?,5,Rice-Pudding,False,"I personally love Netflix I can’t live without it. It’s one of my favorite things to do and one of my favorite show is all american. A couple minutes ago I got a notification on my phone saying that season 2 is now out so I went on netflix and didn’t see it so I searched it up and still didn’t see it so I was confused and decided to go onto safari and see if it really was out and there was a page saying that it was so I thought it could maybe be an update that I missed and that was the reason why so I went to the App Store to check for updates and it said I needed to update it so I did and even after that it still was not on and o searched it up again and it wasn’t on so I’m really confused and I just want to know if it’s out or not. 

Thanks"
2019-11-03 16:46:12,I love it but there are problems,4,Docgibby,False,"I love this so much! It kinda saved me... BUT I HAVE ISSUES!!! *Sigh* Sadly, I live in Germany and I have to use the German Netflix instead of America Netflix so some of the tv shows that I watch (Anime) are in German or Japanese (This includes Audio and subtitles!) So half of the anime’s that look interesting I can’t even watch, cause I can’t understand it! Also, This is very important to my problems, I HATE IT WHEN THEY DON’T PUT ON ALL THE SEASONS TO A TV SHOW!!! The tv show that I watch (Miraculous ladybug + Cat noir) only has the 1 season and half of the 2. This really annoys me that I can’t watch all the seasons. So please, put on all seasons and make it a little fair by at least putting in English Audio in MOST tv shows. Be fair to ALL AMERICANS, no matter where they live😉 (Also I recommend putting on the TV show “FariyTail” it’s really good!) 
Thank you for your time."
2018-10-17 07:37:13,Voiceover is broken on the tvOS side,1,Themusicman08,False,"I hope someone will take the time and read this review very very carefully.
I am a user of voiceover on the AppleTV and Netflix. When I show is played in 5.1 surround sound, I noticed that the split screen option no longer works. What I mean is this, if one episode of a show is going off while the credits are rolling, in the top left corner, on the bottom right corner, you would see the next episode, it’s synopsis, and what it is about. Voiceover used to work with this very very well. It no longer works at all. I have tried to contact customer service for almost 2 years and have complained about this problem. It sounds like to me in my personal opinion, that you want to lose customers. If I’m wrong, then please prove me wrong by fixing this feature. I have contacted Apple and have gone through the necessary steps to talk to them in Apple accessibility hotline. Now, the ball is in your court. Please fix voiceover on the Apple TV and your app so that they will work without any problems."
2018-09-29 07:56:07,Needs more shows,2,Yeneshin,False,"Although I did enjoy Netflix there are many shows I just couldn’t find. No matter what anime I search I only get like.. what nine? And some of these people aren’t interested in watching. I don’t know if it’s just me, but I couldn’t find say AOT/SNK or Tokyo Ghoul or Darling in the franXX or something. And movies like transformers: the last knight (something I really wanted to see after hearing so much hate on) and that really angered me. Would love if you would expand the list :)

Edit: just discovered AOT/SNK and deadman wonderland and Fairy Tail were removed by Netflix. May I ask WHY?! I mean some people came here for anime and AOT is a fan favorite and on the top of everybody’s list. It needs more anime and needs the old ones back. I’m really disappointed by this!

None of the things I want are on Netflix and I really want to love it!!! Why does it pain everyone if they just left the shows where they are? It’s frustrating! Please PLEASE fix this! And give me my attack on Titan back! 🙏🙏🙏"
2018-07-31 00:10:35,Critical Uninstall and Reinstall + Restart Required,3,Droppedbeat,False,"Netflix fails to mention that a fresh install of the app or update of the app will work.  You MUST register your account, UNISTALL Netflix app, RESTART phone, reinstall Netflix App, restart phone, then sign in and cross your fingers.  This is your best bet.  Netflix and T-Mobile like to make believe that their technology works and is bug free.  Not true.  Not by a long shot.  I tried originally a few weeks ago and T-Mobile was “unable to process my request” due to a system error.  I’ve had nothing but errors and mishaps since enrolling with T-Mobile a few months ago, including signup, activation, billing, reimbursement from Sprint, all of the above.  TMobile has a LONG way to go with customer service and accuracy.  I give them an A for attitude but a D for execution on all fronts.  Get it together guys.  It’s frustrating and discouraging to be dependent on inept leadership.  Good luck."
2020-06-29 02:10:51,Just why-...,5,"please, just please..",False,"Okay I overally love netflix and stilm use it everyday, but you legit just get rid of the bestest shows that more poeple like, just like Pokemon Y and Z, so many people love it and all, and it even was my favorite, and it still is. I've managed to keep calm and not report a bad review on netflix, but bruh can you not realise even people are making videos of Y and Z and stuff about why they deleted it, THIS is why you can't, no you DON'T deserve a 5/5 review, if YOU guys didn't remove all those movies you would have a 5/5 star review till this day, and if you use "" not enough space"" as a excuse, why can't you just say you have a 2nd netflix so people don't get angry and give bad reviews like me, if you have another excuse I might forgive you and give it a lot better star review, please respond."
2020-06-25 21:26:12,Had this app since I was little! 💕❤️,5,CorgiPopz🐶,False,"I am a kid writing this review. All I can say about this app, is that it’s amazing! I watch movies or series every month looking for something! My favorite series on Netflix is Alexa and Katie! I recently started watching Season 4 and finished all 3 seasons a couple months ago which is crazy! I do recommend Netflix, and it holds a ton if amazing content to discover. I am looking forward to future updates+new movies,series, and shows that will keep me entertained and make the app WAY better than it is now! I had this basically half of my life and I have it installed on my iPhone. Netflix is one of those apps which has low ratings but turns out it’s a great app! I recommend Netflix if you want to get entertained, especially during this quarantine! ❤️"
2017-10-22 21:13:33,Mostly good,3,CaptCatholic,False,"I would rate this app 5 Star, and I will rate it five star if the following issue gets fixed. I am in the navy, when I’m out to sea I don’t have any internet connection. This app used to be great for downloading a few movies or a show and watching it while out to sea. The show would expire after so long which I which I thought was reasonable. The last time that I went underway, several of my coworkers and I would open the app and get sent to the login screen immediately. With no internet connection it is impossible to login. As I said, this was not an issue in the past and has to be because of something in an update over the last month or so. I used to not have to login every time I opened the app without internet connection. This is an important feature to me because of my job and until this feature is fixed I can not rate more than 3 stars"
2017-09-21 06:03:57,I do not want certain titles showing up in my Netflix.,3,Italian_beatle,False,"This might seem like a petty thing, but we used to be able to rate shows and movies with a one to five star rating which would eventually tailor our Netflix recommendations to our specific viewing habits, and separate shows that we would never watch.

I know that I watch a lot of anime, but that doesn't mean I need to see every friggin' ""My Little Pony"" title staring at me each time I open the app. And just because I like Jim Gaffigan does not mean I like the comedic stylings of Chelsea Handler. If I never saw her mug on my television screen ever again, it would make me oh-so-happy!

If I could block certain titles (i.e. crap documentaries like ""life after porn"") or give a big ol' thumbs up to my favorite flicks, I'd love this app so much more. Why you took away the rating system is beyond me. Maybe to placate movie executives who were outraged at the one and a half star rating for Halle's ""Catwoman""... I don't know why, but it's a dumb decision.

Also, giving a title the ""thumbs down"" doesn't stop it from showing up in the popular section of Netflix. I am sick of scrolling by dozens of shows I have no interest in, just to find a decent flick.

Please consider changing this so we can tailor the site how we want, not by some algorithm that clearly doesn't know what's good for us. Thank you."
2019-07-15 08:24:56,"Good, but needs more improvement",4,daMuddler,False,"Netflix is great. It has shows and movies for kids and adults, a wide variety of stuff for watching, and adding new stuff every once in a while. But it’s not perfect.

For starters, there’s only a handful of kids tv shows that actually have all the Seasons. Shows that really draws kids’ attention, like Steven Universe and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, only show 1 or 2 Seasons. And if you’re thinking “jeez man the later Seasons will come out sometime, be patient.”, shut up, because I’ve been “Patient” for 2 years! Also, there’s waaaaaaay to many shows and movies being replaced with Netflix Originals. No one watches them!!!!!!1!1!1!!!1

So it is far from perfect, but it surely Beats out stuff like Apple TV and Tubi where it’s pay to watch. I don’t have much else to say except that it’s much better than average, but far from perfect."
2019-06-27 17:56:26,I like this app,5,kittycat201125,False,Netflix is really good but I have a idea for the people who made Netflix so instead of them talking a lot of shows of they should have a show and and make 5 seasons and then  still have that show and then upgrade that show and then make a new show that of the same people but make the show a little different and keep these two shows so people can keep watching it and watching it  like what I’m trying to say is let’s pretend that there was a show called yes  and then they still keep the show and then they make a other show about the same people and still keep the other show so people can watch both this is just a idea the people who work on Netflix and change the shows well here is a idea! I love Netflix now bye😁
2019-09-05 10:34:06,Just listen,5,lily957,False,So I put two stars to get someone’s attention but like why can’t Netflix bring back Voltron like the ending was so GOOD you can’t even understand stand but I wanna see more. It’s not even like I want is like I need I can’t stop thinking about it and it was such a great show and I need to see more like what happens if in years there becomes someone evil and Voltron is needed again or just some back ground to everything that would happen after everything. Oh yeah and I was excited to see and baby altean/human by lance and allura but then the whole thing of here leaving everything and giving herself so everyone else could live ❤️ and then lance just thinking about her for his whole life makes me cry like this is the BEST show so can Netflix just at least one more episode
2018-07-29 21:00:13,Please add “Want to Watch” list!!,4,JadaaLol,False,"I absolutely love Netflix...they have an amazing range of movies and shows to pick from and a lot of the Netflix originals are 100x better than the shows on the regular TV. however, there is ooooone teeny tiny thing I feel like would make the app 10x better! Netflix, please add a “Want to Watch” list! I know there’s already a My List, but I feel like that should be reserved for shows you already watch. Sometimes I’ll be scrolling on Netflix and see an interesting show/movie that I think looks good but I don’t want to watch at that very second. Instead of forgetting about the show because I didn’t start watching it as soon as I saw it, I wish I could just add it to a list to watch it later. So that way, as soon as I open Netflix it’s right there, reminding me how interesting it looks."
2020-10-04 23:07:16,A few suggestions...,4,Popstar186,False,"I have a few suggestions that would help the app a lot.
1. IT NEEDS HARRY POTTER!!! I am a Harry Potter addict. I would love a way to watch the movies for free, I am sure other people would too. (PLEASE I AM DYING TO WATCH MEH FAVE MOVIES)
2. Some of the content on the kids shows and movies.... I have tried so many shows, and some of them should definitely not be on the kids selections. Maybe make a teenager category to put the shows in? But as long as they are removed from the eyes of youngsters, it’s cool😎. Shows like Haters Back Off, Fuller House, and others I cannot think of off the top of my head.
3. Wider selections of kid’s shows. I am 11 years old, and my parents still make me use the kids category. MORE SITCOMS!!! I have seen Alexa and Katie, Sam and Cat, Victorious, etc.... I need more. Like, please! I am getting bored of scrolling through baby shows!"
2017-10-29 16:34:58,Love Netflix but..,4,LLCoolDane,False,"I personally love Netflix. Yes the thumbs up and thumbs down way of rating is way too simplistic, if you ask a critic what they think of a show or film they aren’t going to just say like or dislike, they’re going to give you a spiel as to what they liked and didn’t like. 

However my main reasoning for coming to write this review; who writes the captions? Seriously, I couldn’t tell you how many times I’ve seen words that are just completely wrong and out of context. If it’s just a program I completely get it but if a deaf person or someone in a business that can’t have the sound up too high is watching, they’re going to see “it’s going to be a phone one”.... what?
Main character’s name is Ryan, always has his name said several times typically close together in one episode but says Bryan a couple times. 
Like I said if it’s a program I get it, but if someone is actually captioning these shows they’re doing a poor job of paying attention lol..

This will never be enough reason for me to stop using Netflix I just felt that it should be said for those who never have a chance to hear and will always be like “a phone one? What?”

Netflix paid how much for Friends but can’t have quality captioning? C’mooooooooon ;p"
2020-09-10 17:49:41,MORE JULIE AND THE PHANTOMS 👻,5,syffsffftsfysft,False,"omg I love this Netflix production it’s the best one yet keep up the good work and pls add more seasons I wanna know what happens with the guys and especially Julie with Lukas omg I totally feel the chemistry I LOVE THIS SHOW I know it just came out today but if I’m totally being honest I woke up extra early just to watch Julie and the  phantoms it’s so good ima recommend it to all of my friend and another reason why u should make another season is BECAUSE I NEED TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENS WITH JULIE AND NICK Im just so happy right now I love this show it’s the greatest show ever to happen on Netflix before this show my favorite Netflix movie was the Christmas prince I love it by the way and now I’m literally in love with Julie and the phantoms it’s the best of the best keep up the great work Netflix

2018-08-31 07:56:13,Terrible connectivity!,2,Smartshop50,False,"While I do enjoy the selections that are offered most of the time, it seems as though there are far more vulgar, sci-fi, and horror movies in which I have no interest whatsoever. I think you need to select more wholesome family orientated options. It would be very nice if Netflix would make more original series’s with out being full of unnecessary gratuitous foul language.
It would also be very nice if it would connect far more often than it does. I find I can spend the length of a hour long series just trying to get a connection and keep a connection to be able to view anything. In areas of low service Netflix can be useless. As of August 31 it seems as though the recent update has made connectivity far far worse. Won’t connect for multiple tries (like dozens!) on both my laptop as well as my iPhone. And don’t even ask about my Kindle!   Netflix doesn’t give a darn about working on Kindles!"
2018-05-04 19:29:58,TAKE MY WORD FOR THIS!!!!!!,3,fixthesedjkskzis,False,"I use Netflix almost everyday. I only use it to watch tv shows though. There is no good movies at all. You have thousands of movies and films but they are all stupid. Nobody watches them. They are just sucky movies. Why don’t you have movies people watch? Popular movies. Pitch Perfect is a great example. You need popular movies. I spend almost all my weeks going through all your categories trying to find a movie but they are all terrible. Bad acting and just so not popular. You have only “kid” Disney movies. You could have so much more business if you had a better movie selection. It just makes me so mad that you don’t. None of the hunger games, maze runner, divergent. Those are all popular series and you don’t even have them? Do you not want to make money or something. All I watch on Netflix is tv shows. It gets boring. Put some good, popular movies. Please"
2018-03-13 05:06:38,Obnoxious “features”,1,thisnicknameistakensdfsdfsdf,False,"Rather than make a user-friendly app, Netflix wants to be as in-your-face as possible.  Here are some of its app’s obnoxious “features”.

(1) When you open the app, you are greeted with an advertisement—for some show / movie that you never wanted to watch—that covers literally 90% of your screen.  They refuse even to show you the entire icon of any other show that might be on your list; that row of icons is pushed so far down to the bottom that their bottom half is pushed off the screen.

(2) The app plays a preview—with *sound*—of any show or movie that is highlighted.  That means that if you want silence, you should quit the app, rather than just stay where you are.

(3) The app does not care what you were just watching the last time you used it.  Ot does not put that show or movie front and center, where you can continue watching with one tap.  Instead, you have to hunt for it.

(4) The app doesn’t even order its categories (rows) in the same way from one use to the next.  Again, this forces you to hunt through its rows to find the show you were literally just watching.

(5) Netflix refuses to let Apple TV’s TV app access its data.  To watch a Netflix show, you are forced to use the Netflix app, with its problems 1-4 listed above.

Netflix: if you wanted to get users to like your app, you’ve failed.  If you wanted to get users to hate your app (and, by extension, you), you’ve succeeded."
2020-06-05 15:50:46,Teen section (and other things)!!!!,3,slothie11,False,"So I know a lot of the content on Netflix are original series, but a lot of them say they are for teens even though they aren’t even teen appropriate. They don’t really have anything that are actually relatable for teens. I also think you should add a lot of more throwbacks and teen movies that aren’t rated-R. A lot of the movies are either kids movies or movies that parents would watch when your kids go to sleep. There are teen movies that are rated PG-13, but they mostly have adult humor and those are movies that aren’t really that great. Also, I love the original series on Netflix, but all the teens are played by people that are in their mid-20s or about to be thirty. This is just a suggestion, but can you please make the teens on TV shows actually played by teens? And can you also make “Drama” by Raina Telgimier a teen movie? That’s all I have. Sorry for ranting."
2019-08-26 02:16:57,Shows to Pickup,5,twdgfan,False,"Hey Netflix, recently a show called deadly class got cancelled a few months back by their tv network SyFy, it definitely has a lot of potential and it could be BIG if it was advertised properly. It’s an very creative show based on a awesome comic, which I know shows with that factor become very big now. I don’t know if you’ll see this but I hope that maybe somehow you could pick it up and help them renew the show so they can get a season 2. It had 14 million viewers on globoplay for their first season, which is pretty awesome, and I know that if it becomes a Netflix original it can be even bigger. It’s a chance you should take Netflix, pick up deadly class and make it big! It could be one of your most popular shows, I know that for sure!"
2020-01-24 02:14:00,Recommended Feature,5,Weathergirlhorse,False,"Overall, Netflix is very great. It has a large selection of shows and it is easy enough to navigate. However, I would like to recommend that a bookmark-like feature is added. This feature would allow you to mark a certain spot in a program. Then, when you open Netflix next, you will have the options to go to either the bookmarked spot or go to the furthest spot. This would be useful when watching programs with others. Often times, I will be watching a tv show with my family, when I want to go to bed early. Then, later, I can’t find the exact place I had left off at and often have to guess. Bookmarks would help to keep your place so you do not miss out on any of the plot."
2019-08-03 00:53:21,New weird bug,3,Lforliz,False,"My old complaint has been resolved for awhile. The app generally seems to run well with my Google Chromecast now. 

There’s a new bug within the app in which there’s nothing for me to scroll through anymore. My home page is literally just a few shows I had started watching in the past, but nothing that I have started recently. And nothing in categories like it used to have. I can check notifications to see what was just released, but that’s the only indication I have of ANYTHING on the app, unless I specifically search for that show/movie. 

I’ve tried adding the shows I’ve been watching to “My List”, but when I actually go to my list, it’s empty. I click on the “add things to my list” button there, and it takes me back to my homepage. I go back to those shows I tried to add, and they say they’re in my list. So I’m at a loss now. Help!"
2018-12-22 06:01:27,Ridiculous Rating System,3,Not Your Average Grandma,False,"The biggest blunder the Person In Charge Of Ratings did was said ""Hey! The five star rating is so yesterday. Let's do something dumb like offer only a thumbs up or a thumbs down! Our customers will think we're awesome and brilliant if we do! They'll rate like crazy!""

Yet everyone complains that the ""thumbs"" testing isn't enough. The star rating at least allowed users to select three stars if they liked the movie and didn't have to worry about being bombarded by movies and shows in a genre they don't normally watch but wouldn't mind seeing a few options. The thumbs rating only indicates ""I REALLY LOVED THIS MOVIE!"" But the reality may be that it was only just good and the Person In Charge Of Ratings had taken the ability for a customer to let you know a movie is just so-so.

And that's why I stopped rating anything when the thumbs rating system was released!"
2018-11-23 01:14:51,I like Netflix but one main complaint,5,HILOMY,False,"I don’t have cable so its basic tv channels and Netflix for me. I love Netflix but it is so different between devices. Sometimes it takes me a while to find the shows I’m in the middle of watching and want to finish. I like to watch foreign films when I have to time to read the captions, but it would be nice to know before hand if a movie is in English or not. It shows the titles in English but when I select to watch it I find out it is in a different language so I end up having to find another one to watch depending if I have the time and mood to read captions or not. Sometimes, I watch movies and listen to them without actually watching them. Just have it as background noise when doing something else."
2018-07-21 09:11:19,Update removes practical features,1,Nb head,False,"This update made Netflix the most unusable, un-userfriendly streaming service out there. Why would you remove the fast forward ten seconds and rewind ten seconds button while simultaneously making the progress bar smaller and less responsive? Do you know how many times I tried to catch something a character said from four seconds ago and had to watch like a minute before that because I couldn’t get the progress bar closer to that sentence? I just gave up. Why the hell did you take all movie and show descriptions away so I have to individually google search each show or movie? What are you thinking? What kind of a personality-less human do you take me for that I’d watch something solely based on your vague genre tags? Please bring back descriptions. I already felt like it was hard to find something to watch, but now I’m supposed to google literally everything I come across? Please bring back all of these features. This update was so dumb."
2020-07-02 19:31:26,I really wish...,4,Yvonnevonbon,False,"That Netflix had the list viewed as movies that haven’t been watched and the movies that were already watched are in a different option screen. I usually find odd and random movies to watch but it’s annoying scrolling through a movie that looks interesting... oh wait, I already watched it 2 years ago... or I have to forward the movie a couple minutes because the first picture looks somewhat familiar and... wait, I did watch it. Agh! It’s so frustrating sometimes and I’ll spend 20-30 minutes just to find a good movie I haven’t watched but keep running into the ones I have already. Another thing is, advertising the new movies in the front home screen. I wish they would show the new releases nice and big! With some awesome trailers that will catch my attention."
2017-10-03 00:19:30,Lost its charm...,3,ziggyATL,False,"This is coming from a 13 yr old Netflix customer that was instantly sold on the idea that the original cd rentals by mail was a great idea as Netflix had a giant library of movies and tv series back then. Not to mention they shut a mega company down by the name of block buster. 

Now I feel Netflix has lost its charm. Netflix saw he future back then and succeeded. Now the future is streaming videos and have you seen the titles in their library? It is horrible and bleak, completely filled with garbage low budget titles and very few good movies. What happened to the mega library of movie titles they had and why aren’t they available to stream?

If it weren’t for their own production titles I believe Netflix would suffer the same fate as block buster. Apart from the tv shows their movie selection pretty much does not exist and this would not be worth my 10 bucks a month."

The selection of movies has improved and the Netflix originals are awesome- both movies and series. I rarely watch cable and I’m not even sure why I still pay for it. I do have a few requests though- one: please, please, please come up with a way to delete shows and movies from the “continue watching” bucket! It drives me insane that I can’t delete these, especially a series. Movies I can work around but the series- ugh! I have two I want gone; disliked them completely. Please have the option to remove from this section added. Two: please bring the star rating back. Having only the option to say yes or no doesn’t always work. I want my recommendations to be significant to what I really like. 

Keep up the awesome work!"
2019-04-28 02:42:52,Needs better options,3,Elizabethhhmar,False,"Netflix has given us all a variety of shows and movies to choose from. However, some of the shows and movies that they have on Netflix are not popular. They take out movies that SO many people love which to me is just such a huge mistake. Movies like Mean Girls, The Parent Trap, and many more movies that lots of people love, aren’t available on Netflix. I am aware that in businesses it is all about giving everyone satisfactory in their own preferences, but like I said earlier, there are shows and movies that nobody cares about that are on Netflix instead of shows and movies that are popular and are many peoples favorite movies/shows. I’m honestly starting to get bored of not having good options and if things don’t change soon, you will lose me as a customer, and many other people as a costumer because I am not paying to be unsatisfied."
2019-02-02 17:56:31,Pretty Buggy Lately,2,Macrae M,False,"Content wise, Netflix still is a five-star app in my book, but it has been extremely buggy lately. 

Almost every video I watch freezes up 30 seconds or so in. The audio continues uninterrupted, but the visual halts. I will close out of the video and try again. Same problem. I’ll close out of the app all together. Same problem. It doesn’t matter what show, it happens almost every time I watch anything. It’s tedious and frequently leads to me switching over to my computer and watching things through the desktop site instead. 

Also, there is a highly irritating quirk with completed series showing up in my ‘Continue Watching’ list even though I’ve watched all episodes. I’ll complete an entire series and then it will show up again kicking back to the first episode of the second to last season. Why? So frustrating that these few hold outs are clogging up my view."

However on November 12th it updated to the newest iOS software and I can't use it anymore, and it makes me so sad. I have an iPod 5 and it can't update past the iOS 9.0 software and this app was one of the only things I still use on it. And I can no longer do that. If there is a way that it can become available to older devices that would be wonderful, because I'm not about to go out to buy a $800 device just so I can watch movies in the car. My review of Netflix itself is 4.5 to 5 stars, but the app itself was fairly ok when I could still use it. I know I'm ranting and there is probably no way to fix this but I just wanted to put it out there that this app isn't compatible with older devices anymore. Anything below a version 6 basically. Thank you. And sorry for complaining so much."

They have movies on those that they’ve had out for years ...... Netflix force feeds and loads its categories with liberal agendas weather it’s what you like or not ! They cram liberal comedians, Muslim movies, liberal made propaganda, homosexual movies and hundreds & hundreds of Spanish speaking movies on Americans Netflix accounts who DOES NOT EVER WATCH any of that crap and even gives negative ratings on all of it ! Then they do away with star ratings after their liberal shows where getting hammered with 1 star ratings . NOW they are going to try and CRAM the worst perpetrated crime EVER against America the Anti-American , Anti-Constitution Worthless OBAMA’S down our throats !!!!!!!

Don’t get me started on when it logs you out for no reason!!! While watching wheN MY BILL IS PAID! And then it’s hard to log back in as the other problem I mention. Also fix wifi connection error message cause my WiFi is on a strong signal sis!

When i’m watching Anime i’ve come to notice Netflix only ever only has one or two seasons completely leaving out the rest of the Anime series. It’s problematic and unfair because we then wonder what’s happening next and we’re left with gran anticipation. I suggested you bring other Anime shows as well such as my hero acedamia so on so forth. Plus add the rest of the Anime series for the other animations such as attack on the titans, black butler, Haikyu. I feel like it would add more variety to the app itself and lure other people who love to watch anime as well. Not only that but you’re leaving good shows unfinished which is quit triggering. Thank you for listening please do something about this."
2018-02-10 15:09:09,Finding things,5,Ronin 626,False,I love Netflix. I’ve found a lot of shows for me & my family. Plus a lot of my favorite shows that I miss during regular airing. But as of late I’ve been finding programs & movies on my kids profile that shouldn’t be there like The Office and recently Today I found The Italian Job & in a list of programs similar to Disney programs I found Anthony Bourdain’s unknown parts on the list. Don’t get wrong I’ll keep using Netflix inappropriate programming that’s meant kids needs to stop. The programming search engine for Netflix needs to be better for mobile devices or they need to check themselves & see what about then a child’s profile account is created. I give Netflix five stars for programming entertainment but 2 stars for this glitch

But I recall the teachings and promptings of my grandparents and great grandparents. The taught me to open the door for others, pull over to help someone with a broken vehicle, help an elderly individual with their groceries or taking their yard. Now the only thing to do these days is watch vulgar, crass, lazy & self-centered individuals of all ages, sleep around, get pampered with everything they’ve never even put 2 min of effort receiving. Now the latest hit in Netflix is a few rotten teenagers getting bored killing animals, let’s go find what else we can destroy?! I should’ve stepped away from this destructive business a long time ago. They’re filling everyone’s mind that the world owes you everything and that you can do whatever you want. Well you can do whatever you want, but be aware, you don’t always get what you want when you do nothing more to receive it then by begging and crying. Goodbye Netflix, I’m done with your trash."

The fact that you made an episode about khaled aldossary without including facts is disgusting! He was a chemical engineering student and he ordered chemicals for educational purposes and the company that sells these chemicals for students filed a report against him because they felt ""suspicious"" because he is saudi/muslim even though they sell to other students. But later it was proven that the chemicals cannot be used for making weapons/ bombs of any sort but it was too late because he was already sentenced for life in prison! And for what?! For nothing?! As a company you shouldn't be biased!! I understand that Netflix is mostly run by white males but that doesn't mean that you can’t be more educated about other cultures and less racist.

Netflix has proven that it’s a racist company. I stand with khaled aldossary #JusticeForKhaled “"
2020-05-20 02:34:04,Need some improvement,5,sonic fanboy kid,False,"I loved this app but need some improvement . First, it really need to add even more cartoons because it is missing some cartoons like sonic underground, fan boy and chum chum, nick jr cartoons, paw patrol, blaze the monster machine and more . Second, Netflix should add Sonic the hedgehog movie 2020 and sonic ova movie on the kids section, and the grownups section(expect sonic ova) Ever since I was born in the 20th centery and the movie was in the 19th centery I wanna watch the movie because I miss it and sonic the hedgehog movie 2020, I finally watched the sonic movie 2020. The reason why I got that idea was a lot of people missed the movie and when they got on Netflix, there’s no sonic movie ova or 2020 sonic movie so Netflix, if you’re reading this, please put that sonic movie ova and sonic movie 2020 please."
2019-11-17 20:54:34,"Awesome, but one, tiny problem...",5,Rick_Nail,False,"Ok so, don’t get me wrong Netflix is an amazing app to watch shows, but... on some shows, you only put 2 or 1 of the seasons. :( I was watching an anime, (Haikyu!! Totally recommend) and I finished season 2 ready for season 3. Then I realized, SEASON 3 WASN’T ON THERE. I went online to see if there WAS a season 3 and there was. My heart just, shattered into a million pieces. I really like Netflix to watch anime’s because they have to English version and I like to just watch and know what the characters are saying instead of reading a watching.😅 So I would really like if you would add all of the seasons. If it’s a money problem then a totally understand but, I would like you to consider it. Thank you for you time! (Btw, I NEED SEASON 3 TO BE ON NETFLIX FOR HAIKYU!! THEY LEFT MEH ON A CLIFF HANGER >:d)"

The good movies only last for a month or two. May I consider more  horrors,Thrillers and more of that category instead of the same dusty movies since 2 years. I’m sure many people would prefer Friday and the continued series after that and so on. May I suggest my personal favorites.... Madea Movies! You have none what so ever. How can you increase your prices but give your customers a limited selection. You can do better! You only pretend to care about what your customers want but really all you care about it the money because Netflix is becoming sorry. I’m only giving it 5 stars so this review can be seen"

Now while I cab deal with it is very annoying and even worse when I go to my continue watching are and I want to EASILY see what season and episode I am on it just says “seasonNumber EpisodeNum...” and heaven forbid I click on the info button to figure it out because it says “seasonNumberEpisodeNumberWithSequence...”. Of course this is only a few of the issues and if Netflix really wants to know the rest they already would have an email so I could send screenshots and quickly describe the issue instead of killing my fingers typing a long review."

2018-07-17 01:01:03,Subtitles are a nightmare,2,VadeRevan,False,"Netflix seriously needs to improve their subtitles on the app.  As an avid anime fan, I greatly appreciate the addition of the shows that have been added in recent years.  However, watching these in the subbed versions as many in the community prefer, is near impossible with the shoddy subtitle quality.  The text often is thin, usually either white or yellow and has no background or outlining whatsoever.  This leads to confusing scenes where you have white text on a white background and it is quite literally impossible to read.  Some shows have had a black background behind the text, which is fine and allows readability, but I cannot understand why there is not a continuity in the quality of subtitles.
This is the biggest complaint I have ever had of the service, as nothing else has bothered me to the point of literally being unable to watch a show or film of interest."
2018-04-20 05:41:53,Long time happy customer...need to fix something though,5,Huffy1166,False,"I am happy with the app and Netflix. Recently I noticed an annoying issue. This is on my iPad. When I am browsing through the various collections, often well below the featured section on top, when that top featured selection timer moves it to the next feature it bounces me all the way back to the top feature again. Then I have to scroll and slide to finally find where I was and in a short time it happens again. How about that feature on top not have any effect if it is not being viewed? I am sure this is a recent bug. I watch a lot of Netflix on my iPad because I travel a lot for work. It is irritating though. Please investigate and fix.

Thanks!"
2018-02-10 01:31:23,Please read,2,LeaLhi,False,"I love Netflix, but I hate how it tells you how much of a match something is rather than the star rating. I love horror movies, so it will tell me I’m 97% match for like, every horror movie. I want to know if its a GOOD movie and how other people liked it. Not how much of a match I am to it. We are responsible enough to search for the movies we like, and we don’t need a match rating. If this gets changed, I will rate it 5 stars. 
Another thing is, sometimes when you click on your tv show that you’re watching and you’re halfway through with it, the picture will play the beginning of the show whilst the audio is from the part you left off at. It happens on both my phones. You have to always exit and then retry. 
Finally, they keep taking things off, like bobs burgers or Buffy the vampire slayer. That tore me up. And it’s rumored that new girl won’t be playing on there anymore :(
But I love the shows and such."
2019-11-06 20:17:13,Amazing! But.....audio subtitles are on by default.,4,Robert_hood,False,"I love the convenience of Netflix’s streaming service. I enjoy that it picks up right where I left off during an episode, I love that you can actually download to your phone. However, I’m not sure why the audio subtitles are always on by default. Meaning after each single episode, a voiceover will start announcing what’s on screen.
“a red N unfolds into a spectrum of colors” is literally what I loudly hear until I go in and manually switch it off. This is starting to get very annoying. I have a iphone 7plus and an Ipad Air 3rd gen. It happens on both devices. If there is a way to have the audio subtitles off by default that would be fantastic. I’ve searched the settings and I can’t find where I can have the audio subtitles off by default. Thank you."

For example today I was watching Netflix on my laptop and later that day switched to my iPad but a error message kept popping up saying I was still watching on my laptop. I when logged out of both the Netflix app on my laptop and in the browser AND turned off my laptop just to be sure but the error message kept popping up. After 30 minutes of trying to get it to work I gave up and switched to watching on my laptop just to be hounded by an error message saying I was watching on my iPad. I’m not sure why this is happing but it’s getting really annoying and is literally making it impossible to use Netflix. Please fix how you test for screen limits.

2017-12-26 19:18:54,Favorites,5,"Rover 82,84'85",False,I totally agree that maybe when removing a show Netflix could consider how the viewing numbers should be looked at. Also how do we get the line of watching could be erased or maybe we could pick which movie / TV shows we can put on hold or keep up on the line of to continue watching line.  I’m no computer expert and don’t even come close to what I can or on a computer. When I couldn’t remove it ( even after I went into each episode and fast forward to each one till end of season and still remained. I thought it was just me. Do you have any hints on how to take off.  ON THE WHOLE I LOVE NETFLIX. I can take my iPad and watch anywhere.  Thanks for the convince of everything. Even the payment and tech support are great.
2020-08-21 22:56:09,Netflix!,5,em's44,False,This is a awesome app. Use it SOOOO much. I used to watch it all day. If I had to make any suggestions I would just say can you PLEASE get some OG kids shows I noticed Jessie was gone don’t get me wrong I LOVE most of the new shows but it would be nice to have some originals. Also I love the “new arrivals” area where you can see all the new shows and movies and the ones that are coming soon! Think that is so smart and a great idea. I also love the way that you can skip the episode I’ve been on a lot of apps that I can’t skip to THE NEXT EPISODE! Which annoys me sooo much cause you either got to go back to the main page go to info the go to the next episode or watch all the credits which I do NOT WANNA DO! Congrats to the makers of this app home run for me!
2018-06-22 00:21:11,Awesome with a bit of more organization,4,Why robucks does not work,False,"Let’s get this straight, getting a bunch of television and paying little money is awesome! But Netflix definitely needs more organization it’s just a bunch of shows mushed up together put under titles that don’t make sense. The search is even a rip-off. The search only really works when something’s popular. And it definitely needs too moderate the shows more. Like it really does. Because every time I have to watch a little bit of a movie, show, etc. And check it myself. But, hey you guys managed to get all these shows and put them there without your customers having to pay a lot, so it’s a win win. Netflix is great who am I too complain, when I can catch up on My Little Pony! ( P.S Can you please try to get more seasons on My Little Pony?)"
2019-08-23 07:15:38,Who doesn’t like Netflix?,5,chesterrrrrx,False,"I’ve been using Netflix for quite some time now and I really love it. The Netflix Originals are wonderful and there’s so many kinds available to different types of people. I do hope a “Finished Watching” button was added in order to remove some titles from the “Continue Watching” section. It absolutely drives me crazy when I finished watching a movie and it’s still under “Continue Watching” burying the tv shows I’m currently watching. I also hope more animes are added. There’s already a lot of animes, but it would be better to add the following seasons, not just season 1. Lastly, I wish there were more Korean variety shows such as Running Man or Infinite Challenge. Overall, I really like Netflix."

I don’t believe this is solely a Netflix app problem, it’s probably in conjunction with Apple, since it worked almost perfectly on my Note 8. -I did need a whisper of connectivity to load the main page in order to get to the download interface, but once there I was golden- I am SO ticked about this I’m writing a review, and didn’t even scroll previous responses to see if there is already a thread, which I’m sure there is, and it’s probably as extensive as the outrage expressed on Google. I don’t have access to one star Apple, so you get the short-end Netflix app.
Edit: if you put it airplane-mode, your start-up is instantaneous. How important are those notifications? Now you must choose completely when watching downloaded content. “You said you have no connectivity right..?"
2018-12-26 04:50:15,New Format/Layout is Terrible,1,Ahubs,False,"Not sure why the layout had to be changed, but this now version out the app is absolutely TERRIBLE! On the first page there is only two sections: one to continue watching what you’ve been watching and the other is what’s trending now. Then, if you click over to more, there’s a section for my list, which would have been fine, except it shows NOTHING in it and just tells me to add movies and shows to find them easily. But I know I have a list of saved movies and shows that’s a mile long. So you basically have to search for anything you want to watch! But what if I just want to browse through the different sections that were on there before? I have to know exactly what I’m looking for to search it to even find something to watch! Someone needs to fix this app or else I may consider canceling my subscription and putting money into a streaming service that has a better functioning interface."

However, I wish there were an added feature. I occasionally get bored of movies and series’, or may try to watch it but get bored. I want to get rid of it, but I can’t. At other times, things get added in by family members, although I tell them to watch it on their profile. I simply wish there were a feature that removes what you are watching from “continue watching for...” that way If I get bored, someone adds it in, or I begin to dislike a series or movie, it can be removed from “continue watching”, instead of taking up space. It could be like what is used to delete apps off a phone, where it says cancel, or delete."

I thought of paying using iTunes, unfortunately the website doesn’t accept itunes pay. I pay almost everything using my iTunes pay but this app is the worst. Better to change the idea of the app or allow multiple payments.
Error I have faced is on the website that rejected my credit card “please check your card information” even though I have received on a notification from my bank telling that I have used my card on Netflix yet netflix doesn’t process with the card.

I really love the app!,I spend most of my time on it as an 10 y/o with nothing to do. I notice there was only kids and adult stuff, can you make It fair for the teens and add teen related shows on there. Plus somebody from tiktok had shows and movies they get to watch while others are stuck with the same shows. That’s not fair at all cause of how we get tired of all these shows and movies and she herself has Teen Titans, and other shows and movies we won’t be able to see. And can you please  bring back the movies like Coco and all other deleted movies, one time I saw it on my home page back in 2019, now it’s gone without a trace, so please bring it back, it would be an honor.

Ever imagine you watching a show that you like but puts it under a kids’ category? Yeah, that’s my problem here. I wanna say to YOU, NETFLIX, that MIRACULOUS LADYBUG IS NOT JUST A KIDS SHOW. We middle schoolers and high schoolers like it too! You think flirting is for kids huh? And crushes? And love? You expect what, like 5 year olds to already learn about love?! Yeah, it’s a superhero show but you need to know that it’s more than just a superhero show. Sure, tons of junior fans look up to Ladybug and Cat Noir but it’s more than that. It’s how love can be strong in so many ways. And I don’t think a 5 year old would understand what that means🙃
So my wish is to move the Miraculous Series from the younger kids/ toddlers (infants) to the teen group."

1. The app doesn’t keep up with Visio casting very well. When I’m watching something and I decide I need to rewind, I have to do that in the app. So I wake up my iPhone, hit the rewind, and the show ends up at pretty much the beginning. Which mean I then have to move the show navigator/slider to where I think I was watching.
AND
2. On the most recent update, (where the app put filter choices at the top for TV, Movies, and My List), removing shows from My List just doesn’t happen. I uncheck the “add to list” so that I’m left with the plus. But the show remains on My List. I tried rebooting my iPhone. The old shows were still there. I waited to see if it would correct itself. Nope. It took removing the app and re-downloading it to finally get the unchecked shows to stop appearing on My List."
2018-04-06 23:35:45,Amazing!,5,coralynrose,False,"I love Netflix. Especially the fact that I can watch almost anything. One thing is that sometimes on my shows that i need to continue watching won't show. This is only on both my iPad minis that are both updated of Software and Netflix as far as i can update them. If you are able to fix that, it is only a suggestion. I also heard (not sure if true) that Netflix will be changing their shows to only Netflix Originals. If it's true one bit, i don't like it. I am watching a lot of non-Netflix originals and I'm scared with every update that they will be gone soon. If it is true, PLEASE PLEASE PLEASEE DONT!! Overall Netflix is doing amazing! It's the only place i can watch Vampire Diaries in order over and over again. ;) thank you!"
2017-11-27 02:27:38,Good for the most part,4,LoveT4ever,False,"This app is awesome and is one of my favourite apps of all time. I’m able to watch a variety of movies and tv shows with out commercials. It’s absolutely awesome, but there is a big problem in the app and that problem is that they take certain tv shows and movies off the website. It really irritates me because I could be in the middle of a season in a show and they would just take it away. For example, Jessie was one of my favourite Disney shows. I was in the middle of a marathon and boom. They took it off the app. I was very upset and I still am very very upset. If there was one show they could bring back I would want it would be Jessie. I hope they do bring  Jessie back (please please please bring it back). This is why I give this app four stars instead of five."

I have no complaints about this! I love watching chrismas movies pls make more of them animated isn’t my favorite also I do have one ☝️ complaint that’s that if for example I start watching something like hmmm Bella and the bulldogs then I get bored of it so I stop watching but it’s still in continue watching for Alyssa can u please make a way for people to get a movie out of continue watching please! 🙏🏻 Thanks for listening bye!"
2019-02-02 17:05:57,Stop taking away gold you...,3,02018383910384892101001,False,Would give a⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ rating but the only thing I don’t like is that you get rid of shows and seasons all the time I know that this one app can’t every thing but low just because it getting old does not it’s a piece of wait got to keep this pg it’s bad and the new can’t say that crud is good also you leave seasons out to the point that we miss out on the  juiciest parts I don’t want to learn my favorite character died between season 3 and season 6 because you skipped 4 and 5 or I miss a ton of stuff in a show that likes to foreshadow stuff 4 seasons ahead of time this is how Cartoon Network messed up you know in a story driven show you can’t skip 2 seasons like I get into a really good show and you go I know we just leave you on a super juicy bit and then... that it in all there are 11 seasons but we stoped at 6 git rekt loser ha ha.
2019-01-29 07:13:37,Meh,3,Lilfeather82,False,"The newest update makes it very difficult to “scroll” quickly to find something to watch. You can only see maybe 6-8 things at a time then have to hit a “see more” button which is just simply annoying especially if you have a jumpy phone that thinks you just tapped a movie or show you did not. 
Also members shouldn’t have to wait for other random articles to come out to find out what is coming to the network or leaving. Netflix clearly has all of our emails-let us know monthly in one newsletter! 
Lastly, if we mark something we have viewed negatively, it should be removed from our viewing options. We know where to find it should we choose to watch said bad movie again! Instead it keeps popping up in every genre as if it is begging to be watched again and again! 
Ahhhhh!!"
2018-09-01 18:52:42,BRING IT BACK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,1,final boss simp,False,"Ok well first of all £}¥\!<{¥\£~!!!!!! I am so freaking mad at Netflix!! Ok so why the heck did you take off the haunting hour AND LEAVE GOOSEBUMPS!!!!!! TAKE OFF GOOSEBUMPS AND PUT THE HAUNTING HOUR BACK on WITH the 2 seasons you NEVER put on. 
    Yes. Netflix took off my most favorite show, The Haunting Hour by RL Stine. It ticked me off so bad I felt like I had to leave this review. It would’ve been different if they still played it on The Haunted Hub (Family Channel), BUT THEY DON’T I was also super ticked whenever I realized that, UH OH, there were 4 seasons but were only 2 on the one in netflix! This made me so flipping mad (I found out after Netflix deleted it) and then they DELETED it?!?! Me and my friends live in Mississippi and that is like our favorite show. We watch when we sleepover, at parties, and whenever we’re in the car. It made me look forward to Netflix everyday. AND YES it made me scared, but it also gave me memories. That show was the best. I really miss it. Me and my friends have so many memories from watching that and jumping and covering our faces.

     And then you took it off.
 Then I sent this narrowing review about how flipped I am at Netflix. THERE BETTER be a developer response or I am going to be SOOOOO FREAKING MAD. And if you do put it back (which I doubt 😡) please add the new seasons.
      I’m also sorry about sending this review. The point is just PLEASE put that show back on!
 Thank you!"
2020-07-11 08:34:07,It’s OK but...,4,reviews for apps😁😁😁,False,Netflix is an amazing app and I definitely recommend you getting it but there’s this particular show that I need five more seasons of that show is miraculous OK so here’s what should happen Kagami find somebody else that makes her even more happier and Adrian finds out and becomes extremely sad and then Marinette comes in and comforts him and then Adrian finally realizes how much he loves Marinette so they fight an extremely dangerous crime because hawk moth akoomatiezd another victim and Marinette gets hurt and her mask falls off and her secret is revealed and then Adrian finds out a.k.a. cat noir and and then Adrian kisses Marinette and then they become boyfriend and girlfriend they get married and keep fighting crime together oh and tiki and plagg become boyfriend and girlfriend to and that’s what should happen take this review to  the creator of miraculous thank you!😁😁😁
2020-04-01 21:21:03,Just a few suggestions..,4,Smod7!,False,"Alright we got to admit Netflix is pretty cool, but there is some things I want to suggest. When I want to have a little bit of a movie night most times I go to Netflix. I get on there most times to find the movie I want to watch not there. I realize Netflix is not going to have everything, but I feel like it should have the popular movies that are trending even if they are older. It makes people not have to pay for movies if they just search up the movie on Netflix, and most times it comes up cause it’s trending. Sometimes I find shows/movies that not many people really watch, so there for it’s not trending. All I’m saying is could there possibly be more trending shows that Netflix can get, so we don’t have to pay for a single movie."
2020-07-07 07:10:36,I have a question,5,jadelovespokemon,False,"So I just wanted to start off with netflix is a really great app to use to watch things and I love how there is no ads so you can watch perfectly, there is just one question I would like to ask, you people who worked at Netflix made a invader Zim movie called “Invader Zim Enter The Florpus” and I love the movie and it’s really great but a lot of people have been saying that you guys that work at Netflix will continue the show “invader Zim” so will this be true? If you cannot say if it’s official or not then that’s completely fine with me, I’m just asking because I love Invader Zim and I would be really happy if you guys working at Netflix would continue it, if not then I’m okay with that since I loved this show too much"
2020-02-21 03:48:41,Awesome a couple flaws tho,4,CamoRebel08,False,Netflix is great but why does it take so long for a season that’s out online to come out on Netflix. Also why on some shows does it say season 5 for season 3? Other than that the app is  amazing. And for my amazing miraculous lovers of you have watched all of the adrienette and lukanette ship episodes than ik this might sound weird but has anyone thought of the Ladrien ship?(Adrien and luka) ik that most of u are thinking that they aren’t gay and I understand that but the could be bi and believe it or not it’s a cute ship guys❤️ but I still think the favorite and most likely ship is luka and Marinette and kagami and Adrien but Ladrien is still a cute ship. Also for any of u who have watched the expanding universe of Ashley Garcia comment or write a review if you think stik and Ashley will be together in season 2!❤️
2018-11-04 23:53:23,Good but a few suggestions,5,Imperial Writer,False,"I really like the app and like the shows, but I have a few suggestions.

The first one is to have a 10 seconds forward button, because it is really hard to skip forward. My second suggestion is to not automatically play the movies in the featured, because it can get annoying sometimes. And lastly, I would like something for actually rating it, because I feel that all the movies either have four or five star ratings, and it’s really hard to decide when all of them have the same ratings. The user ratings let us know what other users thought and it lets us better remember how we ourselves thought the movie was. Other than that, it’s a great app. Thanks!"
2018-05-07 22:24:04,Where is max,5,🖕🏻🖕🏻money,False,"Ok so let me get this off the bat Netflix is great but this is about something different I remember a better Netflix one where you’d have your own little personal assistant named Max he would ask some different questions about the type of movie and/or Tv show plot elements you’d prefer over others and he would give you what he thinks you would like and if he didn’t get it right, it wasn’t a one time thing you could select him again and if you’d answer the question the same he would give you some different answers and sometimes the questions wouldn’t be the same as he first time 

So I just wanted to ask Will and can he ever come back please do anything to get this to Netflix"
2018-03-16 20:37:10,Suggestions,3,treeboy215,False,"I’ve read a few of the top reviews and some of them are right and some of them are kind of wrong. 

1. If you’re going to have your kids watch Netflix, change their account to the Kids mode. This mode blocks all the TV-MA/R and PG-13 shows and movies. And if you don’t want your kid watching even the PG movies and shows, you can set their accounts to little kids which blocks all but G content. I don’t know if you can change it to little kids mode on devices, but I am able to do this on my TV when setting up their account. You can also change it so only TV-MA/R content is blocked if you have an older kid. 

2. There really needs to be a better system to warn viewers when a show is going to be taken off. Maybe a notification or every 3 months they list the shows that’ll be gone and the ones that’ll be coming?

3. The My List does need to be easily organized somehow. Sometimes I want to watch a show that I’ve already seen but have to search it because it takes forever to find it. Maybe a simple filing system or even alphabetical?

4. Maybe a notification only when shows you are watching get another season? It’s sometimes annoying when I get notifications for shows I don’t even know about. That’s it."
2020-06-24 12:01:03,It's pretty great,5,fateforever545,False,"I have a large family and Netflix works out great for us being able to watch tv and two other shows at the same time since we all have wildly different likes. I like being able to go back to shows I haven't watched in a long time (and it keeps my place) and there is such a variety there is always something to watch, I wish there were some more older cartoons but the addition of Scooby doo and avatar is fantastic. I do wish there was a shuffle episodes button, kinda like the way cable does it. I love watching shows with story lines but sometimes I just want to hit random and it will play an episode so I don't have to pick. Just some food for thought!"

Now that made me mad. Also can u pls pls pls pls add the haunted house the secret of the cave on pls. I don’t care it’s not in English i just need need need to see what happens! Also you keep taking off good things! There’s only 2 of the Pokémon shows :( you take off good Disney movies and i hate it! Just pls do one thing for a sweet 10 year old girl (me and many many others) put the haunted house the secret cave on! Pls i need u to! And that’s all I need to say so pls do the one thing I ask u to do and i thank u.
Oh and ps I’ve been super sad and depressed and anxious from not being able to see it so if u put the movie on Netflix Netflix I would be super happy! Pls put it on and hope u have a great day"
2020-02-09 12:42:09,weekly episode shows not showing up as available,1,ChivaYQue,False,"2 issues.
1st: weekly episode shows are not showing up as available on the date advertised, specifically they don’t show up as available until the evening on that date (i am located in CA and my device settings are such). This started happening last week (beginning of Feb 2020). Also, dates for episodes are out of synch between Netflix device apps (see dates available for tv show Find Yourself between iPhone app and Roku tv app). Specific shows impacted so far that I watch: Find Yourself, Itaewon Class, Crash Landing on You. For example, right now it is Feb 9th, 2020 and the next episode for Crash Landing states it will be available to view on Feb 9th! They used to be available first thing at midnight, now I’ll be checking all day to no avail. Please make them available consistently at midnight or state what time they’ll be available!

2nd issue: since updating my iPhone app a few days ago, Netflix is very laggy and each time I launch the app, it takes a while to load and each time it asks to pick which user profile to load.  I’ve only used  one profile on this app, WHY does it keep asking all of a sudden? Make it stop asking when nothing has changed! It takes long to load before and after this selection screen, and the recently watched shows are off, too. 

Please fix all this!"
2019-06-28 04:35:23,KEEP SOME SHOWS PLS💖💖💖,5,LailaMEqwe123,False,"I love almost every show and movie on Netflix and I hope you guys don’t take some of them away! Like Twilight! I think bunch of people would watch it if you put it back on! I also think you should keep popular shows and movies that are pretty original... like VAMPIRE DIARIES!!! (I love vampires) All I am saying is that maybe if you got rid of some unpopular shows that are super old, you would have more space for more movies and shows that people would like to watch! Some examples of shows I think you should keep are: vampire diaries, Jane the virgin, pll, and everything similar... I hope you think about it! Also pls don’t take away vampire diaries, I’m kinda obsessed and I can’t think about getting rid of it🥺💖💖💖💖"
2019-12-20 07:21:49,Impossible to watch credits :(,4,Sexy SayDay,False,"Why is it impossible to watch the credits? I get that most people could care less but I’m a bitter ender and it drives me crazy. Once the credits begin a suggestion pops up with a watch now button and a timer. There doesn’t seem to be any way to opt out. I click on the credits, try swiping the suggestion box down and even pause the video but it still counts to zero and changes my show. There’s no “x” button and scrubbing to later in the credits doesn’t seem to work either. Please! Please! Please fix! I was already not a huge fan of movies and trailers auto playing when I’m picking something to watch (another issue with no control settings or option to opt out) but this is really quite silly! I get so mad and flustered."
2019-06-01 01:44:13,"Good Service, Bad App",1,erinj131,False,"I love the actual Netflix service; it’s a great price, & the company does great job of competing. But I literally have no clue where I’m going to be able to find my Last Watched row on the app any time I open it- and 2 minutes ago, there wasn’t one. I started watching The Society two (2!) days (48 hours!) ago, & I had no Last Watched row. Having Last Watched & My List at the top of the app on the front page so I have some clue of where the stuff *I know is on Netflix* is at on the app is not that much.
There’s also no way to browse unless Netflix has decided to list the genre. I have no idea what’s on Netflix. I understand not having a curated selection for every genre on the main page, but it’s not unreasonable to ask that we be able to look through what genres are available & be able to search by genre.
If I can’t use the app, I won’t watch Netflix. And there’s no sense in paying for something you don’t use."
2018-11-13 23:12:39,Netflix,2,cnot a good app,False,I had a question about subtitles and so I called Netflix to help me out through it and I was getting transferred to a person. I had spoken to Ben I think his name was and he had told me that LG’s  don’t support Netflix so then I had asked him to explain it to me because he said that they were there and I did t see them so that’s what I told him and then he had hung up on me. I thought that it might have been not on purpose so I called again and told him that I had spoken to him before. I told him my issues with my tv and asked if he would explain it to me again. He had then said ma’’m I have told this to you before bye and hung up the phone AGAIN! I immediately thought of how rude it was because we had a guest staying with us that doesn’t speak English and she needs the subtitles. I will be raving Netflix and joining something better. I hope veryoned reading this understands how rude it is. Thanks for you time
2018-11-04 22:34:29,It really is the best but some suggestions,5,Saryposa,False,"I wish there were more options I feel like I’m running out of stuff to watch. 

Why I think it’s the best option out there:

Price is good

Language and subtitle options are the best I’ve experience in comparison. So many languages!

I only wish there were better movie options in Spanish, more sophisticated stuff, they got the pop movies, novelas down though.

TV, tablet, phone apps all work equally well.

I like the different profiles options, especially the children’s one. (I liked it more when Netflix had Nick jr options. Then a few years ago they switched to the corporate demon-Disney instead, and not in addition to. I don’t allow my child to watch most of Disney channel, but was allowed to watch anything on Nick Jr. They actually care about your child’s development. Disney only about holding he kids attention.)

I like that I can rate tittles, I miss when I could comment....probably got out of hand though lol

I commend Netflix, they do not seem to have payed reviews like Prime does. This is a superior service but has a lesser rating than Prime, who obviously has fluffed their reviews"
2017-10-30 12:36:34,YES!,5,Bobalodjjdj,False,"Netflix is awesome! It has lots of good shows and movies for adults AND kids. Sometimes they get new movies on there super quick, but sometimes not. I also wish there would be more movies on there- more newer ones. But really Netflix deserves all 5 stars. They made it ten times better when they added the download feature, which allows you to download the show or movie to Netflix so you can watch it when you have poor or no connection without any pausing. I absolutely love it because I can watch Netflix all day long at my house with bad connection without any buffering from Netflix. A clear picture, too. I also recommend checking out Stranger Things, Atypical, and Riverdale for teens."
2019-11-05 00:44:49,Two small problems about Netflix,4,joe mummu,False,Netflix is a great app but there’s one small problem. I normally watch the Flash best show of all and I watch an episode and then the next day when I automatically play the next episode it sometimes makes me watch the last one I saw but other than that it’s great. Netflix is one of the only apps I love. It’s really cool how you can download stuff then watch on a car ride or something like that I think that’s the best part about it. It would also be cool if they got new seasons for show quicker cause they’re always a little late and more versions of the show or whatever my friends from school like Naurto and they don’t like how they can’t watch baurto or other stuff like that but other than that it’s a great app favorite one I have.
2019-08-13 00:11:08,update mirroring,4,mcollin8836,False,"please review your mirroring effect. i don’t have internet at home except through my iphone because no one offers service to our area but Hugh’s net and it’s to slow to stream(we tried), so i have a netflix account on my phone and use an HDMI cord to connect to tv. for the most part this works. a bit fuzzy but i can live with that, but for all the brand new shows like Adventures of Sabrina, or Another Life- it will not allow me to watch them until i unplug HDMI and it’ll play just fine on my phone, then i plug HDMI back in, and it won’t play. older shows and movies it all works just fine! if i was incorrectly using or not playing for the service then i’d understand but since i pay for an account then you should allow mirroring for cases like mine"
2018-02-23 04:13:29,Very minor tweaks needed,4,A man 247,False,All of my problems are with the continue watching page. Once you start a series (even just 1 episode to try it out) it stays on your continue watching page for a long long time as far as I can tell even forever. To remove it you have to go on the computer to delete it off your viewing history which is annoying (I watch on an Apple TV and an iPad idk if removing is easier on other devices) I highly highly highly suggest a “remove from continue watching” button or even the ability to do a 1 episode preview of a show before it even appears on continue watching list. Other words great app and great service although can use better shows and movies but the choices are still pretty good.
2019-07-15 21:30:05,It’s amazing! But one tiny thing...,5,Essy Q,False,"Ok, netflix is such a good app that I can use folding laundry, car ride, or for dozing to sleep. I love to find new shows but I am sad that some classics are being taken off because you can’t watch these shows anywhere else most of the time. Also the icons are great but I have an I dead for a stranger things one, a scrunchie since that was such a big thing in the time era that they were in. Also scrunxhies are getting popular now so I think it would be so so cute, and you can have this icon with a green scrunchie that max AND el wore and some pink blue purple ones too. I would LOVE to see those icons :) Metflix has saved me from ever not having anything to watch. Thank you and have a good day."
2019-04-06 17:08:51,Steady Decline In Functionality,2,Wags McDads,False,"I’ve been a subscriber for almost 8 years now, and I’m starting to get fed up. The price hikes? Sure, I understand: you’ve gotta make more money for more content. But why oh WHY would you replace the rating system with thumbs up and down? So now I only have the option of saying I either absolutely loved the movie, or I hated it. There is no in-between in a binary system. 

Second, you’ve now removed the airplay feature because of “technical limitations”? Seriously, get real. You’ve had this feature implemented for YEARS and not a problem. You’re telling me that all of my other streaming apps can cast to my TV with no “technical limitations” but Netflix just can’t seem to figure it out anymore?

I’m very, very seriously considering cancelling my Netflix subscription once I see what Apple TV+ has to offer, and I know that I’m not the only one with the same intention."
2018-08-10 15:42:56,More Episodes,3,RandomGamer4262,False,"In overall, it’s better than any other app that allows you to watch movies and series you like or would like to know more about, but there is one problem that aggravates people more than anything when dealing with this- and that is when there are two to three series and you finally get to the point where there should be more episodes cause a friend spoiled it to you or another reason why. Most people try and wait it out and end up waiting for a few months or maybe to a year to watch more, but there ain’t cause you guys are only focusing on specific series and movies while fixing bugs and glitches rather than putting more episodes that have been made for people who like don’t need to be upset. So please make an update to where there are more episodes on more series please."
2020-07-24 20:04:40,Very good but maybe to good,5,5bojorquez,False,"My brothers and me love Netflix it has so many shows and movies but sometimes my brothers are so caught up in watching them they get themselves into trouble cuz they don’t pay attention to anyone anymore if you would get rid of that Pinky Malinky show that would be great if you would get rid of Kulipari show to that would be better. But this is my opinion. I just wanna hang with my brothers more besides we can’t do much cuz of COVID-19 and I lost my best game roblox cuz they got me in trouble for trying to get them to stop watching and play roblox with me. You don’t have to do it but I would love you even more Netflix if you did thanks so much Netflix!

And what about big bang theory? i also hate how you can't download things off of wifi. My wifi is slow and i don't get access to it often and im always on my data and i have unlimited data, as does everyone else. So why can't we download stuff when we're on data but watch stuff when we're off of wifi? Also, why can we only download things twice? And why can't we download anything we want? And one more thing, if something fails to download, it should send a notification because then i have no idea that it didn't download.

2020-03-17 22:18:32,pLsSs cHanGe tHis,4,Tiffany Rosy,False,"Ok so I loooove Netflix so much. They have many originals that I enjoy. The only reason I took off one star is because of screen mirroring. I got a projector for Christmas last year and I was so exited to watch Netflix on a big screen in my room. I was so frustrated when Netflix screen mirroring didn’t work. I did my research and apparently this has happened to many others. Apparently only devices that support HDCP would work and you guys aren’t planning to change that. Through more research I figured out other companies do this with their screen mirroring, too. I do not see why you guys will not change this. If screen mirroring was on I’d be watching my shows so much more often. So just pleeeaase can you guys change this screen mirroring nonsense."
2020-07-06 15:59:59,ok people please  stop giving it bad reviews,5,the best snowman !,False,ok so a lot of people are giving it one star because it is to expensive for them or it does not have movies or shows they like or took shows off. the shows have to have a contract with netflix and it is expensive for netflix to pay especially if it is not making them money also sometimes the producer like Disney makes there own apps and wants the movies and shows to be special to there app. also the subscription costs money since they need to pay for the contracts and to keep the app running. in my personal opinion it is a awesome app and if you can afford the subscription then you should definitely get it.

Let’s say inuyasha for instance I know personally that series is completed and that It has more than two seasons .  And you guys only have those two seasons what has happened to the rest of them . I already checked if you guys were gonna update the seasons or at least a more within days but not years I mean come on if your gonna put a series at least put the whole serires in as well . Still love yah but you need to step it up tubi as more completed series than you guys come on !!!!? Please ?
2020-01-01 18:41:25,Netflix is overrated,1,emily02045783,False,Netflix used to be a great streaming video provider. It had great shows that everyone could enjoy and watch. But now it’s like it’s going downhill rapidly. My first issue is that they’ve taken well loved books and changed them drastically to meet their needs for the show. Ultimately making it trash. My second problem is that they take off a ton of their shows. Just today they took of a classic and hugely loved show called friends. And instead they’re replacing it with other stupid shows and movies. Everyone seems to know Netflix is going downhill. It’s shows are not as great and it’s movies are spinoffs and stupid. I bought Disney plus recently and it’s so so so much better than Netflix. It has great movies and shows and it doesn’t take away its old stuff. It keeps everything so that you can enjoy it and you won’t have to worry about it going away. Netflix is not worth it and I will be ending it soon.
2019-06-07 04:26:02,Netflix is amazing,5,LuckyLuckyBoi,False,"I use Netflix everyday, for the following reasons: There are so many shows to watch, and they have every genre, from horror, sci-fi, comedy, and more. My personal favorites are stranger things, and the 100. The 100 is a sci-fi show where they’re was a nuclear war and everyone has been living in space for 100 years, but they are running out of oxygen, so they send 100 prisoners back down to earth where the teens have to find out how to live on the ground, and they’re not alone. The show gets better every season, but this show is very violent. The story is very intriguing and warning, you might get addicted to watching the show to find out what happens next, and every season they’re presented with a new threat."
2019-06-02 16:05:23,Worth the Money,5,Liza!!!😂😂,False,"Netflix is the best way to watch tv in my opinion. No ads, a huge collection of amazing shows and movies, and something for everyone. 
Whether you enjoy romantic comedies, stand up, documentaries, science fiction, drama or something else there is sure to be you favorite show here. There is a huge selection of shows including The Office, Friends, Parks and Recreation, The Flash, Agents of Shield, New Girl, Stranger Things, Supergirl, One Day at a Time, Impractical Jokers, Chilling Adventures of Sabrina, Riverdale, Orange is the New Black, Queer Eye, and SO MUCH MORE!!!! I have grown to be impressed by all the Netflix originals and the selection of movies on Netflix. I am a marvel Stan and Netflix has a large selection of marvel movies and shows to choose from. I am in love with Netflix. ❤️❤️❤️❤️"
2019-06-01 23:30:51,It’s okay-,2,A honest costumer,False,"Here my problem with the app. They are replacing all of the good and fresh shows with trash shows no one is going to watch. Another turn off about the app is that I can watch all of the shows I love in another country however I can’t in my own home country. I hate that the catalog isn’t the same in all countries because is quite infuriating. A lot of the shows I live watching, Avatar:Last Airbender, Young Justice, Victorious, the fairy oddparents, Naruto & Naruto Shippuden, etc aren’t available in my country. A lot of quality comedies and movies aren’t available in my country either and when I download them (when I’m in the other country), I’m not able to watch them out of that country. I would really recommend doing something about this because even tho there are a lot of good shows on there most of it is, in my opinion and many others, unwatchable and uninteresting."
2018-08-13 07:12:38,Couple things need to be changed back,2,RA_Gal,False,"I much preferred to rate with multiple stars rather than just thumbs up thumbs down, it’s too narrow of a choice. I don’t just either like or hate a movie/show. 

The more important one is that we can only see our lists on a little line on the Apple TV, I can’t believe this hasn’t been fixed yet. I takes forever to scroll through that one line and it’s so frustrating. 

One suggestion I would really like to see is if we could separate our lists down more. So we’ve got a profile for everyone who lives here, from there it would be nice if we could put our stuff into categories, even movie/show option, or genres. Being able to search our list by genre would be nice too. We all pay for the service but other than adding new shows and movies, there doesn’t seem to be a lot of upgrades to help the customers."
2018-06-10 01:19:43,Give me more options,2,2JenZ,False,"Netflix is ok. I keep it around because of the shows that are not offered anywhere else, example: Stranger Things and Orange is the New Black. But, outside of that, it isn't up to date on the latest and greatest movies and shows. And to top it off, instead of giving me options based on what I watch regularly, it packs almost every category with international titles that I've NEVER shown interest in! When I contacted customer care about it they stated there wasn't a way to opt out of it... That you simply have to select the thumbs down rating and the app will know not to show those types of titles... Negative. After you go through and give the thumbs down to the 100 international titles the next thing you know 50 more show up in its place! It's annoying and a inconvenience to have to do that constantly. Give us the option to opt out of it Netflix!"
2018-01-15 20:03:17,Macie Williams,3,This is the best idea,False,"I love Netflix so much! I barely even watch my regular tv anymore! I do have a few suggestions/requests for the next update:
I would LOVE it if there was any way that Netflix could have the Harry Potter series, and I’m sure that lots of other people would like it too! I would also enjoy more shows available for download. There is a large variety, but I would like for all the shows to be available for download. And last but not least, I would like if there were a feature so that if you were in the middle of a movie or Tv series, and it got deleted off of Netflix in an update, it wouldn’t delete it until you were done watching it. There have been many times where I have been watching a show, updated Netflix, and then the show would just disappear and I wouldn’t get to finish it. Thanks!"
2018-12-30 20:32:15,Love it but... (also a request to bring back a show),4,xXMermaidKitXx,False,"I love the app first if all. I do want to let you know that this app is paid after the free trial so making you aware of that. The app has thousands and thousands of movies and tv shows for kids, teens, and adults! One of the downsides is that they remove many shows and movies. I find this quite dumb because there really is no reason to remove an app. Though that is a downside, I do love and recommend the app. There are still plenty of TV shows and movies for you to watch. REQUEST: Please bring back dance moms with all seasons. I love that show so so much. If you could fulfill this request it would mean the world to me. Even if you don’t get all the seasons, just bring back most of the show. OVERALL I love and enjoy the app!!"
2019-10-26 01:39:10,WHY DID YOU DO THIS TO POKÉMON XYZ ALSO MORe ANIME,5,#Alli/son,False,I love watching Pokémon but what you did is wrong I know you guy want to put new things but please bring back the old Pokémon like the season XY and XYZ and while your add I would appreciate it if you could hurry up putting more Naruto I don’t like waiting I don’t want to put pressure on you guys but I’ve been crying since you out A LOT of Pokémon I really want to see how the old Pokémon was I mean who wouldn’t I like your work but please don’t take Pokémon out add old and new ones I would also LOVE if you could get better anime like some are good but I want to MORE coolness like the season My hero Academia and more Bay burst thanks for reading and sorry for being  annoying but please do all this thing that I wrote plzzzzzzzzz
2019-08-13 03:11:45,Auto play doesn't work,2,Pizzalime,False,"I'm on an iPhone X currently running the most recent iOS update and for months now a basic feature that every other service has hasn't worked. This alone makes me contemplate whether I should even keep my subscription as it's been ignored for months. I would appreciate some feedback and assistance
Edit: on top of this the cycle to get my issue fixed through your ""support"" is pathetic, it refers me to the app off of websites only to lead you into a dead end help section that offers 3 options for each type of issue, even if those options don't relate to your issue at all. The only way to contact you is through a call and it's horribly ancient to not even have an email support system. I can call Nintendo and get support for a console older than your app faster than anyone at Netflix who's tried to ""help"" me with this"
2019-05-13 06:56:13,Please add more episodes to series,3,Neni831,False,"I like it, no bugs and tells you the tv rate so you can see if ur old enough to watch it, but it takes FOREVER for more episodes to come out. For example one of my top 4 Favorite series Supergirl has 3 seasons, right? I checked online to see when the 4th season comes out, and to my surprise there already halfway through the 5th season!!! I was so sad I wasn’t able to watch it on regular tv nor Netflix same with all my other fave 3 series, Flash, Arrow and Dc legends of tomorrow all seasons have come out yet you guys still don’t add them to Netflix!!! I really want to watch them and 1 time I waited for another season to come out of walking dead and waited for like 6 months or more for 1 season and when it did only 16 EPS WERE IN THE SEASON!!!! I was left wonderin what happens and here I am still waiting!!!!💔🥺🤬🤬"
2019-02-13 20:53:31,Love this app a lot!,4,jeffwy8,False,"I really love this application since its global release. I’ve been with it even though only a small selection was available back then and I’m still with them right now. There are a lot of improvements with the app itself but I think for offline mode, it would be best if there is a pause button on the downloads as, as at times, you have to go out without finishing the download and it would be smart if there was a pause button than to let the app try downloading the episode. Also, if you accidentally close the app from the background, and open it again, it says failed download. So I really think there should be a pause button. Lastly, more Asian dramas please! Especially Korean and Mainland Chinese! Thank you!"
2018-11-01 21:45:32,Please bring back the old shows!,3,GetTheShowsBack!,False,"I love Netflix a lot! But all my childhood shows that I use to binge watch are gone😭 I’m not using Netflix that much anymore since their arnt any shows that I used to watch and honestly my mom wants to cancel out subscription if I don’t use it anymore😂😂☠️ but anyway there are so many people, like me, who want those shows back😞✨ like “wizards of waverly place” or “Hannah Montana” or “Jessie (especially Jessie)  “Suit life on Deck” “That’s so raven” “Stuck in the middle” and do many more but anyway..... please add some of these! I love Netflix but there arnt as many things to watch and who are we even kidding? Half the things on their don’t even get watched... so why not just replace them?! I know it’s easier said then done but like at least try💕💕💕👻🤪

Hope something happens about this... Disney here we come!!!! Woahhhhhh"
2018-01-22 07:51:40,Important missing episodes,1,I will not say my name!,False,"I love Netflix. It is my go to, I watch stranger things and lots more! Then I started watching Supergirl. I am sure my fellow Netflix users understand binge watching a show! In 2 days I finished watching the first two seasons. The ending left me in tears. Of course I needed to know when the next season would come out. Then when I looked it up there were already new episodes!!!! I tried everything to get them but I just couldn’t find the episodes. Now I need those episodes. I took into consideration that the whole season hasn’t come out. Only episodes, Netflix needs to change! This is the reason for my complaint, I am not one to write reviews but no one comes between me and my shows! I think Netflix should add episodes before the whole season has come out. I know I am not the only one with this problem!!!!!!!!!!!! I hope that Netflix will take my advice. Also I am sure that this happens to other shows!!!"
2019-06-10 18:14:32,Fantastic....Although Some Better Movies Would Be Nice.,5,Music female,False,"I think Netflix would have got 4 stars before the new update just because you had to go back on the app each episode you wanted to stream on your game system or tv. But now it has the timer, I personally believe the timer is too long, 10 seconds should be the amount of time just Incase someone doesn’t want to watch the next episode. Other than that, there is the thing everyone talks about, Disney Channel Original Movies and the famous Nick movies, they were the highlight of our childhood, it would be great to be able to watch them at our leisure. I get that they can be expensive but I guarantee you will get more subscribers."

2018-01-18 08:05:15,Big fan of Netflix... the app is missing one thing,4,LieutenantDannyBoy,False,"I love Netflix. The fact that they have great content, original and from other providers is awesome! If you’re on the fence about buying a subscription, do it! From Stranger Things, Godless, Dark (once you get past the weird language dubs the show is incredible), House of Cards (Kevin Spacey is phenomenal in the show, but he’s an awful person) to content like Guardians of the Galaxy, Captain America, Batman Begins, and Shawshank Redemption. Netflix has almost anything you’d want to watch, and some things you don’t. The only thing I wish I could do through the app is set a sleep timer. I have some issues with insomnia, and tossing on a documentary like “WWII in color” always puts me in to a deep, restful sleep. With that added, I’d rate this app 5 stars."
2020-04-13 04:14:42,Riverdale Season 4,5,HiCommentsLol,False,"Don’t get me wrong I love this app, all of the series/movies are amazing, during quarantine apps such as this one come handy since you can keep binging series and /or constantly watch movies! Currently for Netflix US we don’t have a season 4 of Riverdale, what’s up with that? I’ve already seen a bunch of spoilers because basically everyone else outside of the US has, and I’ve already seen a trailer for season 5! I just want to know when people who are using Netflix in the US will be able to watch the fourth season in this incredible series, thanks!

P.S: Sometimes when a show or movie is  playing the thinking icon stays on the screen unless you refresh a couple times."
2020-03-03 23:20:59,A new show idea,5,negan6375675,False,I have  an idea Netflix I think I thought of a good show for you guys to make its called the green savior it’s about a 12 year old boy who has 4 best friends trying to survive 6th grade but they were something nobody knew about the were called the saviors gio was the green savior randy was the red and Adam was the blue savior Michael was the black and Christian was the gray savior together they had to deal with enemies along the way and they came together in the end tell me if you guys can make the show and I can play the green savior for the show just call me  and I have four friends who can play the savior together this will be a great tv show that’s PG 13 bye and think about it please and I would love the chance to do this show
2019-03-15 00:22:19,Stop spamming me please,1,elmenaito,False,"Stop sending me push notifications with recommendations. I barely have time to watch Netflix; I've probably watched less than 10 hours of content in the 2 years I've had Netflix. You guys should consider yourselves lucky I let you take my money month after month despite barely using your product... and all you guys do is spam me more. If any developer at Netflix actually bothers reading reviews, could you please add an option to turn off push notifications for recommended shows? It is mind boggling that you choose not to give users the option to pick and fine tune what they want to be notified about. Personally, the only time I want a push notification from you guys is if my credit card on file expires and you can't bill me. I would like to keep giving you my money on the odd chance I might wanna watch  Netflix sometime, but I don't need every new show shoved down my throat."
2020-06-22 23:01:25,PLEASE FIX THESE!!,4,😒😡😠😑🙄,False,"Ok so Netflix is really good or whatever, but when I go to Mexico my Netflix changes and the content in Mexico IS THE BEST. I have literally almost watched the whole movies/series that they are in the USA Netflix. So I would please ask to make something or do something so we can watch content from other countries, like maybe choose what country you want to watch the content from or just put the same content for everyone, it would make everyone HAPPY and would be the BEST!!, I really hope you can make that happen because it would make everyone happy, plus no one wants to pay $10 or more for a proxy to change your countries Netflix, I would like that you can change that but overall the app is really great just please FIX THAT!!!."
2017-10-16 20:22:24,Lately...,3,pjona,False,"I love Netflix, have been using it for years. Unfortunately, it is becoming unbearable, constantly crashing. I consistently have to restart videos, sometimes 4-5 times per show. Sooner or later, Netflix, you will lose us all to this neglect.

Update: a year later, all’s been well until your latest update. Now the app doesn’t open at all. I click on it and it crashes immediately. I rebooted phone, reinstalled the app and still it crashes. My other complaint is your useless rating system. What’s up with only giving us thumbs up or thumbs down as a choice? I’ve always depended on those ratings – it’s bad enough we don’t get to see reviews on the app. I love netflix but I’m getting so frustrated.

I see I’m not the only one this is happening to - I really hope this gets resolved!"
2019-01-06 00:24:00,Lots offerings,4,PetuniaBlue,False,"Netflix is great for one who is busy, works or is constantly interrupted while trying to view tv & movies.  They have been doing a little better offering more better quality movies with more well know actors.  For a while most Netflix movies where MA horror movies - mostly low budget movies with no ending.  At this point in time Netflix is one of the few streaming options than has more offerings (or more updated) offerings than the paid movie premium channels.  Although the paid premiums may occas. show more newer releases their prices are too high considering they have such a limited movie library rarely updated while limiting their on demand selections to the point you may find one show monthly to watch.  Netflix is more flexible."
2019-07-18 20:17:54,Awesome but 1 HUGE problem!!,3,shdnsjsi,False,"Okay, I’m not going to lie... Netflix is a great app! I love it. But in order for you guys to add new shows, you need to take some away. That makes me so mad bc your in the middle of watching something really good and then you get a notification saying that that show is being taken away in a couple weeks. PLL I am watching for the 2nd time rn but in 9 DAYS, 9 DAYS, there taking it away. Like seriously one of the top hits your taking away, can’t you leave it out for a little longer than 9 days like a month Mabey so I can finish watching it. Like I love this app but I’m ready to delete it if you keep doing this to me!!😐😭😡 Oh yeah and it can be really glitchy, and you can only be on it for a couple hours and then it say’s, “we are having trouble playing this title please try again later”, uhhhhhhh 🙄"

Continue Watching and my List are never consistently in the same place, particularly on the home page. Even day to day! Netflix appears to have the ability to alter how the home page looks in the app without updating the app itself.
Today, “Continue Watching” disappeared entirely. It’s absolutely nowhere to be found anywhere in the app. I can’t even force-touch and “continue watching.” I use that option almost every single time I use Netflix. Quit moving it around already!! I’m not going to pick something else to watch just because you try to shove your original content in my face instead of what I want. I’m going to shut the app in frustration and not watch anything."

We’ve seen it with movies like Bright, to all the boys l’ve loved before, and others. However, I truly find it odd that when a movie is introduced on their platform that promotes natural beauty of African American hair, it’s not on the main screen of the app when you first open it (even though the movie just released today) There was barely promotion on the Netflix instagram, and it wasn’t even on the what’s new or what’s trending section of the site. I Literally had to search for it. Maybe I don’t know how this is supposed to work? But overall, please try to do better with pushing content like this ! Over all, I loveeeee Netflix, I just want movies like this to be promoted better 😊"

Then half way between the old update and the new update, it crashes again. The newest update (as of October 1st, 2017) has not let me into my account at all. After updating it, it crashed right away. I turned my phone off and back on again several different times to see if it was my phone and I even took into my carrier’s store to see if something was wrong with my phone, but nothing. It’s the app. It’s always either crashing or a pop-up comes up saying there’s some sort of lost network connection, that I have tried to fix. Netflix works on my laptop and TV, even when my app says there’s a lost network connection. The only place that Netflix doesn’t work is my phone.

January rolls up and I was charged twice for the same Netflix account that I’ve been using. I canceled my Netflix account on my desktop but I haven’t had any luck on cancelling the account on my iPad. I tried logging out of it in hope that Netflix would stop charging me but I found out that I was still being charged.

You can’t even look at the credits or post credit scenes without being force fed trailer after trailer!! And every time you get on there’s a preview right there to smack you in the face before you can even process anything. Really need the option to stop the autoplaying! Also one last thing, if I was no longer watching I probably wouldn’t be on the app. So if you could stop asking me if I’m still watching, after every other episode.. that would be greeeaaaattt! Hate having to look for my remote just to press continue, I shouldn’t have to. Need an option to stop that from happening! Asap! Netflix needs more customization, more preferences, something!"
2017-11-13 00:33:21,Just some suggestions,4,TearyChunk14297,False,"I think you guys could make quite a lot of money on two three particular series if you could get the rights and make the show based on the book series, Percy Jackson is a big one and is probably one of the most popular books other than game of thrones now a days the reason the movies did so poorly is because it was so different from the book and angered fans greatly, the book I am number four would have been a lot better as a tv show, and the golden compass which did poorly based on the thought it goes against Christianity but in retrospect from just observing my fellow humans I think the populist is finally ready to be exposed to this type of story telling and if done right could be a great hit."

2018-04-13 02:07:48,Accessibility Issue,3,ninelyves22,False,"I would have given this app a 5 star rating.   As a totally blind person, I thought it was really nice that my phone would literally read to me subtitles and even spoken  materials that were clearly translated from other languages into English making it easier for me to follow certain documentaries or anything else I chose to watch on my phone.  Now though, this feature seems to be nonexistent in this latest update.   A case and point is the series Drug Lords.  When I began watching this series a few days ago,  my phone would read the English equivalent to what individuals were saying in Spanish in the background. At this point however, all I hear is Spanish with no audible English translation when certain people are speaking Spanish during the series. Please fix this issue."

They completely wiped American Dad and The Cleveland show off. And took a lot of seasons off of Family Guy. And there’s not a lot of newer TV shows on here. Other than that, I love Netflix. The quality is great and I love that you can download movies/shows. But please bring back the Family Guy seasons that was like my favorite show. And can you maybe bring back American Dad too? I know my opinion won’t matter out of the millions of people that have Netflix but I really loved those shows and would love Netflix even more if we could have those shows and seasons back and maybe a few more newer shows?"

I saw another review about this saying that u would have to look up how to delete something on your currently watching list and go through the numerous steps to getting rid of it. And that there should be an easier way to delete it. Frankly I agree with that. It’s really annoying seeing movies or shows I don’t want to watch anymore on the list. Another problem I’ve been having is, sometimes the shows people watch on one profile will somehow end up in 2 profiles currently watching list. But other then that Netflix is in my opinion one of the best streaming services. :)"
2020-02-15 15:27:54,This is a great app!,4,Earthwoorm sally,False,I love this app I really do but if I want to watch something that was popular on Netflix and now is gone I’m going to get a bit upset.I just don’t understand how something so popular can be taken off of Netflix.I wish that one day the creators of Netflix can make a website or something where you can pay or just do a trial to watch a movie or TV show that used to be on Netflix but other that I really like this app and it’s a great movie streaming platform and one last thing I would like if you would make a section for kids(face it people the kids is basically babies) a kids section for 9 year olds to 12 year olds and a teenager one and one for young adults other than that great app and keep making movies!☺️

Hey, it is okay to call me an old lady. Group everyone over 18 and still living as adults. We know how old we are, but the thought of all your categories is cute. Swearing is a more sophisticated way of saying cussing. You are growing up fast, but there MIGHT be a few things you don’t understand yet. Life can be subtle if you don’t know many of the nuances.

2018-06-01 20:37:46,NEED MORE DOWNLOADS,4,CaTa613,False,"First off I LOVE this app, it enables me to stream anything I want to. My only downside is that I hate how not everything is available for download for when you want to watch without losing data. I’m going to Washington DC for my graduation trip and it’s a 5 hour drive. My all time favorite TV show is Friends and I really wanna watch it on the coach bus but I can’t download it. There are also a bunch of other things I want to download so is it possible to make every title available for download before Tuesday? If not then can you please make at least Friends available? If not then that’s ok but my bottom line is please make Friends available for download before Tuesday if that’s possible. Thank you so much and I’m enjoying this app a ton!"
2019-05-03 11:00:07,Best App,5,Review Dur,False,"I don’t really use a lot of apps on phone but Netflix is definitely one I use. I love the variety of TV shows and movies on Netflix. It has allowed me to watch all of my favorite Marvel movies like Infinity War, Thor Ragnarock and Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 as many times as I want! In addition, every 2 years I get to watch more of my favorite show (Stranger Things). I love the Netflix originals like Trollhunters. I loved the Series of Unfortunate Events books and I was excited when they made a show out of them. It was incredibly similar to the book and they did a great job. Netflix is by far the best app on iPhone. It’s not too laggy, it’s easy to navigate, new shows come in a lot and the Netflix originals are amazing!"

2019-02-20 04:59:59,Netflix please help!!,2,kathrync2,False,I love Netflix and I used to be on a family members Account but then one day it said I had to log back into the account and I knew the Email and password it kept saying it was wrong so I thought maybe they deleted the account so I made one of my own. I made it on my phone and it’s fine to watch it on my phone but the problem is trying to sign in on any other device. Like for example i’m trying to sign-on onto my iPad and keep saying I don’t have an account with that email but I do and I also tried on a different phone various times and every time I tried to call the customer service is awful because they always say they cannot answer because of long wait times and this is been going on for like two weeks now and how long is the wait be at this point? Love Netflix but very disappointed right now:(
2018-07-26 16:25:13,Who’s got the button?,3,ScottysBestFriend,False,"The only flaw I really see with the recent updates of this app is the fact that the little button that lets you go back ten seconds is gone! That button is vital in most of my Netflix watching. Sometimes something happens and I just miss it, I didn’t read everything that it said, I didn’t hear exactly what was said, or sometimes I literally just want to see that part again. But in order to do that now I have to use the little time bar to rewind. The little time bar doesn’t go as little as ten seconds back. It goes like a minute back. Which means I have to rewatch a whole scene again simply to read the ominous text that the character just received at the end of the scene. 
Other than that I enjoy the new update. It’s pretty easy to navigate."

PLEASE HELP,2,tajthegoat,False,"So today I decided to get my own Netflix account because my friend changed her password and I didn’t want to bother her anymore. So I asked my mom to wire the money to my iTunes wallet and so she did and with doing this I took on the free trail that was offer so I didn’t have to pay her every month. So everything was going right, but I wanted to make sure this month was free because I had a problem in the pass where I couldn’t do anything because of a billing problem with my iPad. Finally I went to my iTunes wallet where I previously had 14 dollars and some change but when I went back from subscribing to the free month it turns out it wasn’t free and took 11 dollars. PLEASE HELP!!! I really don’t have the money to pay the account every month and would really appreciate the free month that I singed up for and my money back."

Because I’m personally not allowed to watch rated R movies and shows. Another thing is I LOVE Fuller House and I am soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo sad that Netflix is canceling it. I read about it so I could understand what was going on... and I still don’t quite get it. So, some of it was Aunt Becky’s fault is what it says and then another reason is views. So apparently the first and second seasons didn’t have many views. And then they started getting more views. And now it’s getting cancelled???? What!? It doesn’t make since yo me. But other than that I LOVE Netflix. And Netflix please read this and consider the teen/ tween setting, and possibly just maybe bring Fuller House back?🤞🏻"
2018-05-15 12:52:30,I love the content but hate the app update,1,Brenda_33,False,"I’ve been a fan of Netflix for years and have been able to enjoy my content on my phone easily and comfortably. However a recent update to the app makes it so that the lineup of shows that I’m watching is in a drop down menus style, this makes it so much more difficult to get to the show that I want to continue watching, also if I want to watch a specific episode of said show I have to go and actually search for the show in order to be given more information and the option of picking another episode. It’s honestly ridiculous and time consuming and just tedious. I watch Netflix to relax after having a long day and this is frankly just annoying. I would be very happy if the app is switched back to its original format. Otherwise I’m afraid this would make me cancel my subscription. Please fix this, I don’t think this is an unreasonable request."
2018-03-01 11:13:59,"Parents, do your research...",1,BuhByeNetflix!!!!,False,"I used to love Netflix so much that I would suggest it to anyone who was not already subscribed to it. Recently things have changed and Netflix has decided to add explicit adult content to their streaming service. In fact, a large portion of the new Netflix originals are explicitly sexual or gory. They also have graphic, hardcore porn mingled in with the indie flicks. The parental controls are null and void when anyone can easily switch profiles to access the main adult profile without a password (Duh?). You have no way to filter or delete the graphic content that you are subjected to viewing on your suggestions lists, it's there all the time whether you care to see it or not. Enough is enough! We were loyal Netflix viewers for so many years due to their family friendly content, well I guess that's over with, Netflix seems to be all about earning itself a sleazier nickname. I just cancelled our Netflix."

When I got home.. and took off my shoes and sat on my couch, finally I put on the tv and went to my list but I noticed it was missing so I thought this must be a mistake and searched it. It wasn’t a mistake. Then when I found out it was gone I decided to watch lost because it is afterall my favorite tv show. I didn’t realize the true meaning of the word lost until I saw too that my favorite show was also taken off Netflix and now I truely feel lost without it.

Recently there’s been people on Tiktok showing you how to get some back but if you do it that way the quality of the movies and shows are horrible and would rather have the movies and shows back.

2019-05-30 21:28:01,No yes i don’t know,3,bubblesthe hronny,False,To be fair I like Netflix but there could be something better in the future so I don’t know if it’s bad or good to watch Netflix and every show and again to be fair some of the shows like my babysitters a vampire that shouldn’t be in the kids section because I don’t want my parents yelling at me for watching a show or movie and that’s my opinion some parents let their kids watch those stuff and I can respect that but I’m just saying that in my opinion because again some kids like scary shows and I understand not to be mean and make Netflix take it off if kids like it I’m just saying it shouldn’t be in the kids section because of the monsters/vampires and I know that their just acting but it looks real to some people and some parents so I don’t want to cause any trouble.

Mean Girls is a hilarious movie people can enjoy,oops I mean it used to be, you know...BEFORE YOU TOOK IT AWAY FROM US! Mean Girls is(was)one of the top rated movies on Netflix! I am so disappointed and annoyed in Netflix. People all across the U.S deserve to have a good movie to watch after a long day at work or school! ITS NOT ONLY THE USA THAT WATCHES NETFLIX! People across the world watch that! I bet you aliens watch that, that’s just how great of a movie it is. THE MOVIE IS JUST SO “FETCH!” Goodness Netflix, I expected so much more from the “#1” entertainment application! Now I have nothing to look forward everyday! I just so frustrated with Netflix for doing this! THE PEOPLE THE PAY FOR NETFLIX EVERY SINGLE MONTH DESERVE GOOD MOVIES AND SHOWS! PEOPLE LIKE ME ARE NOT GONNA JUST STAND BY AND LET NETFLIX GET AWAY WITH SUCH A HORRENDOUS ACT!!! I WILL FIGHT AND PROTEST FOR MEAN GIRLS OF THATS WHAT IT TAKES! FOR MEAN GIRLS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! MY NAMES DESNE AND I APROVE THIS MESSAGE!"
2018-12-28 05:09:04,Continue watching,4,Skyla Matesowicz,False,Well I think that there should be a more officiant way to take movies or shows off of your continue watching list because sometimes you don’t like the show or movie and you just stop in between but you don’t want to see on your continue watching anymore so I think they should make it so you can like click on it for like two something so you can take it off of your list really easy because it bothers me that they don’t have that and it would make the app and platform way better so you don’t have to look up on line how to do it. I personally think it would be easer to use. I hope people agree. And I hope that take my feed back and it becomes a thing that you can do.
2020-08-14 03:36:25,Glitch,5,llocho,False,Ever since the latest update there has been a glitch where my screen will go black for a few seconds making me miss some of my show or movie and it is usually right when someone is going to say something important to know later in the show or movie and I also agree with firestar about needing more sections I have watched Netflix since I was like twelve now I am 17 and I want to have some actual teenage type language and some more drama and I also think you should put the marvel movies if you con on Netflix every few months and the Star Wars movies as well that would be really nice I hope you fix the glitch and consider these suggestions.

2019-06-26 15:29:30,Love Netflix!,5,Dbkilo100,False,"I was reading some of these reviews and I have to say. I have NOOO clue what you guys are talking about! Netflix is one of the best streaming apps to date. No ads, great shows, and super good at recommending shows based on what you’ve already BINGED lol. 
As for the person who said their upset you guys don’t have any Disney, Disney’s making their own streaming app! If you want Disney, download that!
Other than that, it’s a great app that I truly enjoy. I like the fact that you guys let us download shows, and the fact that you don’t have 120 seconds worth of ads every 10 minutes. So please never give us ads, I think Netflix will definitely lose a lot of people at that point."

Sometimes it’s not a huge deal, sometimes I wish it was something that I hadn’t seen, and other times, like tonight, it really bothers me. I am on my Netflix profile, where I watch chick flicks, period dramas, and The Office. The first thing I see is ‘the Chilling Adventures of Sabrina’ with devil horns and a pentagram. What the heck Netflix??? I could have gone my whole life without seeing that. SURELY, since you have access to what I am watching and use it to suggest movies, you can also use that information to tailor your ads??? Especially when on some streaming devices, the movie previews start automatically. What if my kids had been with me? I immediately deleted the app. This is just ridiculous."
2018-10-02 17:54:48,Recent update disabled my ability to watch on tv,1,NO ROBUX PLS,False,"I have the Apple lightning to HDMI adapter for connecting iPad to the tv. Netflix app has always worked perfectly with screen mirroring to the TV.
After recent update when trying to stream to he TV now only the sound of whatever show or movie you play comes out of the tv but the screen only showed black with the pause button and timer of the movie.
To be clear, the adapter is still working...it shows everything on the tv BUT the video. You can see the menu, you can see all the movies and shows available...EVERTHING until you hit play. Then the video still shows on the iPad but the is blank on the tv.
For reasons that don’t matter, this is the only way I use Netflix to watch stuff with my family and if they don’t fix it soon I’ll have to cancel since the service is no longer working. I’d really rather the fix this problem!"
2018-08-27 13:25:16,Few major problems lately.,3,TenWords45454545,False,"Generally, I like Netflix. However, I have a problem with testing to have trailers for other Netflix shows before/during watching things. I am paying for Netflix to AVOID having advertising thrown in my face constantly. I don’t need to be TOLD what to watch, do, buy, eat, etc., I can make up my mind on my own.

However, the testing of adding trailers or commercials is additionally insulting when you take out the basic synopsis for shows and movies. I like the addition of “tags”, but not at the loss of an actual description of the movie. If I don’t know enough about a show from a description, I like the OPTIONAL trailers that are provided to watch on my own time. But to get rid of descriptions and swap it for commercials and trailers that can’t be skipped is ridiculous."

That is a necessity for my Netflix watching and I think many others would agree. If I get temporarily distracted from my show and miss something important it is very difficult to go back and rewatch it. I’m very upset about this Netflix!!! I switched and started using another streaming service that allows you to rewind and remembered just how easy and carefree my life used to be...I’m just very upset Netflix please please please fix this problem. I used to love your app. Netflix used to make me so happy but now I am too frustrated to enjoy my experience the way I used to. I hope you read my review and take it to heart.

2020-07-26 00:31:42,Luv Netflix... but their are some thing that you should add,4,xxdragonlovergachaxx,False,"so I have loved Netflix ever since I was a little girl, But Netflix.... started to get boring... So when I saw a show called “The haunted house: the secret of the ghost ball” I got so excited, so I watched The Whole season and I loved it, so I was waiting for Netflix to add the next season.... but a year passed... so I thought you weren’t gonna add another season, SO I SEARCHED UP THE SEASON 2, and found out their are 4 seasons, AND MOVIES, but their in Loren so I couldn’t watch them, so then I thought.. WHY DOESN'T NETFLIX ADD THEM ALL (including the seasons, movies, and anything else from it) so yeah, Netflix creators, if your reading this, PLEASE do it, I WANT TO WATCH THEM, AND YOUR THE ONLY APP TO HAVE IT, SO PLEASE CAN YOU ADD THEM

2nd. I wish Netflix had a comment section, so if their is something you want to watch, or an issue, you can sent it to Netflix

3rd: I JUST WISH THAT YOU ADDED MORE ANIME (like the haunted house: secret of the ghost ball) and I also wish that you add stuff similar to that, for example, you already added miraculous and she-ra, so you could add more stuff like that!!!

4th: over all, netflix is an amazing app, BUT PLEASE READ THE SUGGESTIONS"

I do wish that Netflix had like surveys that you could take so that they get feedback from people on what shows, movies , or documentaries they like and dislike. I love how they add new seasons to shows quickly so you can catch up. Something that I hate is that they take off shows that I was in the middle of watching. Plus they add movies that have sequels afterwards and they don’t add the sequels. What if I wanted to watch the sequels after the movie? Overall I love Netflix and watching my favorite shows and movies just a few negatives here and there but they can be fixed."

2020-01-25 16:43:18,MY ONLY ISSUE...,4,YayeeMP,False,"Love it. 10/10. 
MY ONLY PROBLEM... is the captioning. The white text on the white/light grey text box is barely visible. Especially for people who don’t have great eyesight when it comes to lighting and stuff. I’m having such a hard time watching shows on netflix anymore because I like using captions to better understand what’s going on in the show, especially if I’m watching it in A DIFFERENT LANGUAGE. But if I can’t even read the captions then what’s the point? And if I’m can’t ever what’s going on then what’s the point of even having Netflix? 
Ya feel me? I hope I’m making sense. 
All I’m saying is white text on a *basically* white background isn’t working and who’s idea was that anyways? 
You need VISUAL CONTRAST on the captions/text box."
2020-10-17 00:10:44,Best app I have ever seen for tv productions,5,exploding gameryt,False,"I love this app because it is has a bunch of tv shows with multiple shows that you might like. Though please consider this review:

1. This app will contain many shows, yet possibly one of your shows might be removed from Netflix. Netflix, I understand you are the best place to watch tv, but some of my favorite shows have been removed. Even my childhood show got removed. Please don’t make another mistake by removing a show.

2. Ok so I have explained the TV show part, but some tv show captions have issues with the end of their captions. They will put it at the beginning of caption. Do you think you could fix this?"
2020-08-25 14:46:13,What do you think?,5,damon of paris,False,"Hello Netflix, let me start by saying you are probably the only official show streaming service that i will use because overall its perfect. I love most movies on Netflix as they are funny and interesting. 😝😂😘

Netflix i really think when you put any series or movie on Netflix I would love to watch all the seasons that is released from that series and if the series or movie is connected to a good movie or good series i would love to see them too.😔🥺😭

For instance in Netflix there is a animated haikyuu series which i love, but i would also love to see the movies of the animated haikyuu.(I’m sure the real filmed version is not that great).🙂🙃🙂

But I gotta say I love how you cross over supergirl, flash, arrow, and DC legends of tomorrow without missing any seasons, that is what i love about you, that.❤️💛💚💙

I also love how dream high and dream high 2 both series are there and it made my day.👊🏻

On that note i think avater the last airbender series with 3 season also made me happy but the movie that was released on 2010 just no. I hope you guys do a better job love you.❤️💋"
2020-02-11 02:35:30,Horrible interface,1,Phoj69,False,"My review is of the app itself and not the content since there was a new update and whoever thought this was a good should really start asking what the consumer wants.  The old interface was
Much better and easier to walk through so not sure why they felt the need to change it.  In the past you were able to move from being in a movie or tv show back home or back
To the downloads main screen but now you actually have to back out of what you are in before you can move.  It really is a waste of time I keep clicking on the home button and if I am in something it does not move so frustrating not everything needs to be updated every week like Facebook.  Getting
To the point were there is nothing new coming in and watched everything already a million times and Netflix or the network won’t let you download again"
2019-08-08 15:47:48,Hard to read info,4,Fed up facebooker,False,"I love Netflix but all the info is so small on my iPhone I have to use the magnifying glass. That’s so frustrating. Would love to be able to zoom in on titles and info. I cast to my tv and have had no problems. Love the Netflix original series and there is a pretty good selection of shows and movies but would really love some older shows and movies. Also, I’ve noticed that when looking through the main screen at titles you only show so many. Not all the movies and shows you actually have under each category. Example, under horror you will not see Hell Raiser but you can find it under search. Overall great app, just can’t see the titles and info. Really need to add a zoom feature."
2019-04-23 15:55:59,Constructive criticism,4,nick0157,False,Something I think you guys should change is when you’re continuing to shows you started watching there is the continue watching section of all the shows that you started watching and sometimes you don’t like the shows and you just want to take them off of the list to like to be more organized and do more stuff make more room for the other shows but you can’t take them out of the continuation section so maybe you guys good fix that and there’s also a Watch again section and maybe you’re not proud of some of the things you watch or maybe just don’t want nobody else to see it and it would be good if there was a button to take it off that list.
2018-04-27 23:55:57,I hope Netflix reads this,4,Jayline87,False,"Obviously the Netflix apps functions nicely. Movies and Shows are organized in a clear, easy to understand way. I really like the movie photo size. Its perfect enough so I can see the image but not too small where the screen is too cluttered and distracting.
What I really wish what that there was a better way to organize My List. There are countless very specific categories of lists or lists of related shows, but I wish My List could be organized into similar categories. It would be like if they had Pinterest-like “boards” and I could save my ‘drama tv shows’ or ‘documentaries’ so that I don’t have to scroll through the entire list of shows I’ve saved trying to find something."
2018-11-24 18:10:42,Great but Glitching,5,Midnight-Storm,False,"Hey developers, I don’t know if you’ll see this but this has been really frustrating for about two months now if not longer. I love Netflix and I’ve used it for a long time now, but when I use the app on my iPad it seems to cause my iPad to glitch out and randomly restart itself and I’ve spoken with apple support to make sure it wasn’t the iPad itself and they ran diagnostics and my iPad itself is fine and this only happens when I’m watching Netflix, and it’s very frustrating to be in the middle of a show for my iPad to glitch out and restart itself so if you could please figure out the issue and fix it I would sincerely appreciate it."
2020-04-08 14:17:40,"Good, but could be better?",4,MS5372445,False,"I’m updating my review since Netflix fixed a lot of the glitches I noticed previously- it’s been working pretty well and I’m pleased. BUT, you know what would be great? A watch together option! There are third party options that do this but why not have the option right in the app? Both/all the watchers have to log in, then they can watch together! Also I’d hate to get this feature and then have part of the movie covered by a person’s face, so if the movie could take up the largest part of the screen and just have a narrow part on the side or the top where the video chat feeds go, with maybe the extra space below/next to those going to text chat, that would be best."
2017-11-20 05:15:00,App Conflicts,2,Halfrek,False,"I set up my account in my web browser with my credit card because I didn’t want to link to iTunes. When I downloaded the app to my iPad to watch shows and logged in, it didn’t recognize my login (and YES my browser login works). I deleted the app, reinstalled, tried a little problem solving, internet hunting for similar problems...eventually, I just tried to resign up  with my same info on the App. However, it ONLY gives you the option for iTunes. Why doesn’t it recognize my account on the app? Why are there no solutions for this in the question box? And why does the mobile App for iPad only give you one option: iTunes. Also, why when I delete the app to do a reset so it just keeps all the same info: even though i had not finished signup on the app and would just like to log in normally ?"
2020-08-28 22:18:26,Good app but..,3,heck hamlin,False,"Before I download a app, I look at the critical section of reviews, and I saw a lot of hate because of some girl who was “Kissing” maybe more then that, if you know what I mean, and she was eleven they were saying, and that really caught my attention, because the rest were trolls. And maybe if your gonna do a sorta Kid kiss Grownup thing, you should at least put in Anime or something cartoon, because no one on earth wants to see a child kissing a fully grown woman, I mean that’s just disgusting to be straight up honest. Please animate the part or make the entire show anime, because it’s just disgusting, you can get sued, and also it’s wrong. And the kid might not even know what’s going on! Please fix and also people were saying add Coriline back, which I don’t really want, cause that move gave me nightmares and my sister teases me about it, and also can you not maybe have a waiting thing for a movie, because people will sorta, how do I explain this, uh just like find it on a different app and then you get less popular. Please read this and don’t skip it please. This needs to be addressed. Thank you,

Sincerely,

Hazel

(And people with the Kid kiss Grown up, thing u called them “Cuties”.)"
2019-01-03 06:30:23,Little fixes,4,Jean160724,False,"I love the app but there are a few things the company should consider changing.
1. Auto play option: my auto play does not work even though it is on. It works on some shows but other I have to manually push “play next episode.” I like to watch Netflix as I fall asleep and hate drifting to sleep just to have to wake up to go to the next episode.
2. New episodes: you guys are putting out so many shows that you just stop putting out new episodes for tons of shows. Some of my favorite shows just get forgotten and never updated! *cough cough* bring back the OA, hurry up with Diablero, frontier, the last kingdom, glitch...
3. Short seasons: cut the crap 6 episodes per season is trash lol
4. More movies: self explode"
2018-07-03 07:12:58,Good but has an annoyance,4,Mr.Wheelzies,False,"The app does 99% of the stuff it claims to do. I can watch movies and shows wherever and whenever. It’s casting that is the problem. It’ll connect to my tv with no problem but as soon as I leave the app and come back, the in-app controls become useless. It shows that they’re working in the app but it doesn’t change anything on the tv. The only way I’ve found to fix it is by disconnecting from the TV, quitting the app, reopening it then reconnecting. That fixes it until you leave the app and have to do that all over again. I understand that this isn’t a HUGE problem but it’s big enough to annoy me quite a bit. If that was fixed this app would be near perfect in my opinion."
2018-10-25 08:07:32,What happened to you?,2,AntiSarah,False,"You have failed me, Netflix. You used to be fantastic. Now I can hardly find anything worth watching. Your selections are far from interesting now. Trying to find a specific genre of movie is getting more and more difficult. When there are items in the My List that are expiring or have expired, you don’t send a warning. Also, why can’t I search according to type of program. For example, if I want to find every program with sharks I should be able to just put sharks. Every shark bad movie, documentary, or tv show with the main them is Sharks should pop up. The same with “Ghost”, “Vampires”, etc? One more thing, for now, can you please hire a few work-from-home employees to write or edit movies for trailers or descriptions? Those percent matches mean absolutely nothing. At least bring back the 5-Star system."
2018-03-25 20:05:24,"New movies are great, old movies are MISSING!!",4,Sbercede,False,"So I've been with Netflix for a couple of years now, and I haven't regretted spending the money for it.... BUT.... I would really appreciate it if maybe we could bring back some of the old shows and movies. 

I grew up watching a LOT of the old Justice League shows and Batman stuff, and it'd be nice if my siblings could do the same as well. The only problem, is there's literally nothing cartoonish concerning Batman and Justice League and all that good stuff on Netflix. 

So please, bring that back, the Justice League shows and Batman cartoon movies. That would definitely make me give you a five star rating. Nonetheless, the system is great, and I recommend it to anyone reading this!! Thank you very much, and God bless!"
2020-06-22 11:00:08,Why are all of the good anime not available,4,Queenofcuties,False,"So I like anime like naruto and I watched it on my profile on kids and finished it and years later I realized naruto wasn’t on kids anymore and I realized that not just naruto was not on kids but NARUTO SHIPPUDEN and I always wanted to watch it after I finished naruto and it made me mad. I get that naruto and naruto shippuden has killing and violence so it makes sense that it is no longer on kids but I am a older kid so it is stuff that I watch but I CANT WATCH IT ON KIDS and so it would be better if you made different kids so you can make little kids,kids,and OLDER KIDS like me and a age group for the different groups of kids and when you edit your profile you can change your group of kids thank you!"
2018-03-08 05:48:42,Still frustrating to use,2,TheSilentTypo,False,This app plays videos fine but it feels bare bones and lacking in useful features. I don’t understand why Netflix makes you leave their website/app to watch trailers for their own content. Why isn’t My List always at the top? I don’t trust their algorithms and don’t care for the randomness of categories I’m presented when I open the app. Just make My List persistent at the top or give us the option to in settings. I feel like they fiddle with things in the background so much that they aren’t paying attention to the friction they’re creating for their customers while navigating the app. I love much of their original content and can’t understand why they haven’t dialed in the app interface yet. It’s been so long I feel like they just don’t care and are content to just have it be mediocre.
2020-09-13 16:38:37,Frustrating,3,robili27,False,Netflix is awesome but I personally found a show that I really enjoy and it only came out with one season and the next season doesn’t come out till October 2021 so Netflix if you actually read these if you are going to post or put out a show do it with lol the seasons. The only reason why I went to ratings is because I don’t know how to contact you but this makes me very mad. So for future reference don’t post a show if your not going post all seasons and at least put about her season of Julie and the phantoms because I have watched the first season and only season 5 times. And if you are going to post the seasons separately then do it closer together don’t wait more then a year to post the other season. So take my advice and post the seasons together. 😡😡😡
2020-07-16 09:28:54,It’s all good except this😓,5,Eve_💔,False,"Uhm this is probably stupid to say, but Netflix is a great app trust me BUT as some may know Netflix no longer has Rebelde in the USA and I’m kinda upset even though I’ve watched the show more than 2 times but I was just in the middle of watching when suddenly it stopped and that’s when I saw it was because it was no longer available :/. I’ve been looking somewhere else I can watch it but I can’t find anything. It would mean so much Netflix if you could bring rebelde back- I’m aware that Netflix took it down in december so it’s very dumb of me saying this till now.. But that is all I had to say once again sorry for this dumb thing 😅"
2019-07-19 09:42:35,A few suggestions to make the app better,4,Kinerd1909,False,"A) an option to delete things from the “continue watching” section. Multiple times, I’ve started watching something, hated it, stop watching, but it takes FOR-EV-ERR to go away from “continue watching.”

B) a warning/heads up on selections when they’re going to go away permanently. For example: “hey! This title will be permanently leaving Netflix in _ days! Watch it while you still can!” I know that this info can be found online, usually. But who has time to go and check? There was a show that I was watching that disappeared halfway through the series. Had I known it was leaving, I would’ve prioritized watching that over things that are still available."
2019-06-20 05:59:00,Needs more genres,3,Nina/thieschafer,False,"So, I am a huge fan of netflix. (I’m actually watching it right now haha.) But the lack of anime on there really bites! I for one LOVE binge watching anime. Such as FairyTail, Black Butler, Naruto. The problem is. All 3 are missing movies/episodes! Fairytail has 9 seasons but I only see one! Leaving me having to find all the other seasons... We pay for the episodes yet half of them aren’t even there. And you take off all the movies that I loved! Such as White chicks, mean girls, Titanic?! I’m sure many others find a problem with this too. It’s so annoying when I think I’m completely done with a series than I turn around and someone is telling me about how they finished a 3rd or 4th season that I never knew existed! If you decide to add new animes with many seasons and movies please add them all!"
2018-12-10 19:18:10,3 Issues,3,.Some.one.,False,"Great app. Good price. Easy to use and the download for offline is a great feature to have even if its not for every show or movie. App works well except for three issues. 

#1 is that the Continue Watching category doesn’t always show up even if i close the app multiple times. So i have to search the movie or show i was watching to track it down which is really annoying. 

#2 is that the ratings have gone from a 5-star system to a thumbs up or down system. A minor issue but i find it much better to be able to rate something on a scale of 1-5 instead of 1-2. 

#3 is that there used to be an alert when selecting a show or movie that said it would soon be taken off of Netflix. Another somewhat minor issue but really great to have. I haven’t seen one in months and when a show or movie gets taken off while im halfway in or so it can be really disappointing. Maybe add a category of shows that will soon be taken off so we can enjoy them before they silently take off. Another great addition would be to also add a list of shows coming soon to Netflix so that we know if something shows up that will really interest us."
2018-05-25 17:04:05,Bottom of the screen,3,Unfairaf,False,"Why have my current stream AND the other stuff that I need to resume at the bottom of the screen. If I try to click on my stream to pause or whatever, I keep hitting the resumed shows. THIS IS ANNOYING. You can have the resuming shows listed just how you have our regular list or the search.

Other than that, you guys need to work on your background refresh time. I mostly watch through google chromecast. I can start a show, watch maybe two episodes while my phone screen is off or just having the app run in the background and it doesn’t sync up correctly when I open the window that I never closed. To get it back to where it actually is, I have to close out the app and relaunch it so it’ll sync up with the chromecast."
2020-09-13 01:19:36,The movie cuties.,1,Captain stubie,False,"The movie cuties is a Netflix original movie that overly sexualizes 11 year old kids. The movie shoes naked images of one of the 11 year olds, yes I said 11 along with crotch shots. Netflix even said themselves and issued a “trigger warning” about sex and nudity of the 11 year olds. This movie is so wrong in so many ways and promotes child pornography. Reading the description of this movie and seeing part of the trailer is in so many ways wrong and disturbing. This movie needs to be removed right away from Netflix and nothing ever like it should be produced. I am extremely disappointed in Netflix because they not only one support child pornography, but they also do not see how this is wrong. This is supposed to be an app safe for children to use, this movie shows the opposite. The girls in this movie are only kids so they do not understand how this is wrong. This movie makes me sick."
2020-03-20 00:09:25,I don’t want to watch kid stuff,4,Italiano playz,False,"Look, everyone says this. Teens need there own section. The adult shows are inappropriate and the kid shows are just boring. Like I’m too old to learn that friendship and teamwork are always good. Also, I started a show and have watched it 15 times because there is no new season!!! And this show is good too. I also hate how you change the picture, when I see it I think, “oh, they changed the picture, they now have a new season.” But of course, no shows, is it just me, or does Netflix forget the unimportant shows that I like and add new seasons to the “popular” shows? I have resorted to watching ‘Haunted House’ but I can probably say all the lyrics to all of the episodes. I love the show!!!!"
2020-05-23 04:25:28,BLASPHEMY,1,😁/😡,False,"This movie that you’re realizing with Paris Jackson as Jesus is not okay. Why do you guys at Netflix headquarters feel the need to mock Christians continuously? Horrible app for this. That movie deserves to be canceled. That’s mocking my  religion Jesus is SON of GOD not daughter. In Matthew 14:33 after Jesus walks on water, the disciples tell Jesus: ""You really are the Son of God!"" In response to the question by Jesus, ""But who do you say that I am?"", Peter replied: ""You are Christ, the Son of the living God"". And Jesus answered him, ""Blessed are you, Simon Bar-Jonah!..” so obviously Jesus is a MAN. This disrespect Christianity in every way, and since you don’t seem to care about Christians it disrespects Muslims also. Jesus is they’re prophet and he is obviously a man. I can’t believe Netflix has come to this. Without this I would give the app 5 stars but the creators of the movies that include blasphemy are completely delusional, and should not be allowed to be producers of any sort. Horrible production."
2018-12-08 02:13:47,Love the app but...,4,BubbleGum Tootie,False,"I’ve been using Netflix since this summer and it’s been great so far. However, I updated it recently and this evening I decided to watch a movie. Turns out that I couldn’t continue to watch my movie because “too many people were on my account” and it said I could either upgrade the plan or turn off someone else’s show/movie. Obviously I wasn’t gonna turn off somebody’s show and I most definitely wasn’t gonna upgrade the plan since I’m only 12. Please change this because people like to watch movies anytime they want and you are depriving them from that privilege because you wanna charge people to watch their movie while others are watching their own. Thank you❤️"
2019-02-11 00:55:24,Removing shows without any warning and too expensive!!,4,Manda777714,False,I hate that fact that Netflix removes shows and movies without telling people first because they remove a lot of good movies and shows and people go to search it up and is not there. Another thing is how expensive it is I want to watch Netflix for the shows but for the amount of money it is a month I would save so much if I just bough the movie or tv season on another steaming app/website. I understand that Netflix is just trying to make money but they should really consider taking the price down instead of up every year or just keep the price at a reasonable price range instead of 16 dollars a month of 2 screens.
2018-10-24 00:47:53,Want a Feature — Otherwise Works Great,5,Gooblatz,False,"First: Runs smooth, the Netflix library is pretty good and their streaming infrastructure seems top-notch.

I love the downloads for traveling.

It’s that last point where I had a suggestion: Add a feature to support Google Cardboard and such VR headsets for phones. I’m not talking about new VR shows; I’m just talking about putting the existing content on a big virtual screen in front of me. A little bigger than I can see all at once without moving my head. And that’s it. Maybe let me use a capacitive button to do stuff. Maybe not. The headset costs like $10, and imagine what that would do for your relaxation on a six-hour flight."
2018-07-19 17:00:18,Could be better,3,dhhfdjrku,False,The updates seem to be making things worse. There is no longer a description of shows or movies just a few keywords that don't form a sentence. The previews are great except if there is a preview there are no related movies or shows which is a huge bummer. It would be nice to be able to remove items from your continue watching list even if you don't finish them sometimes you start a movie or show and don't like it. It would be nice if you had a recently watched list. It would also be nice to get more things added with notifications. I get maybe one a month and by the time I get it I've usually already watched it. Also it would be nice to have this other than what Netflix created in those notifications
2020-07-27 21:29:39,Best app in the world but...,5,bubahlahlu,False,Ok I love Netflix but I gave it a 4 stare because they keeping removing shows and that’s why Netflix in 2018 lost a lot of people ok Netflix it would be better if u don’t move shows and it will be even more better if u have marvel disney Nickelodeon and more trust me if u add the stuff that I told u u will always be the best app and some people will come back and u will make more money and that’s not it I can give u more tips ok I will so it will be cool if a Area where u type in a show and then if a lot of people type in the same show u can add it and u can know what really people like u can bring it and yeah bye I hope u read this comment love u Netflix

2018-04-04 23:40:01,Amazing!,4,Iffy👍👌😐,False,"Netflix is amazing, great graphics and shows. Me and my family use Netflix almost every day, my siblings find it very entertaining. Netflix is great for sitting down and spending time with family, or just having some you time. There are many great shows and movies organized in categories, which makes Netflix even better. Although, I have a suggestion... I think Netflix should make a update where you can read or listen, to books or just make a new website perhaps called ‘Netflix Reading’ or something like that. Instead of buying every book, they should make people pay just like normal Netflix. Overall, I love Netflix and it’s definitely a everyday or week thing for me."

2020-09-09 20:40:41,May be a problem,4,gsggshhhd,False,"As I’ve noticed me and many other kids in my state like to watch anime, but we all have the kids section because of our parents, And there a limited good anime’s we can watch there, so we have to sneak into our parents account and watch anime. To solve this problem We would really like it and when I mean we I mean, all 445 girls in our school that watch anime, so we would like it if you could add more anime’s like romance or comedy or like fear and other things to the kids section, and this is a very good app but still we really do not want to sneak into our parent’s account, thanks for reading this, again very good app I would recommend to everyone!!!!! Lots of support, that one anime girl🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩"
2020-06-03 23:53:52,Deleted shows and movies,4,gohsthunter3748,False,"I absolutely love Netflix, it has many shows for both kids and adults. It is low price and they add new shows/ movies every once and a while. There is only one thing I dislike..... when Netflix deletes a show or movie that you like. For example, not too long ago when I was going to watch one of my favorite shows, Heartland, the next day, it had disappeared. I had checked through my list(I added it) and through search, but couldn’t find it, which made me disappointed. But I get it, you have to make room for other things that people like to watch, this is just something that I’m not really fond of, yet this app is amazing other than that. :)"

2018-07-22 15:17:48,I love Netflix,4,sandycandygrl,False,"I have used Netflix for a few years now. I love it. I got to catch up on Supernatural. The app was so good until... 

Please stop auto playing the trailer when you first log into the Netflix app. It’s very frustrating. At least make a way to stop playing it. I have to hit mute every time I pause or put the app in the background. Otherwise this is a good app. I understand you are advertising for a new show. But this is a good way to lose viewers. Also I don’t like how the app shuts down after you finish an episode while you are multitasking on the iPad. If you fix these problems this would be a great app. I’m sure I’m not the only one who doesn’t like the auto play when you first log into Netflix."
2019-05-04 23:38:23,Netflix,5,lorivega13,False,"So, Netflix is a great app for kids all ages. My favorite shows are glitter force doki doki and all hail king Julian.I just wanted you to make it to where we could write reviews on the shows. 

This is one of my favorite apps,except for animal jam, and peeps that are reading this,you should download animal jam to if you haven’t.   

I like that I can pick from multiple choices of movies/shows and not have to worry about paying. If you parents want to sit with you’re children wile they are using this app,then go ahead! But,you don’t need to because this is a highly recommended safe app for you’re children. So is animal jam. If you’re reading this,then download it!!!"
2019-04-04 07:17:54,Poor playback experience damages the Netflix name,1,3yo-baby,False,"The app places the rewind, play/pause, and fast-forward controls in the middle of the screen, blocking the video, despite all the empty space above and below the video due to letterboxing.  Not only that, it has to dim the video while showing the controls, further blocking the video. 

I found that double-tapping on the left or right side of the screen triggers the rewind or fast-forward action, corresponding to the placement of the rewind and fast-forward controls.  That’s nice, but guess what happens if you double-tap near the middle of the screen, where the play/pause control is?  Not play/pause, because that would make too much sense.  No, it rewinds or fast-forwards, depending on precisely which half of the screen the double-tap lands.

If I pause in the middle of a video and switch to another app, when I come back, instead of returning to the video I was watching, I get kicked out to the main screen.  I guess Netflix wants to promote whatever they promote on the main screen more than they want me to watch the show I’m watching.

All in all, annoyances all around, and they add up to such a poor experience that I’m not going to continue my subscription when my free trial expires.  Netflix had a strong brand, what a disappointment!"
2018-11-15 00:27:58,"App Stinks, Customer Service even worse!",1,noshortcutscook,False,"I’m on iPad Pro and can see “My List” in one profile but not the other. When I contacted Netflix, which I had to do on the phone, customer service was useless and rude. When I asked questions about why I had this problem and how to fix it she said there were just glitches sometimes. As I asked another question she said she had no control over what Netflix did. I then asked if she want Netflix? Who did I just call? Yes, this was Netflix the company but she had no control. I asked if she couldn’t submit feedback and she said all calls were recorded. Oh, and best of all when I asked about fixing my problem she said she could CANCEL MY ACCOUNT! Clearly they are making too much money and DON’T CARE ABOUT THE CUSTOMERS! They should just put up a recording that says our customers service reps are just here to collect a paycheck, not to help you!"
2020-05-11 23:18:25,Netflix is great,5,elaine/lainey,False,I love Netflix it is a great concept. I enjoy all the recommended shows and if you busy watching something else’s atm you can add something to you list to watch is later. Secessions/issue is that on a MacBook you can download any shows or movies because it’s not an app for MacBooks it’s just a website. Also the list that I mentioned earlier only is one list. The app should allow for more that one list like a list for “waiting for the next season to drop” and another spear list for “new to watch” or “watch on be beach vacation with family” it would just help organize everything in everyone’s personal list(s).
2018-05-14 12:46:50,It’s an okay way to spend some time as a family,2,Alexis7865,False,I honestly believe that Netflix should add some of there older shows back on like family guy something for adults no just movies I understand that they are raising the price and I honestly don’t believe it’s fair because all there adding is movies and Noh that many good shows my nieces like to watch Rick&Morty and I tell them that Netflix doesn’t have it  and I understand how when they come over that’s all they watch and they should add more adult shows like American dad and stuff I mean don’t just raise the price and take shows off and I have 2 accounts I mean if this doesn’t get any better I’m deleting my accounts and there gonna lose like around 26 dollars and I know that’s not a lot but if allot of people delete there accounts it’s gonna add up and there will be changes
2020-04-16 21:00:11,What I think For Trolls the beat Goes on,5,dawn fawn calf math rat,False,I know this is just a review But I really want to have the people that made trolls the beat goes on give poppy the hair tie that she has in her hair half of the first movie and like the whole thing from the second movie. And it bothers me that poppy and branch act like they are just friends when they are way more than friends. Maybe have them have a bit love towards each other but them not just friends. But it’s ok if the person that made it isn’t able to read this and if someone from the makers of any of this can tell the people that made the series to i don’t know maybe to read this 🥺🥺🥺 😋😋😋
2020-04-04 17:27:16,Stop cancelling shows w/o us knowing,4,becky1225,False,Honestly this app is great. It’s 100% my go-to but it gets annoying when you find a good show to watch and are left with a crazy cliffhanger ending just to find out the show got cancelled before the next season. I get it it’s something you have to do but a heads up to some viewers at the very least or let us be a part of that decision. Just because you didn’t get enough views when something comes out doesn’t mean people won’t watch it. I don’t watch shows as soon as they come out and I’m sure plenty of other people wait also. If we had some say in what goes out and what stays then it might be easier on some viewers who get hooked on good shows.
2019-06-26 17:51:04,Options,4,FavFave,False,"Netflix is a really good show. But what is bugging me off is the fact that there are some of my favorite movies that I was getting ready to download before my vacation and I saw that they weren’t there. So I’m asking and begging Netflix to bring back all three high school musicals cuz that would mean the world to me. And also, catch up on the seasons on different series like riverdale season 3 came out a while ago. Plus put the actual date when another season is coming out like don’t just put season two is coming out in 2019. But overall I really do enjoy Netflix. Just work on those things and bring my my favorite movies and I will enjoy the app even more on all of my devices and TVs"
2020-09-06 18:36:58,screenshot feature,4,Shhhweaishi,False,"let me start off by saying that this is an amazing app. Especially for times like these during quarantine. But there should be a screenshot feature! whenever there's a funny scene or a character makes a funny face in a show or a movie and i want to screenshot it, the screenshot turns out black (same goes for screen recording). i say there should be a button right next to the tv button that shows a camera icon, when you click on the camera icon it takes a screenshot of the screen as if it was a normal screenshot. of course this would be a little of an inconvenience for apple users as if they want to crop the screenshot they would have to leave the app."
2019-06-21 04:12:41,Netflix..........,2,The_Electric_J,False,"Netflix used to be my main source of tv even though I had cable. Then I went on one day and one of my favorite shows “How I Met Your Mother” was being taken off even though at the time it was only 3 years after cancellation. then they took “Family guy” off even though the show is still running. Don’t even get me started on how they on many occasions have put out a few seasons of a show then canceled it. They cancel shows that are doing good like “Santa Clarita Diet.” That show even ended on a cliffhanger so it just doesn’t make sense. Also why does it take so long for a new season of a show to come on to Netflix? Like if season 1 and 2 are on Netflix, 3 doesn’t come on until 4 is already out on cable or wherever. I love Netflix and I still watch it but some of these issues need to be fixed."
2018-11-04 01:52:35,Play back and navigation feature sock,2,808loops,False,"The most annoying feature of Netflix is The auto play feature. When you open Netflix features, trailers are the last show you watch automatically start playing. This is annoying as it is difficult to navigate with this playing in the background. This is also difficult for those visually impaired users that use audio navigation accommodations. Also, Netflix choose to change the orientation of topics. Wanted to scroll to your saved movies or last watched movies or TV shows it’s difficult as it is constantly changing. These are needless and conveniences that hurti users experience within Netflix. I feel I am forced to needlessly scrolled through Netflix originals just to find my content I saved. Hopefully Netflix will make changes soon."
2018-05-31 00:03:23,You need to fix this!,2,Basically Basic Colby,False,"Okay Netflix, look. I love your service! I don’t know what I would do without it. The only thing is, after you recent update I haven’t been able to sign into Netflix on my IPhone 7. The app was working perfectly fine before update 10.9.0 but now I can not even log in! Explain that to me! And, on multiple devices, I checked to see if the login was the same and is was. I just can’t log back in on my iPhone! I did end up having to reset the app to try to log in because it wouldn’t even load. After it would not let me sign in, because “my login information was incorrect,” I deleted the app and reinstalled it. But to my surprise, it did the same thing! Please, Netflix I need you to fix this! This is the first actual issue I’ve ever had with your app. Don’t let me down now!"
2018-01-11 02:19:50,🙄,3,This not such a great app,False,"Don’t get me wrong I love, and when I say love I mean LOVEEEEEEEE Netflix☺️. But the problem is they either remove the good things or they won’t put anything good on, like I’m a 2000’s baby and I’m still in love with stuff from Disney Channel or Cartoon Network and I’m just sad because I would love for Netflix to upload some of those old shows and movies, and it doesn’t HAVE to be from Disney but you could also ask people what they would love to be on here and put it. But this is my opinion and I feel like sometimes Netflix just doesn’t want to work like I click on a movie and it’s just practically telling me I can’t watch it?! Like 😱😒.  As I said don’t get me wrong it’s still a good app I love it but I’m just saying you should add more good movies and shows people like to watch🤷🏽‍♀️."
2020-07-16 04:59:13,We need a section that includes tv-14,4,Awesome Girl 10000,False,I love this app and it has lots of good t.v. shows. But it is missing one thing... a young adult section!!! Teenagers that have helicopter parents don’t let them have the adults version because they are afraid they might watch something that they didn’t want them to watch. It is totally understandable but Netflix needs to have a setting that they can choose for the profile what ratings they are allowed to have. For example for a preteens profile they can put t.v. 14 and below and only ratings for movies and t.v. shows that fit the description are on the profile. This is very important and needs to be added!!! Netflix would be so much better with this update.
2019-10-13 02:54:39,Just a heads up,4,tiggermuster,False,"Hey Netflix I love this app, but you know when shows are ending and the part where it waits for about 15 seconds is when it shows a picture of what show is trending and the show you’re watching’s picture, one of the shows is haunted and the picture for it is a little creepy, and I know that those pictures change all of the time, but maybe you could put a picture of a show they may be interested in watching, so if you’re watching an NBC show, you could show the picture of another NBC show they may be interested in. Again I love this app but this is a complaint that is important to me, maybe in the next update you could do this, no rush."
2019-01-05 23:21:41,Please answer me as soon as possible,4,PLEASE READ AND ANSWER!,False,"Dear Netflix,
            I was wondering if you could PLEASE add this kids movie called “Lemonade Mouth” it is my favorite movie and I have been looking everywhere to watch My fave movie because I haven’t seen it in a long time but I could not find it anywhere then I thought of Netflix but you guys don’t have it either can you please add it though Me and my sisters love it!If you consider it or tell me if you can’t or can please answer me as soon as possible and if you do I will give you 5 stars instead of 4 but it’s ok if you can’t please have the developer help me and answer my question,again it’s ok if you can’t I will still like this app!-One of your lovely customers"
2019-06-17 21:01:51,Buggy Downloads,3,ladedadido,False,"Usually this app works okay, but recently I’ve noticed a lot of issues with downloads. I download a lot of stuff so that in case my WiFi isn’t great or something it won’t buffer. Often when I go into the app I see shows I previously deleted and sometimes it even has the icon on the tab button showing that something is downloading, but nothing is. It’s not that big of a deal just buggy.

Update:
Downloads have greatly improved, but recently went into my phone storage and saw that Netflix was taking up a good chunk. When I went to check why since I only had a few downloads at the moment, I saw that over half of the shows in the downloads list were shows I had already deleted from the app."
2018-07-22 21:56:11,Still waiting for the profile lock feature 🙃,4,netflixlover....,False,"I love Netflix, only issue I find is you can’t lock a profile to a device. Ex: Kids can easily switch between accounts to view non appropriate content. Yes, you can set up a password but it is a little annoying when you have to enter that password every single time. An other example: when having multi profile and someone is on the wrong profile and your watching the same title but you’re at a different part/episode it is just inconvenient. I know that’s a user issue but again it would be convenient to be able to lock a profile to a device. Movies anywhere has it and I love that feature!!"
2020-08-07 19:36:32,Great but...,4,cookieyay13,False,So I use Netflix time to time but I hate when they take out some movie or tv show that use to watch because sometime I want to see it but I can’t find it then I find out that they took it out which is very annoying because it really good movie or tv show and they just take it out so I really hope that u put some of them back and I wish their was some movie and show in Netflix like ninjago and their this show I like it call winx club I really like it but why do you only have season 7 and not 1 to 7 it make more sense if you put 1 to 7 instead of making it have only season 7 it really annoying how you did that. Beside that I think Netflix is pretty great :)
2018-01-28 14:25:55,"Dear Netflix,",2,Arlene Davidson,False,"I adore Netflix and always have. But, today, or overnight, or even yesterday—I’m unsure of the date—they made an update that excludes the skip intro option for shows with theme titles and took away the layout when your watching on a phone which is basically most convenient with a ten second skip ahead and ten second rewind option with pause it the middle. They returned to the old form which is completely incomprehensible, being that I am unsure why a brand would regress. Bring back the layout I describe for watching on phones back immediately if you want people to continue with this streaming service. Discontinue making unnecessary  updates and try to broaden movie selection. Quit fidgeting and find actual practical ideas, work on your—sometimes vapid—movie selection."
2017-11-27 02:21:28,PLEASE CONSIDER I love Netflix,5,Just Another PotterHead,False,Over all I LIVE FOR NETFLIX but.... I think this idea I have CAN BE BRILLIANT so I’m not really ever acted for anything well I trick my friend and it’s always been my dream to act but it would be cool if on your phone theirs a free sign in for acting additions so you chose A role you’d like to play and read off the lines and record your self auditioning for the role and upload it. The. If you get the role Netflix contacts you because you sign up and then bam! Role. It make it easy for kids/teens/adults to come out of their shell! Please please please consider this I personally love all the shows (stranger things!!!!) and a lot of kids/ preteens could have future in acting!!!
2017-10-07 14:17:54,Y’all need to do better!,1,Kcalikcali,False,If I am finished watching some it should not be in my “continue watching list” or start all the ways from the first episode like I never watched it. I should be able to take some off of my “continue watching list.” It only does this on the phone and you guys need to take that into consideration especially if you going up on prices. I need to get my moneys worth. & I should have to pay 7.99 for movie like training day. That makes no sense why would I pay for movies you all had on here for free. And you guys need to put the shows that you asked(tweeted) that you all should put in Netflix . Also you guys need not to put a second part of a movie if you’re going to delete or not have the first part of the movie. Example don’t put Brother Bear 2 if you deleted the first one. That makes no sense at all. Like I said do better.

2019-07-31 02:37:41,Love Netflix....but this one little thing,5,aaralynwill06,False,"I love the movie “The Strangers” (2008) and I have the app on my phone and in my Roku TV and when I go to the movie on my Roku tv it says that it’s available on Netflix but when click on that, it goes to some other movie that has a similar title “Strangers” that is unrelated to the film. But more importantly, on my phone it’s not on there at all. And I know the first problem is more on the tv but I would like you to put that movie on Netflix and not have it linked to some other movie that really doesn’t have anything to do with the REAL movie. Anyway I’m not mad or anything just a suggestion 👍🏾 😊😊 thank you!"
2018-10-04 20:20:20,Love it!,5,Branndonn_21,False,"Netflix is an app where you can see some tv shows or movies that you haven’t seen in a while. They also have many shows where Netflix it self had made some amazing shows and movies. However, in the anime part of Netflix there are some shows that I would love to see more seasons of. Like, My hero Academia, fairytale, sword art online, bleach, blue exorcist, etc... these anime’s have more seasons and I would love to see more of the seasons on Netflix very soon

And preferably in English ❤️❤️

Also I would love to see more of Rick and morty, family guy, dragon ball, South Park courage the cowardly dog, well pretty much all 90’s cartoons from Cartoon Network, Nickelodeon, and Disney 😁"
2018-10-28 00:39:05,Disappointment in what Netflix now has to offer.,1,Scotty Borden,False,"In the past Netflix always had a good selection of movies to choose from. I don’t have internet at home so I down load and play the movies at home with my girl friend for a relaxing and enjoyable evenings. Not so any more. Lately I have down loaded serval movies just to find out they were ALL in a foreign language. The title I read was in English leading me to believe the movie is in English. Now I have to play the movie to see what language it’s in which has become a nuisance for me. Some of the movies take several minutes before the dialogue Start. I’m now finding more and more movies are in a foreign language.
   I’m not the only one with this complaint. My mom, brother, sister and friends all have the same complaint. The fix is easy.
Can’t the personal people at Netflix’s better organize the foreign dialogue from English .

2018-05-16 12:07:47,"Great, but take a look at my suggestions.",4,IX VI,False,"1- Add more tv shows and movies

2- notify the customer IF the tv show/movie is going to be taken off the application.

3- if you want to take off a tv show/movie at least look at the ratings because some people might’ve actually liked it.

4- Add reviews where people can explain what they liked and what they disliked instead of a thumbs up or thumbs down.

5- add trailers to every tv show/movie.

6- add RELEVANT tv shows/movies

7- add more subtitles, not everyone in the world is perfect in english.

8- there are some tv shows that are not updated with new seasons, example: jane the virgin is one of my favorite tv shows and season 4 is not in the app, pretty little liars, teen wolf, the vampire diaries, the walking dead, but you still want to update other tv shows, like stranger things and thirteen reasons why. IT MAKES ME FEEL LIKE YOU ONLY WANT TO ADD SPECIFIC SEASONS FOR SPECIFIC TV SHOWS.

9- I love the app, but some GOOD updates would be pleasurable.

10- that’s all I have to say, I love netflix, there are just disagreements to everything I guess.

11- also, add recent movies and tv shows."

2018-07-12 08:34:16,Offline has some bugs,3,Ch🍌,False,"I use the “download offline” feature a lot and I’ve noticed that sometimes it will just delete the shows/movies I have downloaded WITHOUT a warning. 
I know that if you don’t start a show/movie within a certain amount of time it will let you know that the content will be deleted. That, however, isn’t the case. No warning was given at all and since you can only download a show/movie a few times a year it gets frustrating. I end up downloading a show 2 times because the content was deleted without a warning and when it’s deleted the second time I can’t watch the show offline until the year time limit is up. 
An overall great app but if this could be fixed it’d really help"
2018-07-06 21:04:45,Very upset with you right now you should know that,1,insertion carpet,False,"The reason I’m upset with you is because you never posted season two of free rein yet, I was expecting it to already be posted, why would you do this, I’m just very surprised, not in a good way, you better post this before five or I’m going to be so upset I will not delete this app but I will not use it, you should know that people who love free Rein are also probably very upset with you, this has to be put on Netflix soon, if you could hear my voice you would here how upset I am, this needs to be posted today, it says, season two coming July 6, it’s July 6,, But is season to here? No, it is not, thank you very much for not posting it, I am not happy with you at the moment, this needs to be put on Netflix, or I will write another one being a little more strict, I know this is long, but I’m so upset right now, I can’t help it"
2018-05-27 16:34:41,App is basically broken,1,njhchung,False,"Whenever I open the app, it always freezes on the loading screen. I once left the app open just to see how long it would take. Ten minutes later and still loading. Doesn't matter how often I delete then download again or refresh the app. Same, persistent problem.

Another problem. How many times do I have to press play for the video to actually play? If I’m lucky, at a minimum five times. I thought it was the headphones so I took those out. The problem persists. Thought it was bad connection. Nope. Tried LTE, WiFi in three different places on different occasions, even a friend’s data hotspot. Problem still persists. 

The app’s gone down south lately. I’ve tried updating and uninstalling/reinstalling. I still have the same problems. Instead of trying to make the app flashy, can you make it so that it’s, oh I don’t know, USABLE???"
2018-05-05 23:04:29,Really? Maybe add?,4,AlexMMV,False,"Why do you guys delete 
shows? I'm so sick of it, first it was Kicken' It, then Boys Over Flowers, now PLAYFUL KISS. I was in the middle of watching all of those, then you just go and delete them? The heck, other than deleting shows, the quality of Netflix is pretty good. If you keep deleting shows, then I'll just not pay anymore, or use it. Losing clients=Less money. :) Edit: Is it possible to request shows to be added on? If so, I would recommend Naruto Shippuden, in general Naruto is popular on Netflix. I'm sure other people would enjoy watching the rest of Naruto, yes they are many other apps to watch on, but we already paid for this. Maybe you could add Naruto Shippuden? Just a small suggestion!"
2018-05-16 02:54:29,Only on one screen,1,Glizam,False,Recently I have been having issues with only being able to watch on one screen me and my son will try to watch two different shows on two different devices and they pop up with “ screen limit” I don’t think that this should even be an issue bc if you can have multiple people and screens with the app then they should all be able to watch how ever many shows with out being told that there are to many screens on the app. There fore I don’t recommend if you have kids and want them to watch but you as well or how ever it my plan out for you. It is not a good app for multiple viewers on different devices this should be fixed and I think that they need to fix it bc I won’t be watching Netflix for a while and neither will my son. We will find a different app to watch tv on or movies bc it isn’t working out.
2020-08-23 05:32:50,STOP TAKING OFF SHOWS,4,Pway 4,False,"Netflix is a great app overall but they need to stop taking off genuine good and funny shows/movies just so they can make room for teen romance movies. Don’t get me wrong I’ve loved some of the teen romance movies like to all the boys, the kissing booth and stuff like that. But it’s really disappointing when I go back and see that shows/movies like just go with it, daddy day care, and old ish movies like that are gone! Just because it’s low rated doesn’t mean we should take it off. And the other rumor about Netflix taking the office off! That to me is ridiculous. 
I just think they should open there mind up to other things other than teen romance stuff and have more of a variety!
thanks!"

The last show we watched was Avatar the Last Airbender, and Netflix just recently added that to there selection. However I tried to search the show up on this app and the first thing that pops up is The Dragon Prince, which is totally not what I’m looking for. Netflix please fix this bug.

2020-02-14 14:00:05,Better parental controls,4,LeeGeeeeeee,False,"I like the app just fine.  What I don’t like are the parental controls. It seems rather flippant of Netflix to say creating a child’s profile and then letting the parents make sure they use the right one is any kind of effective control.  Parents can not and should not have to watch over their kids shoulder to make sure they are using the correct profile.  Come on NETFLIX, get a grip and let us put pins on profiles.  The other option you suggest, putting a pin on maturity level across all profiles is needlessly cumbersome and inconvenient.  For as much as you charge for you decreasing level of offerings I don’t know why this should be a problem for you."
2020-03-13 04:02:23,Movie/ TV Show Generator,5,AllyOTomato,False,"I remember years ago, when Netflix had this like “quiz” you’d take and it’d pop out a movie or tv show you might like to watch. I was way younger and I saw my family doing it and having a blast with it . I’d really like that feature to come back because there’s so many underrated tv shows and movies out there , especially coming out on netflix, that nobody has found yet . And for people like me , we just don’t know what to watch . We need a good series with lots of episodes and seasons, movies we‘ll want to rewatch with friends . Movies like After and tv shows like I Am Not Okay With This, these are goldennn."
2019-03-28 14:03:04,"Good movie selection, except for one thing....",4,slkriderchick,False,"Netflix is great for viewing anywhere with any device especially when you’re on the go. Being able to rewatch my favorites is awesome, but annoyed by one thing: If you’re going to offer to view part 2 or 3 of a movie saga, why can’t I see part 1 again? It just irks me that I can’t see the previous installment. Some movies only have 1 other part to it. Why can’t I see it again while the newest episode is out too? For the most part, I’ve been happy with my subscription for the last week, but because of this one annoying thing, not entirely sure I want to keep it long term once my shows are over for the season"
2019-06-21 19:48:00,Good app but not as good as other countries,5,Liiil12346,False,"Netflix is probably the best video website/app in the world but the problem is that some countries like UAE have a very limited selection in comparison with the other countries. In one country they will have all seasons and in the one I’m living at we have to wait a year for the next season!
Seriously you should reconsider unifying the distribution.
Also can we have the option to remove a movie/show we were watching from the “continue watching” section because sometimes we dont want to continue watching it stop and we don’t want it popping out whenever we open the app."
2019-05-08 01:32:37,Love the app!,5,lovely___reviews,False,"My family has had Netflix for a really long time and the content is actually pretty great, especially the Netflix originals like “On my block” I have watched it at least 3 times since it came on. Definitely my favorite app and amazing concept and customer services. Netflix is the best app in the App Store but sometimes it does annoy me that the original iconic shows are gone now. I also heard that “the office” was being taken off, and that is my favorite show, That would be disappointing. They are also apparently canceling “switched at birth” really soon. 

On a side note: are they making another season of On My Block?"
2018-08-27 04:22:46,Suggestion,4,nicknamesarealotofpressureidk,False,"I love and appreciate Netflix a lot, but the past few months my auto play has stopped working. I finally got curious and started looking for a resolution, it’s because I’m not connected to wifi. That doesn’t even make sense to me. I don’t have wifi at my house because I live in the middle of nowhere so the prices are obnoxious, but I have cell service and unlimited data so it’s not that bad. BUT i love auto play. Like it’s the most annoying thing when you’re having trouble falling asleep and you’re finally starting to, but then you have to turn around and look at the bright screen just to press play for the next episode. Anyway, first world problems am I right?"
2018-08-03 04:01:50,Love the app...however...,4,lovettapps,False,"I’ve always loved the app. However it seems like ever since the recent update every time I open up the app the trailer plays for Father of the Year. It’s pretty annoying & this only started since the last update. I always have to mute it until I start playing a program or movie. Not really sure if this is just happening with this particular movie or if it’s going to happen in the future with other movies or TV series. Really rather not see any trailers immediately playing unless I actually want to see the trailer.
I really hope that this can become a quick fix on the next update for the app! Then I will certainly change this to five stars!"
2018-05-02 20:26:25,Good over all,4,a spice user,False,I do really like Netflix! But on thing I’m not a huge fan of is that you need WiFi. YES I know that you technically can watch it with out but it never works for me I will download it and then try to watch it in the car or something but it’s not there or it just straight up won’t download. Another thing is I wish is said when another season of a show is going to come out. It says on some shows previews but one of my favorite shows just came out with a second season and I had no idea it was. I like knowing so I have something to look forward to. One of my favorite shows alexia and Katie does not say when it is going to come out with another season or if it even does!
2018-02-15 01:54:23,"Great service, lousy rating system",4,Viking63,False,"Everyone knows that Netflix has a great selection, and the service is stellar. 

The problem comes with the app development team, and their change to the rating system. 

A thumbs up, thumbs down system is the most moronic and worthless system ever. Yet the rocket scientists who develop the app decided they were geniuses for implementing the least innovative, most ineffective way to measure a person’s opinion of movie selections. 

Without the ability to grade a movie on a scale, when you are looking at previously viewed movies, a thumbs up doesn’t tell you whether you loved it, or simply didn’t hate it. 

Which also means, their suggestions for you are worthless. As they have no way of gauging your level of interest in a particular type of movie, they only know you hated it or didn’t. 

Maybe that was their intent behind this Luddite move. This way, they don’t have to actually work at determining what movies to suggest, and can simply offer the ones that are most profitable for them to have you watch. 

Aside from that, yeah it’s great."
2019-09-18 10:44:22,Netflix Review,4,justlistenE,False,"My entire family has Netflix. Whenever we do a movie night that’s where we look, but recently Netflix has been taking off all the good stuff off (they are taking off the office and friends, which are two of the most popular tv shows at my age) and putting on absolute Netflix original crap. I mean some of them are good but some of them are absolutely terrible. I wish that Disney wasn’t being so greedy for more attention and money and that they would put back on some of their stuff. I know this review sounds like I’m trashing it altogether but there are some things netflix needs to tweak for example how you can’t
take a show off your watch later."
2018-01-25 15:39:54,Why?!,1,iveth96,False,"I live in Mexico and I went to visit some relatives in USA. We decided to watch a movie on Netflix and tell me, why the selection of movies they had were more interesting than what I get in Mexico? I don’t know how that should make me feel because lately there hasn’t been any interesting movies at Netflix and I been waiting for almost 2 years for netflix to air the 8th season of TVD but I thought maybe I had to wait a little longer but when I was with my relatives they had the season 8 and some other movies I been wanting to watch. The movies that I have on Netflix when I’m hometown really are wack and bizarre.
Another reason why I rate one star will be because we can’t rate movies anymore or watch how many stars a movie has. That was a really helpful feature but now with the percent and the thumbs up and down makes me want to not have Netflix anymore."
2019-12-27 20:27:48,disrespectful,1,verycool11,False,"Let me tell you something this is just cruel and horrible... you trying to make fun of my religion (Christianity) by making my savior gay. This is so disrespectful. We put money into to this app and you are gonna lose so many subscriptions by doing this... you decide to only try to make fun of biblical story and twist them up into satan‘s words... smh.... the Bible states a man and man/woman and woman shouldn’t love each other in that way. GUESS WHAT NETFLIX TAKE A REALITY CHECK, a woman and woman/ man and man can not have babies. This is horrible that kids and babies have to look at this junk... I do not believe in the stuff LGBTQ+ do a but I do like them but not believe in the stuff they do. I never saw you guys make fun of other religions and I hope never will, and please don’t make fun of Christianity. Anti christ will not win this war and we will fight for what is right and my god is the only god. And he is not dead."
2019-12-27 17:02:07,DO TAKE DOWN FRIENDS OR THE OFFICE,3,ALC2433,False,I don’t agree with you taking down friends and the office it seems as if you guys are always taking on the shows that have the most views why not instead of taking down the shows that have the most you take down the ones that have the least views. I also know that thousands of other people do you not agree with you taking down the favorite shows.  Everybody loves Netflix because you get to pick when you wanna watch the show/episode and when you want to watch it and there are no commercials that's a few reason why everybody loves Netflix but if you just take down the favorite shows you're going to lose thousands of people more people than you lost whenever Disney+ came out
2018-07-25 06:14:31,Change?,4,WuZzUp123,False,"Can you change something because I realize you only have a “go back” button but don’t have a “go forward” button and it’s hard to get to the next scene in the movie or show so I was think when we double tap the right side of the screen we can go forward into the movie/show and when we double tap the left side we would go back into the movie/show and I had a update on the app and it had that and how it had the “next episode” button I don’t think you should change it fully but if you can probably add a go forward and back button and also a “next episode” button, it will make watch shows and movies easier."
2019-08-04 11:27:12,Issue with streaming recently,2,Khmailloux,False,"I love using nextflix. I have it on my iPad and use an hdmi cable to hook it up to a television monitor. Lately the picture quality isn’t the best and I am having issues with streaming things. When I press play the show starts and very soon after it will freeze but the sound continues and occasionally I receive a message to try again later. Sometimes the screen goes black and the sound continues. Also some titles play with low picture quality and within the first five minutes it freezes and I have an error message. Specifically one episode of a show will not play. No matter what device I try on. Something was fixed with this about two updates ago I think, and then it started again. 
Please save me from a Netflix-less existence."
2019-07-08 03:43:14,It’s great but could be better!,4,DoughnutLuver_55,False,"Personally, I think Netflix is great! I love the TV shows and movies that are on it, but I feel like it has very limited options on some things. It is also taken off some movies that I really love to watch and I really don’t want to buy them somewhere else. I would love it if they kept it movies on because some people still might wanna watch them. The variety is great and it has many TV shows and movies. I love Stranger Things and To All The Boys I've Loved Before, but there are things I would really like to have on there. Example, Sailor Moon. A great show. (In my opinion...)  But it also has movies I would like to stay on their, such as the Spy Kids series.

~Jessica 😊"
2018-03-20 14:31:39,Content Turn-over,1,The Bamajr,False,"I’m so sick of Netflix getting rid of titles my family, specifically my kids, watch. At first glance it would appear they have a lot to watch (they do), but almost as soon as you find a TV show you like, Netflix gets rid of it. Lab Rats? Gone! Mighty Med? Gone! Veggie Tales? Gone! Many, many more titles; gone! I know some people would say this is not a review of the app and more an opinion about their service. I say they are two of the same. I’ve been a Netflix customer for a long time. Longer than I can remember. However, I’m not going to download 2, 3, 4 or more apps, more subscribe to (pay for) 2, 3, 4 or more services. The Netflix app is limited by their own P&P. They continue to remove titles and they don’t offer live tv. For these reasons, I suggest you are better off with one of their competitors and is they reason that I’m likely to cancel my account."
2020-08-05 11:07:45,Honestly great,5,L3hhggfggh,False,This app and service definitely gets 5 stars for its selection of movies and tv shows really my only complaint is that it seems the service isn’t able to get the green light so to speak for various things like the live action transformers movies that won’t really affect my review but I would like to see those movies and maybe some more new tv shows or movies if it’s possible to get a license for them in the US (where I’m watching I guess using a VPN would help but I’m already paying for the service why pay for a VPN just to watch a movie) but no matter what I’ll keep using this amazing service
2018-09-04 23:10:50,Why did you do this?,4,🐈Kitty🐱girl🐈,False,"Ok. I personally LOVE Netflix. It is such a great app and I could watch things that I like, like My Little Pony- oh... wait, NVM, you DELETED MOST OF THE SEASONS!!!!!!!!!! So, I guess I loveD Netflix. MLP was the only show I loved on there, I mean I had others, but My Little Pony is my jam! Ok, you probably get a lot of reviews saying bring stuff back, but I have reason. I have been watching MLP since my mom showed me it when I was 5 yrs old. IM ALMOST 11, and and still love it. Could you please at least bring season 8? The newest series? I can’t watch it on TV, and the only other way I can watch it is to pay $30.
Anyways, I love Netflix and will NEVER delete the app, but don’t delete shows people love. I feel heartbroken.
Thanks!"
2019-05-30 13:59:14,Stay out of politics!!!,1,MikeMead_64,False,"I use Netflix daily but that will quickly change if they continue to be political. The consequences of leaving Georgia over A TREMENDOUS BILL TO SAVE THE LIVES OF MILLIONS OF ABORTED BABIES will far outweigh the consequences of listening and following the snowflake army. This service doesn’t have the platform to decide what they believe is right or wrong and much less express that as a warranted opinion to the public. You provide streaming services to customers behind closed doors. So shut the hell up with your opinion on legal matters and stop dividing this country more than what it already is. If you left Georgia quietly and without a public outing, that’s fine, but don’t start making threats as if us Georgians will take your threats seriously. hahahaha i laugh at the ignorance of this pathetic company and i hope this starts a tough and grueling downhill battle with the inevitable demise of Netflix."
2018-07-17 04:12:16,I like it don’t love it,4,AvaD566,False,"I was finishing up Season 2 of Scream The TV Series and was left with a huge cliffhanger. So, I went and looked up when the 3rd Season would be out and apparently it already was. Knowing it wasn’t on Netflix I looked up when it would come out. Scrolling through lots of websites reading that it was already on Netflix. I was kinda confused so Netflix plssssssss fix this because I want there to be a come back from Season 2. Anyway I think it’s great for binging and just when you are with friends or really bored. There are so many great shows including Stranger Things which is a Netflix original. I would love to see many more shows including more Netflix originals!!! 🤩🤩🤩"
2020-01-21 04:29:36,Getting lazy,4,saviorGLADIATOR,False,"Let me start off by saying I love Netflix but, every time I see a new cartoon,anime, or show come out it is always 10 to 12 episodes and sometimes the show is good and I Benge watch it but, it takes like not even a whole day to finish and it gets boring. so maybe you should make a show have people or fans review it make like maybe 24 episodes or 2 seasons then put it on your website then bingo! Everyone enjoys you guys even more and even if it takes a little more time you guys do have stranger things but, Rome wasn’t built in a day you need patience I feel like you guys are just trying to keep shooting the originals at us that are good but not finished."
2018-05-23 03:10:02,Movie and Tv show selection,3,Store-bought Lee,False,I love how you have a wide selection of tv shows & movies but every genre is limited there is not a lot of romance or romance comedy the one romance movie that fought my eye the most was “The Kissing booth” nothing else other than that also you need more binge worry shows to make you stop what your doing just to finish up 5 mins of a tv show even if they are Netflix originals more of those wouldn’t hurt either and the shows you do have on right now are a tad bit out dated you go on all different types of social media and you see pages that are just for new shows and movies coming out that look so interesting and I go and search them on Netflix and not one thing pops up or nothing related to it either
2018-02-28 14:56:45,awsome,5,"B""rad"" the hustler",False,Anyone that bashes this app completly is an uneducated idiot. Well not so much uneducated but lacking in the common since dept. The biggest problem these people have is that all the shows are not family friendly.............well duh. People watch a wide range of stuff and you see a tv-ma rating then dont put it on for your kids to watch. See common since tells you that there is a rating system for a reason. Search yur common since before your negative post only because you look like an idot to people that think. I do have one negative and thats the selection could be better and only a little bit better.
2020-05-14 22:06:27,Outer Banks,5,€£¥*,False,"My favorite Netflix series before Outer Banks came on ,was Frankie and Grace. Sorry to hear you’re canceling it. I could watch it forever ....maybe one of the TV stations will pick it up.     I watched the first two episodes of Outer Banks on different nights. WOW & OMG.... I watched the third episode and I couldn’t stop. I was on the edge of my seat and when it was all over my heart was pounding. I wish a TV station would pick it up so we could watch it once a week .   Once  it’s on Netflix everybody binge watches and then it’s over till the next year..... Too Long to wait!!! Thanks for picking it up. Hope you don’t let it go... oh by the way I live in OBX 😎"
2019-10-29 15:57:36,love netflix!!,4,softball094627,False,"hey netflix!! i really love netflix and i watch it a lot and i remember a few years ago when i was in 5th grade you had shows like Jessie, Kickin It, Lab Rats, Good Luck Charlie, shows like that. The good Disney chanel shows and i truly miss it so much. i don’t understand why they aren’t on there anymore when i know so many people would Love them on there again. i haven’t been watching it too much lately because i feel like there isn’t anything to watch besides stranger things which i’ve seen a million times over and over. it is a great show but i truly miss my childhood shows. i don’t know if you could take that into consideration but i’d appreciate a response. love nextlix!!"
2019-06-19 03:06:24,"Exceptional, yet a bit questionable.",4,bella.gutz,False,"The demographic in which shows I am recommended is a bit weird. Although I fully speak English, as I am not multilingual (but kudos to those who are), I keep getting targeted for foreign shows. In the end, it doesn’t deteriorate my opinion because I actually enjoy them.

Furthermore, the speed the shows are updated bother me quite a bit. I get that there is a variety of shows to pick from, which keeps it interesting, the pace in which it gets new episodes is incredibly annoying. (Not including Netflix specials.)

Other than that, and a few other smaller problems, it’s a good app and highly recommend it to those of all ages."
2019-03-27 02:15:04,Netflix,5,Minimika70,False,"As much as I like Netflix. Lately, I see the same titles I have watched. Another thing, when you are viewing the screen it does not allow you to choose any further. Where you browse it just starts playing  without giving you a chance to read more details. So I have to stop. Then rummage around to where I started. Auto play is too quick and I have had to either close or get frustrated and just go and feel like an idiot. 
The titles have not changed. There so many new movies that have come and gone but they are not available   Please don’t get me wrong. 
I do think Netflix is Awesome."

2019-03-11 22:55:18,Amazing 😻💓✨,5,why just why -_-,False,"OMG I LOVE NETFLIX! 🌺💛 It’s one of the best show things everrrr. I do have some request though, it’d be nice if you could do this. 🥰 So, I would like for you to take off some shows and put on Jessie, Bella and the bulldogs, dog with a blog, Austin and Ally, Bad hair day the movie, Teen beach movie, and Goldbergs. I would also like you to keep a lot of the shows on Netflix for forever. For example, friends, miracle, who was show, 70s show, daddy daycare, mako mermaids, impractical joker, and anger management. Those are my favorite shows and some shows I miss that I would like for you to add. Thank you. Remember you don’t need to add these but it’d be super nice of you to. Thanks for reading:)"
2018-08-04 00:53:06,Good luck figuring out what you’d like to watch,1,Canan1,False,"I AM ON THE VERGE OF DELETING MY MEMBERSHIP!!! They have recently deleted summary of movies/shows. Other than a genre we get no information. I’m not in the least bit interested in switching between the app and the internet to figure out what a movie is about. It doesn’t even give information about who is in the movie. All you get is a promo picture, movie title and genre while using the app. The website has more information about the movies but it doesn’t give the option to add the movie to your list if your interested in watching it. So you have to look through their webpage to figure out which movies you’d like to watch and then switch to their app and add it to your list. I think it’s a fair expectation to be able to do it all in the same place when I’m paying $10+ a month for your services."
2018-07-31 23:11:27,Was great till recently,3,Saintmikhael,False,"They added a recently watched pop up at the bottom which is always in the way of scrolling. I have to close it every time I open the app which is annoying. Then just a few days ago show descriptions disappeared. Idk if it’s a glitch or a terrible decision but they have to come back. I spent ten minutes looking for a work around, which I found you can click on the thumbnail moderately hard and it will pop up with a mini description. This is very annoying to do for every movie that looks like it may be interesting. Don’t make me go to imbd for every show I’m interested in please!

Everything else about the app is great and the movies and shows are great. Just a few bad choices recently."
2018-01-15 03:14:09,Ummmm,3,atkiko,False,Netflix is great and all. And with my iPhoneX watching movies is phenomenal but when you don’t have WiFi. It’s kind of hard to watch movies on my tv from nextflix. I took my time and spent $53 to get an adapter for my hdmi and lightning adapter to view movies off my phone. Well when I click on the app. And begin to watch a movie I see that it’s loading on both my phone and the tv. But as soon as it start to play. The movie freezes on the tv but continues to play on my phone. I’ve done a little research and found that it isn’t my phone nor is it the tv. Neither is it the cord I have chosen. Apparently Netflix doesn’t completely support streaming with  the ios version I have. I’m a little lost on what do do and would love to have some advice.
2019-06-11 00:42:22,Netflix is good 🙂,4,lives451011,False,Netflix is really good I always love watching my favorite movies  like  my baby sister is a vampire and Malibu rescue and h20 just add water I watch those all the time Netflix is good for kids to there is a lot of kid show there is only one thing I don’t like about Netflix I will watch something one day then the next day it is gone because it was old 😒 and I think that’s dum just because it is old doesn’t mean that it is bad and they only reason they deleted it is because they need room for more new movies but I think they should be able to have lots of old movies and new movies so that’s it I love Netflix but that was the only thing I didn’t like so that’s it bye😋😚😊😄😀☺️😊😋😘❤️
2019-12-22 01:29:51,Season 4 of Anne with E!!!,5,honest as can be❤️,False,"OK listen Netflix, I know that I shouldn't really be writing a review for this but you need to make a season 4 of Anne with an e it's an awesome show and so many people watch it. Not only that but I love how it sets an olden type theme!! And also just when Gilbert and Anne finally get together you cancel it, it also gives a lot of motivation to all the woman and girls watching it.  It's basically telling all the girls out there watching it that you can be and do anything you want to do!!! Old don't cancel this show and make a season 4!! Thank you for making a very reliable app and having good shows but pls listen to my cause❤️"

2019-07-29 15:56:13,Good but some stupid recommendations/suggestions,5,fangirl1230,False,"I love Netflix. I have always loved it and always will. I don’t think I have any beef with it at all except for the fact that there are some really annoying recommendations and suggested shows/movies. For example: I am not the biggest fan of the movie Spider-Man Into The Spiderverse (no offense to anyone who likes it, just not my cup of tea😊), yet I still continuously get recommendations and suggestions to watch it even though I gave it a thumbs down. Overall though, great app and I hope you definitely consider downloading it. Thanks for taking the time to read this and have a great day!"
2019-02-20 04:31:12,Some suggestions,4,aileverte,False,"The app is great, selection of films leaves vast room for improvement (more film classics, more independent films would be great).

In terms of function, I often find I wish there was an easy way of removing movies from the “continue watching” list (you can do it on Brit Box which overall is a more primitive app): when you start watching sth and 10 mins into the film realize this is decidedly not your cup of tea, it seems you’re stuck with it. One can of course go to account settings on a browser, but it is tedious and I rarely access Netflix on the computer. 

Hope you can add a delete button in the corner of the thumbnail! That would be appreciated!"
2019-04-24 06:01:43,Not ADA friendly,3,Wkringle,False,"As my family peruses through the movies trying to find something that looks like it’s going to be a great action/adventure movie, we have to start the movie and watch 5-10 minutes of it only to find out that it only has English subtitles. Your description is in English and makes one think the movie will be also. A member of our family has limited eyesight and cannot read these subtitles and more and more of your offerings are not in English at all. It would be very helpful if it stated what language the movie is in so we don’t become disgruntled and waste so much time looking for something above sub-par. Netflix needs to get with the program and realize that thousands of Americans have visual limitations."
2019-03-15 17:20:11,some issues and a lack of stuff.....,3,tomato basil soup,False,"So I watched half of the first episode of the office months ago, never went back. Recently, I looked at the continue watching category and saw episode 2 there 3rd out of everything when the day before it was last. So it stays there for about a week and never moves no matter what I watch. Then, today I open it up and see it first and the movie I was watching literally 12 hrs ago (watching nothing else because of downtime)  is 8th. Then about 10 minutes later I reopen and it’s 5th! I don’t know what’s going on here Netflix.… 

Another thing, there’s a ton of things they don’t have! And why the heck did you get rid of Mean Girls?! They used to, but for some reason it’s not there. whyyyyyyy????"

I don’t really know how to put it, but if you tap on the screen while watching a show or movie, it’s shows the pause button and skip back skip forward button as well. When you press again and it goes away. When I press for it to go away it comes right back no matter how many times I press it. This is something that really annoying me. When I do manage to get it away the screen appears darker and you can still see the title of what you are watching and stuff like that. This is probably just me but I wanted to just put that out there. But overall this is a very good app and I enjoy it a lot"

This is just a suggestion, but I think I the app would be so much better if you were able to comment on movies and episodes of shows. I know that I would really enjoy being able to discuss each episode of my favourite shows. For instance I have been watching the show Criminal Minds, and in this episode they are working on a case in my state. I would like to know if it bothered anyone that they were mispronouncing the name of the county. After every episode I watch I always think about the things I would like to discuss about the episode. I believe it would be nice to discuss things with other watchers."

This is great. However, I have had some problems with the download feature. Sometimes, an episode just won’t download. It comes with no error message or is stuck on queue. I have researched extensively to find what the issue could be but the only working solution I have found is to delete and reinstall the app. I hope some fixes can be made or that there is a better solution as I don’t want to have to keep deleting and reinstalling to fix a simple problem. Overall though amazing app, def recommend."
2019-09-08 23:01:20,Nice app!,5,kiddos preseschool,False,"Netflix is really good and allows me to watch hundreds of movies, cartoons, TV shows, and documentaries. I enjoy how you can make separate accounts for different people as they have different interests and favorites. I also love how a few months after a new movie has been released, Netflix has it. Kids movies are endless and will keep children entertained while adult movies are just as good. It’s very convenient that I can watch on TV, Phone, and IPad. There’s nothing negative in my review. Netflix is truly a great app that I enjoy. Thank you for allowing people do watch their favorite TV shows and movies! Keep on the good work!"

But I’ve been finishing up with the anime fairy tail and I love it to bits and pieces! And when I finished watching it I did notice that there is way more seasons to the anime then Netflix has to offer. I couldn’t find a better quality app to use other then Netflix. I was really hoping that if I wait Netflix will add more seasons and movies to fairy tail. I’m sorry if there is a reason why you can’t do another season or movies about this. But I would love to see all the seasons on Netflix very soon. Over all I love this app but there is one complaint.

It’s very limiting and I feel like with this option for a more precise rating, I could have customized my watch history and list to something a little more “me.” And second; sometimes with each new update comes a new bug whether that being small or big, but it can be irritating especially when it’s something like a movie won’t play or you can’t tap on something, or you can’t add to your list, etc."

are changing and theirs not as many things for teens as there is for kids and adults. That being said I think that, 1, you need to have more of a selection for teens and 2, I think on the app there should be a suggestion section so that you know what your users would like to see instead of what you recommend them because sometimes the recommendations aren't the most accurate. Over all I love the app and I think that the thoughts that w not into it are brilliant so keep on working hard!"

The only thing I don’t like about it is all my seasons are behind.. like I have watched Riverdale u til season 3 and people are saying season 5 is already coming out and I haven’t seen season 4! It says season 4 is coming out on May 14th but I’ve heard many people say that there has already been a season 4 and that’s when season 5 is coming out! I don’t know what to believe but I watched a video thinking I’ve already watched all that has come out and it said that Archies dad passed away and it said it was in season 4! I’m not sure what’s going on.. can come one please help me?

2019-05-08 23:38:15,Request please read could help with amount of people watching Netflix,5,yaya1w12,False,Great but I have a request I hope you consider. My request is for you to put Wonder on kids Netflix. A reason I want this is because my parents won’t let me watch it in the living room because my brother doesn’t like it. I have a tv with Netflix in my room so that would work wonderfully. Another reason is because Wonder is a very heartfelt movie and many people like me love those kind of movies. Now that you have read my request I would hope you could consider putting Wonder on kids Netflix thank you very much

The Clone wars was better than half the prequels and WWWAAAYYYYY better than anything Disney has made or has even thought of making. Please, PLEASE bring the Clone Wars Back. I’ll do anything. I’ll take out a loan and pay for whatever license or paperwork you have to sign or pay with Disney. So many people loved the Clone Wars, and now those people won’t be able to watch it unless they buy the DVDs. I used to watch this show every day. I’ve probably rewatched it over 20 times. And that’s not exaggerating. Well, at least you didn’t take Red vs Blue from us."
2018-08-26 05:27:40,"Great service, annoying app design",3,Boznoko338,False,"Netflix is an awesome service, but I've found two things about the design of their app to be increasingly annoying. 

First, PLEASE stop automatically playing videos when I'm flipping through them looking for something to watch. This has to be THE most annoying thing in the world, I literally don't know anyone who likes that Netflix does this.

Secondly, could you guys stop changing the thumbnail images for your shows and movies every few days? All it does is get me excited because I think the new thumbnail means you've added new episodes of one of my favorite shows, and then disappointed when I realize that all you've done is change the thumbnail for no reason."

So I had an idea that would be good for all of the kids like me who can’t watch Netflix: I was thinking that if it was possible, you guys could make a separate app, where the parents sign in with their account, but it would be a separate account for the kid, but the parents get to chose what shows/ movies the kids could watch. I really hope that you will consider this because that would be amazing!! Thank you for reading my suggestion!!"
2018-06-30 16:57:26,Why should I continue to pay,1,Kbstudent,False,"Ever since the last big update where Netflix totally changed their look on the app, it has been completely useless for me. I can still watch shows and movies, but it doesn’t save my spot in shows, it doesn’t even remember what shows I was watching! Now I have to remember the exactly minute I was on when watching an episode because it doesn’t remember anything. I have to search up the show to find it as well. I should honestly just buy the DVDs of the show at this point because at least I could pause it and come back to my spot. I think it’s ridiculous and I find myself not wanting to watch anything because I have so many things to keep track of just on this app. Time to get it together Netflix. I’m frustrated with your services which I used to love. I hope it gets better."
2018-06-25 06:17:33,Need to rethink updates,3,D!293):,False,"Awesome streaming app with quality picture (if you pay extra). However, ever since Netflix Originals have been coming out, their updates have taken away some fantastic shows (like The X-Files, Malcolm in the Middle, and other fantastic classics). Their updates have taken away the star ratings and added percentage match which is no help in trying to find a new, good show; for it doesn’t rate quality, just commonality. My main concern is being halfway through completing a series and Netflix takes away the series with the update. Also, it could have a more extensive 4K category. A lot of the shows in 4K are in the drama category. Great app, don’t recommend as your only source of tv though."
2018-05-14 01:50:24,Please update,3,lover yet hater,False,"I have watched many tv shows and I was very satisfied that most them are finished, but when I am watching one that is unfinished it seems you never keep up with the updates. For example, The Fosters it is an unfinished show on Netflix not sure on other apps, but it has been a very long time since an update has happened. A recommendation I suggest is that you should notify people if you will discontinue a show instead of leaving us dumbfounded if you will continue it or not. Honestly I love this app but I’m really starting to think if I should use another because of how slow it takes to update series. Or try to make notifications on which app is continuing the show more recent."

2020-06-01 17:17:45,Would like a Sequel,5,sherry sophie,False,"Ok I’m a kid using my brothers account.

Nothing is wrong with that but I started to get really into ‘Avatar the last air bender’ when I finished it I heard there was a sequel ‘Legend of Korra’ I was able to watch the first two videos and I wanted to see more. So I though it was easier to tell you than try to look even further into the internet. I know you have been adding new stuff to Netflix a lot, this also might sounds a bit selfish, and I gave you a 5 star review so that means you don’t have to do anything. Still can you please try to get the sequel if you do I will be so happy. Thank you! :)"
2019-07-19 18:33:36,Why aren’t tv series being uploaded,4,MAGIKALHORSE,False,In one of the tv series ( the tales of ladybug and catnoir) aren’t always uploaded. For example while I’m stuck on season 2 everyone is on season 3 at first I started to watch it on Nickelodeon but when I didn’t see it anymore on the app I went to Netflix and Netflix doesn’t upload the videos until the whole series is finished which gets me irritated because I just want to the show but I can’t because I have to wait for the arrivals I’m sorry for being rude but it’s true I just want to watch the show without having to wait until the season is finish for it to be uploaded. Thank for understanding if you read this.
2020-02-19 11:55:11,New version keeps changing the audio language,1,luma.81,False,"Unfortunately after so many years I’m leaving Netflix. It has been a couple of weeks since Netflix has decided to auto select the language of every series/film I choose - most probably based on my location. This is an example where the artificial “intelligence” work against the plan. You don’t know me, you don’t know whether I’m an expat... leave the language of my app alone. It’s SUPER annoying! Even when you are watching a series on a row, the next episode, that initiates automatically, it changes the language back from the previous language you’ve just adjusted! It’s... super super annoying. Can’t take it any longer. I’ve been testing other streams meanwhile - at lest they respect the language choice I make (instead of trying “intelligently” adjusting it for me)"
2019-06-21 14:23:15,One obnoxious bug,4,zivotsky,False,"Works pretty good but there’s one bug they really need to work on. Often times I’ll be watching a show and when it ends and moves on to the next episode I’ll get the spinning wheel. The episode will not load. I’ll close out the program and try again but no go. The only thing that works is shutting down and restarting my iPad. This also happens if I’m watching a movie and I happen to stop to open up a browser to maybe check the weather or something. Go back to resume the movie and same thing, spinning wheel until I shut the tablet down, restart it, and reopen the program. I really wish they’d address this issue."
2019-01-19 16:24:30,Really good... but...,4,#Tigress,False,"I love Netflix and it is definitely really good. Now just because you read this review, don’t think it’s a bad app, cause it’s not!
It’s really good just it can be very glitchy and really annoying when you can to restart it over and over again. This has happened to me many times before. Another thing is, it won’t let you watch anything if 2 people are on your account already. This can be very annoying. As a teacher, when I try to put this on for my students, I share an account with my family so most of the time it won’t let us play anything. Overall, it is really good though. Very good app, just a few bugs."
2018-03-19 21:21:12,98% match?,3,Hardest_To_Impress,False,"Here’s how the recommendation system in Netflix works:

1. Netflix will recommend movies based on your watch history. (Good)

2. Netflix will annoy you with them. (Not so good)

3. You don’t feel like watching them. (Now that’s bad)

4. Netflix recommends a whole lot more movies based on your watch history (Bad)

5. You fall into a trap hole of recommended movies (Terrible)

A huge list of recommended TV shows that I DO NOT like:

Stretch Armstrong - 97% match
Johnny Test - 97% match
Zap Storm - 95% match
Dragons Race To The Edge - 98% match
Trolls The Beat Goes On! - 98% match
Beyblade Metal Fusion - 98% match
The Emoji Movie - 98% match

And a whole lot more movies and TV shows..

I also hate that some movies/TV shows are directed for little kids.

For example, Netflix classifies The Emoji Movie as a movie for kids 5-7. Well, some adults may want to watch this movie but if it says “For kids ages 5-7” the adult will know that he is too old for this movie. 

This is kinda like saying “This movie is NOT for people over the age of 7”

And that’ll just spoil the movie to older kids and adults.

Plz respond to me and say something that’ll be helpful and resolve this issue."
2018-10-25 19:32:38,Like but boring,2,Jamesoch🤪🤩,False,To start this off I’d like to say that Netflix is really good I really love the downloads and watch without wifi BUT I really dislike the fact that you guys can’t add movies that recently came out in theaters a lot of the times I have to wait more than 4months just so I can enjoy a move but by the time that movie comes out on Netflix I don’t watch it cause it’s already been spoiled and that really annoys and also I hate that Netflix needs a lot of WiFi just to start running well sometimes I get so mad cause I have to wait and wait until I see something pop up saying that an error occurred and come back when you have better connection yet I look at the corner and I have more than 2 bars of connection that’s why I’m giving you two stars period.😤😡😠
2018-08-18 20:41:54,Amazing,5,MEliseL,False,I absolutely love this app and so does everyone I know that has it. I just wanted to see of you guys can make an update and I will explain about what in the next sentence but first I wanted to say who ever came up with this app is a genius. Ok you see I have recently got a vr headset and I love it. So I wanted to see if you can make a split screen version of Netflix that allows me to watch it on the headset. I am no expert but I’m pretty sure what I’m asking is a big thing for you guys so I understand if you don’t. But if you do that would be amazing thank you so much for reading my feed back hope to hear from you soon. Bye!
2018-08-02 23:26:24,change these updates,2,La La🖤,False,Netflix has downgraded in the past few years why don’t they still have Jessie or mean girls or cloudy with a chance of meatballs I say take off the shows that no one really watches any more and add new ones in there place because I don’t like any of these new changes. I went out of the country a couple months ago and the had all of the original movies and it was awesome but right when I came back to America they changed and it had all of the new shows that no one has even heard or before they take off most of the shows that everyone loves and just added terrible shows if Netflix looks at these reviews you guys will get and have more money if you guys add back the others shows because you will get good money and a lot more.
2018-02-17 02:41:18,I love the service but I have some feedback. . .,3,Shafferm,False,I love the service but I think that there is one feature that would make it even better.  When you have a family account your are able to make up to five profiles but there is no way to add a password to them.  Being one of three children I have experienced first hand the anger that comes when you log onto Netflix and see that your sibling has gone onto your account and made you lose your place in a show.  Netflix needs to add a password to the profiles. It dosent have to be mandatory when you set up a profile but it should definitely be available.  It would just about the only flaw that I can find with Netflix. :)
2019-09-28 22:05:46,Please stop deleting movies and series,4,A. She'd,False,I just wanted to say what happened to turbo max I loved that series until you cut it out of nowhere . Than you cut wolf blood and one fo my favorite anime series that is why I gave you four star rating if you can please put all the movies and series back .Evan my friends are talking about it and I bet it is a matter of time before all my favorite movies and series go away so please put them all back I hope you do so because I love Netflix and I dont want all my favorite movie and series to go up in flames so please put them back .I really hope you read this and understand what I am trying to say than you cut it without warning
2017-11-28 11:15:27,Great!,5,Berryjuicessnobber,False,"I love Netflix! I love binge watching a whole season of my favorite show in Netflix and one of the reasons why I chose Netflix over other platforms is because Netflix has really good Netflix Originals that I obviously can't find in other platforms examples of good Netflix originals are 13 reasons why,Lemonny Snicket's series of unfortunate events,Atypical etc. I can't find these good tv series on other platforms and these tv shows are just too good to miss so I chose Netflix,Oh, and additional note, I like how Netflix allows old ios devices to download it's old version because other apps can't do that only some can.  :) Good Job Netflix!"
2017-11-26 06:09:38,One of the most used apps with the least features,2,Paul1356789,False,"The Netflix mobile app lacks so much in functionality. There is no longer a rewind feature, never had a fast forward feature and the scrubbing slider doesn’t allow for small increments of FF or RWD. Would be is a double tap to the left of the play button rewinded and the right side respectively. Even allowing for an up and down slide to control volume would be nice. 

I find it such a hassle to watch anything on my mobile phone because of the extreme lack of innovation. Allowing for picture picture outside the app may be a difficult task to create with the app, but it’s not even supported within the app. Really hope these ideas are considered in order to make a more user friendly experience."
2020-01-18 15:14:47,great but not,3,lisa.mono,False,"so don’t get me wrong, netflix is really a great thing and i love their netflix originals shows and series and they got some dope movies and a lot of choice, HOWEVER, not every country has same content., like im in europe and i don’t have at least 10 dramas that i want to watch on netflix, and the us/asian netflix have them. and since we’re paying all the same for the same app then i think we should all have and the same content. and ofc you can always find some of those movies, series and shows on other platforms if you don’t have them on your netflix, but why would i if people from usa can watch it on netflix, then i in europe can too. come on netflix, give us all the same treatment"

2019-06-18 22:47:19,Great app with one or two problems,4,WetzelPretzel4937,False,"I love Netflix it’s awesome my whole household use it. But Netflix has a problem with getting rid of good and entertaining shows and movies. I have wrote this issue to Netflix so I’m not going behind their back but they got rid of a lot of great entertainment like “ Doctor Who “, “ Penelope “, and “ Total Drama Island “. These are just a few names but other then this issue Netflix is a amazing way to stream new tv shows and to watch the latest movies. I would definitely recommend this app for everyone all ages. Like I said my family also uses the app which is a great way to have a family plan. I completely recommend this app."
2018-11-08 03:53:58,Feedback for subtitles,4,MiayeRose,False,"Please add the option to change the color and size of the subtitles. It can be hard to read them when they are on light colored backgrounds. Example: I’m watching a show where several episodes take place in a hospital and the white subtitles on white hospital walls, floors and hospital gowns are causing some of the words to not display clearly. Also, the timing of the subtitles can be very off. It’s happened on more than one occasion where 2 people will exchange a few lines and the subtitles will flash rapidly after their exchange I’m guessing conveying what they said. I appreciate your time and I hope this improvement will be made in the future."
2019-01-18 03:43:36,Updates keep getting worse,3,Fran210,False,"I love using Netflix but lately I’ve been dreading all the new updates. Firstly, my “continue watching” tab is constantly moving making it aggravating to have to scroll to look for it. Just make it the first thing I see! Also, I dislike the fact that content plays automatically if you hover over it for too long. Most of the the time whatever is on the spotlight is not something I’m remotely interested in watching. A little more customization on the home page would be appreciated. Lastly, going back to the old rating system would be appreciated. Sometimes a thumbs down is too harsh for a movie but giving it a thumbs up is no good either."
2018-08-10 03:25:08,Can be Improved,3,awkward._.flower,False,"Tip: Add some more movies. “Which ones?” The ones that get searched up the most but you guys don’t have “But there’s not enough storage for more” Then get rid of the movies and tv shows that have the worst ratings. “But we don’t have enough money to purchase the rights to have the movie” Sorry, but don’t spend your money of making Netflix Originals 

Another tip: Allow your audience to be able to see more about the movie like why the movie rating is G, PG, etc., the cast and some of their work, the movies rating.

Another tip: Allow more movies and shows to be downloaded and for movies to be allowed to be removed from “Continued Watching” so the “Since you watched...” will not show and to hid you watched something 😂"
2017-09-27 23:49:30,App for iPhone is useless,5,MelB!,False,"Update: Heyyy, there we go. Finally got this bad boy working on iPhone. Danke.

Update: The Sept 21st update hasn't fixed anything. The Netflix app is still completely unusable on my iPhone.

I've been unable to use this app on my phone for weeks. Receive ""Unable to connect to Netflix. Please try again later"" when attempting to watch any title whatsoever. Wifi connection is fine, have updated, uninstalled/reinstalled. Nothing helps. If you're looking to purchase this service for the express purpose of watching anything on your mobile device, don't. It's a rip off."
2020-08-09 03:32:50,What happened to the watch bar?!?,3,GeGe873,False,"I gave this app 3 stars because I’ve had it for a long time and honestly it’s really good, but the new update messed it up. I thought it was just me until I checked out the latest reviews, but basically what happened is Netflix kinda took away the watch bar! Now every time you finish an episode or even a whole tv show, it doesn’t show. This is kinda misleading and made it harder for me to keep track of which episode I’m on in each series. I haven’t thought much of it but it’s starting to make me mad since some episodes seem as if I skipped them and others like I’ve watched them halfway! If you can fix this Netflix, I’ll give you 5 stars! I’ll be waiting."
2020-07-06 14:24:06,Great but having a bug issue,5,awildsoul,False,"I’ve been using Netflix for years and it’s a terrific app don’t get me wrong. But for the last few days I’ve been having a bug issue, especially on Mobile. Lately, if I happen to pause an episode and leave the app, whenever I return there’s an issue. It will completely restart the episode back to the beginning, and so I’ll have to voluntarily scroll through the episode until I find the place I was once at. This is happen for new shows I have not watched as well as rewatching previous ones. Please fix this issue asap! Thanks!"
2020-05-15 18:19:31,Brightness and screen lock,5,rainbowreview,False,"I love netflix, but these two new additions could be better. The brightness thing on the side is just plain annoying. I specifically set it to full brightness and then I left the app and came back and the brightness was at around 90% and I keep accidentally touching the brightness bar. The screen lock is a nice feature, but it could honestly be better. You should at least be able to pause and double tap to go forward or back on screen lock. It’s annoying having to take off screen lock to pause and fast forward."
2020-04-10 04:20:12,More finished anime,3,jaudhw,False,"Okay, to start off I love Netflix. I’ve been using this app for years because it’s easy and well it has cool and amazing series from time to time. I don’t always watch anime, but I’m very dissatisfied with this app a little. Because I watched on Netflix party with my girlfriend Danmachi on Netflix party. I loved the entire first season and we enjoyed it a lot. And we where anxious to know when was the second season going to air. But sadly there won’t be a second season on Netflix. Why is it that certain animes are not completed or continued on Netflix? Why tease us like this? Like please continue series that are this cool completely. Don’t just tease us and then leave out. Like come on, give the anime community finished content."
2019-12-22 03:45:30,You brought this on yourselves,1,5:28tesalonicenses,False,"I mean I used to enjoy watching movies with my family but then I noticed that you are disrespectful, I am full on Christian and I’m not embarrassed to say it this is really wrong by your part, why does lgbt ask for respect when they don’t give it back, I don’t care if you think I’m crazy that’s what’s least important To me right now, this “show or episode” will bring you to your end if you don’t notice your mistake it’s just ridiculous how you bring yourselves down to that level why can’t you be mature and know that what you have done is a great disrespect towards the creator you and I  might not have the same mindset of religion but what I have isn’t religion, Netflix I hope you open your immature eyes and realize what you’ve done isn’t ok, you’ve offended many people but in a great way you’ve offended God"
2019-08-29 04:40:12,Friends show,5,kyarraj101,False,"Please don’t take friends off take something else off like those stupid kid movies I love that show my whole family watches in fact it’s a family tradition every Friday we watch friends please don’t take it off at the end of the month. Also I think u should put Bernie mac, notebook, and Malcom’s in the middle back on Netflix I would really appreciate it if I fulfilled my wishes . Also btw I love Netflix that’s my favorite app to watch movies or shows.

2018-08-30 13:45:25,Good App with One Annoying Issue,4,doughboybjp,False,"I use the Netflix app all the time. It’s very user friendly. I also downloaded a movie that I took on an airplane last year. That’s a good feature. My big annoyance with the app is the automatic playing of videos when the app launches. At the top of the app, there’s a section that plays trailers for Netflix content that starts (complete with unwanted audio) within seconds of launching the app. I quickly scroll down the screen so that the video doesn’t play. From what I can tell, there’s no way to disable the auto-launch option. Please give us the option to either not launch the trailers or to launch them muted."
2018-06-29 07:21:08,Great app. I have some improvement ideas.,4,Casper the bot slayer,False,I love Netflix but some things could be fixed/changed when watching something (I’m watching supergirl don’t know if other shows or movies have same layout when watching) but the episodes audio&subtitles and next episode buttons could be moved to the top right of the screen the 10 seconds back pause/play and 10 seconds forward buttons moved to the bottom left and the Percentage bar more to the bottom of the screen all that would make it look better and have more screen space for when your looking to see how much longer the show/movie has to go.
2020-09-29 04:18:41,Annoying bug,4,TheFrump,False,"Especially on the windows version, Netflix has had a few problems but the most annoying one is, if I rewind too much or sometimes at all, it crashes, and then won’t open the next 5 or so times I click on it. I’ve tried everything and re-downloaded multiple times with the same issue.

And I say this for many, I also recommend making a widget of this, not only would that be useful in an advertising point but it really just would be nice to have;; an ex of something it could do would be to display recently watched or start a recently watched in picture-in-picture"
2020-06-18 10:31:06,Please make it free,5,Sandrooooo12e344,False,"This app is so great, I always wish to download it, but the only problem is that it needs to pay to watch movies. I know, thats the point but I just wish that it was free because I don't wanna spend money on movies. Maybe I just turn it on and I don't like it? Then what about my money? That's the improvement I want but I know no one will ever see this and ever do my wish, but if you do, plase make some movies free. The app is overall great and I just can't find another movie app like this but the reason I don't download this is that the movies are priced and often very expensive."
2020-04-25 03:57:55,"Amazing! I have a few suggestions, though.",4,kxydencee,False,"Netflix is an amazing app. They have great shows to watch and I really enjoy the app. I have a few suggestions for the app though. 

First, we should have more sections. The kids section has a bunch of shows, but a lot of them are more aimed towards 3-8 year olds instead of all ages. There should be more sections like the toddler section for 1-6 year olds, a kids section for 7-10 year olds, a preteen section for 11-14 year olds, teen section for 15-17 year olds, and the adult section for everyone 18+. I feel like it would just be way more organized that way. The teen section should have a few cuss words as long as it isn’t excessive. 

Two, please make a setting where you can turn off the “Are you still watching” prompt. It honestly gets so annoying when I’m watching a show that I’ve been sitting and watching for hours. 

There is probably many more things that could be improved about Netflix, but these are the two suggestions I could think of and quickly type."
2019-02-14 23:25:36,I love Netflix!,4,CupcakeCat115,False,"I’ve been watching Netflix since about 2009. I loved it then and I still love it now! I just wish that you would add some of your shows back. I understand that there’s a contract and it’s hard to do, but I still wish you could do that. But I think you’ve just removed some of them just because you want to. For example, Littlest Pet Shop and My Little Pony (I know they are baby shows 😂)  are made by the same company (Hasbro). Yet you removed Littlest Pet Shop and kept My Little Pony!! I wish you wouldn’t remove shows just because you want to because some of those shows mean a lot to people. Anyways, other than that I love Netflix 😁."
2020-04-07 19:12:14,Too many originals,2,老覃83,False,"Netflix used to have loads of good movies, and I could watch for centuries on, but now there’s just too many originals. They took out all of the good movies like Legally Blonde, Footloose, Mean Girls, Heathers, etc. and instead switched them out for a ton of bad Netflix originals. Don’t get me wrong, some of them are okay, though the majority are movies with no plot and just overall boring. It’s obviously cheaper for Netflix to just make their own movies, but what about entertainment wise? We want the good movies back, not the new ones Netflix filmed themselves. Often, I find myself scrolling though Netflix just to leave and go on another site to choose some other movie(s) to watch. Netflix is an okay site, but its movies are just less and less interesting and fun to watch."
2019-12-29 06:32:39,The vampire diaries,5,alyssa (Gabby i go by both),False,"Hey I was on the last episode of the vampire diaries and I go to finish it and it is not there anywhere I tried searching and it is it there. I look on my sister’s account and it pulls up on there? Then I was rewatching Gilmore Girls and I finished it and I tried looking it up and it was not there? So can pls respond and tell me what is wrong. I really want to finish The. Vampire diaries. Respond ASAP

I found the reason why. I was looking at my account and I say that my account was changed to kids account because my played a joke on my to see what I would do because she knows I love the vampire diaries. But problem solved."
2019-07-16 23:17:49,Free trail,1,TazblackCat,False,"Was never told when I signed up, that you could not use certain devices. When I bought a smart TV off of someone at a Garage Sale, I wasn't told it had already had a Netflix free trail on it. So when I signed up for Netflix on my phone, I was never asked if any of the devices I have had use Netflix free trail at some point in time. I tried to use it on the TV the next day, it said I had to pay  for the usage before my free trail was over. They were trying to bully me into paying for something that was supposed to be free for 30 days. That is one of their many hidden details they do not tell you about. So people beware. If you bought a Smart TV off of someone and they had Netflix on it before, you will have your free trail revoked and they will try and force you to pay. Wish I knew about this before I signed up."
2019-05-30 16:06:27,PRO CHOICE,5,nnaattii_,False,"Netflix is a great source of entertainment and honestly when I heard that they’re going shading the abortion laws in Georgia I couldn’t have been happier. It’s important when big corporations put an opinion out there and go for what they believe is right. To anyone who is saying that it’s just their job to entertain and you’re going to stop watching and unsubscribe just because you’re pro life, then just be quiet. They have millions of more customers that agree with what they’re trying to do,  support their choice AND love their entertainment. Netflix is standing up and it’s good to say that it’s not for the wrong thing."
2020-03-28 23:08:24,Anime Episodes,4,Taylr_oo,False,"I love Netflix, just lots of things about it is amazing!  The reason why I’m here is because I want to discuss the anime episodes and shows. Okay on Netflix there are a lot of anime shows, but the problem is that most shows don’t have all the episodes! I mean if you’re gonna put an anime show on Netflix, at least add all the anime episodes! Another thing is that if you have an anime that will continue to another anime series, you should add it to Netflix! Example: (Naruto = Naruto Shippunden = Boruto) I also think that you should add more animes to Netflix. (That part is optional) I love Netflix a lot but please at least see this review on what I think about it!"
2018-12-15 20:52:37,Flipping amazing,5,yokinishi2100,False,"I am so addicted to watch every day for at least more than two hours and my favorite shows are like super monsters and there's another one that I love which is called creeped out which is the newest show so I think a lot of people love that if they start watching it and it just I love the shows and movies that you put on there so  i'm going to go watch some right now I love it I have to say ✌️🙂🙂🙂🙂😃also I would love if you guys would add ""The Haunting Hour"" back on cause I love that show (aka I love ""Spirit Riding Free"" which means I've watched all 7 seasons 5 times in a row so it's pretty awesome and I'm proud of it!😊)"
2017-12-18 14:05:10,Annoying how only half of seasons of series,3,Hart 33,False,I do enjoy watching Netflix when their is nothing else to do but it really annoys me how let's say their is 5 seasons of a show and Netflix only has 2 of those seasons. Like with the flash their is 4 season and you only get 2 I am from South Africa and this is the case with all series and I understand that like with the flash they are still making season 4 so obviously you can't put season 4 up yet but atleast put season 3 with ended more then a year ago.    I have put in suggestions more then once.    And don't use that excuse that you don't have permission as in America they have season 4 of flash on Netflix but in South Africa we only recently got season 2 and it was made in 2015
2020-07-02 23:17:07,In my opinion,5,A fan of this but how I feel,False,Netflix is a really good app to watch movies shows but Netflix also has a log people outAnd Netflix they log me my sister in some few friends and we couldn’t login so I couldn’t watch Riverdale or vampire diary already had to wait two months to get Netflix back so my sister log back in and it worked and for me they asked me to pay to download Netflix that never happens to me but now I can’t watch Riverdale anymore or I can’t watch nothing from Netflix it’s a really good app but I just don’t like how they log me out and they’re making me pay Netflix just to download it
2019-05-30 12:47:03,iphone 7:Auto play / browse phone while  dock connector,4,GeminiSzn,False,"Netflix, I enjoy your app everyday from my iphone 7 connected to a dock connector. the app runs smoothly but it would be amazing if you guys allowed an auto play after TV shows and movies like you guys do for ones using other means of streaming. Or it would be nice to have the movie keep playing if you go to the home screen but the user doesn’t close the app (when you’re playing through a dock connector). it’s kind of tedious having to keep your phone locked while watching a movie, but i can’t reply to messages or browse through my phone while a movie is playing."
2020-03-16 21:41:13,Bring back F.r.i.e.n.d.s 😣😭😢😖,5,Don'tquestionme,False,"Okay so I think Netflix is a convenient, simple way to watch all of your favorite titles. The only thing that bothers me is that Netflix removes some of my favorite shows that keep me paying for Netflix, for instance they removed F.r.i.e.n.d.s, how I met your mother, and Futurama. See, there is really nothing wrong with this app, but I also wish they would add a teen section. With helpful categories it’s easy to find what I’m looking for. I love Netflix and in the end it’s worth having. Netflix please bring back F.r.i.e.n.d.s, how I met your mother, and Futurama. They were my favorite shows. P.S. this is from an eleven year old."
2019-10-28 18:24:40,Netflix Television Shows,5,Dr.Ms2Gees,False,"I love looking at television shows by seasons,episodes, especially without commercials . What’s lovely most of all you can choose episodes by going back through what you might of missed.
 I’d encourage you to pick movies from every kind of cgenre  gangster,romantic ,even how to do things can be found through live streaming get any of promoted Netflix offers.
 It’s reasonable with monthly payments, 
Customer Service Reps are very knowledgeable helpful they want you a satisfied customer. 
I’ve been an  Netflix faithful for over 20 years with no complaints or unfinished issues."
2019-08-15 21:28:06,New button suggestions,3,Lanfear1907,False,"Hey! Can you please add “seen” and “not interested” buttons to the content? For example, I started watching a show, and didnt like it. Removed it from my list. But it still “reminds” me to “keep watching” it from where I left off. I want it to disappear from my homepage. Also, not see it ever again, unless I specifically search for it. Or a recent season of a show that I watched on another platform keeps popping up because I watched the first season on netflix. But I’ve already seen it and dont want it to keep popping up. (Rating a thumbs up or down is not enough to make the content go away.) This makes new and interesting content very hard to find. Thanks in advance!"
2019-06-05 13:57:55,Awesome!,5,Lily Roughton,False,"I absolutely love Netflix. They have a very wide variety of TV shows and movies for all ages! One of my favorite things I love about Netflix is that you can add all of your favorite TV shoes and movies to your list, and come back and watch them anytime. It also saves the things that you watched so you can come back to it! Some of my favorite things to watch on Netflix are The series of Unfortunate Events, Stranger Things, MARVEL movies, Disney(which won’t be on Netflix much longer because Disney is making their own network), and Mako Mermaids! Overall an AWESOME app to watch all your favorite shows and movies!!!!"
2018-07-29 18:51:40,Cool Update.. but,4,THEBEASTKILLAH LOL!,False,"This update is an improvement in many aspects, all the options are now on the bottom instead of scattered around the screen. The play button is now in the middle, making it easier and more satisfying to use. The removal of the 10-second rewind button is now really starting to get annoying though, because I want to rewatch a funny part of an episode, but now I have to manually move the dial and it moves it back like a minute behind. It gets to the point where I regret even moving it back because I forget what I even wanted to see. Bring back the rewind button, and add a fast forward button. That’d be cool."

2020-06-18 09:46:13,Default Audio Settings,4,daTasman,False,"Please include default audio setting in the app or the app should continue with your last audio selection. For instance if I changed my audio to audio description, this should continue to be my default audio for any new movie until I changed it to something else.  It is annoying that I have to change the audio to original audio from audio description each time I want to watch a new movie, I just have a feeling that the app should be smart enough to know my audio preferences after changing the audio from audio description to original audio like 20 times already."
2020-02-24 21:32:29,Quick question,5,Kads12346,False,"This is not the most important thing, but I would to make a complement on the series, ‘Saiki K.’.  A few days ago, I was enjoying season 1 of this show. Until, I came upon season 2. Why exactly is it Japanese? I mean, yes, Japanese is the original language, but why have English for the first season and not the rest? Again, I understand that there’s Japanese, but if you could make there an option of having English, that would be appreciated. If you can’t do anything about it, I am perfectly okay with that. Thank you for your time. *Also please keep up to date with Haikyu. :)"
2018-06-04 06:55:04,Just one issue... otherwise great,4,Funny-josi,False,"I love the new layout of Netflix. Everything is much simpler to find (i.e. instead of all the romantic comedies being on your homepage, you can easily browse them in the search tab, love it!) and it has been great. However I’m a little disappointed by things you have removed from the app. Fast forwarding by 10-30 seconds is much easier with a little button and I often have the need to do so. Also, I agree that the system of rating the shows and movies could be improved. These are both things that were previously perfect but recently taken away. Otherwise, an awesome update."
2019-07-11 14:04:26,My Netflix is not working,3,whats wrong with my netfilx,False,My Netflix is not working like I get in and it keeps loading and I pronto know what’s wrong I called the Netflix company and there said it’s because I have iPhone and there working on something to fix I think if something like this is going to happen you imform the people like tell me if this is happening to you and it’s not because I don’t like Netflix because I do i live to watch grays anatomy but I can’t because of this and all the other shows I watch I feel like this needs to be fixed and until then this post will stay up till I re-edit it I really need to be fixed because what Else is going to happen plz be informed to the people thanks for understanding
2019-04-25 21:08:21,The app is less functional...,1,Amberlee357,False,"I don’t really have any issues with the content on Netflix or how it operates, but before you could access your account information through the app. Which plan you had, billing date, cost, change password, etc. Now you have to go to the internet to check these things?? Also, the “Help” section consists of the phone number to customer service - not actually any help topics to read about and possibly find the solution yourself. You have to actually CALL someone, which is not always convenient. Why on earth would I want to go to a different platform to check my information when I could do it before on the app? Why would I want to call customer service and be on hold when I could browse solutions? These are major steps backwards for an app, Netflix."
2018-11-23 18:10:23,Bad app,1,Luxor420,False,So I called and complained they allow a show called structure at Voyager on the kids menu because it has a PG rating. Because it has a PG rating they’re going to stick it in a child’s section.. Well I just watch season one episode 15 and I just talked about someone’s room girlfriend getting raped and her score smashed in. So I called and complained and told me they can’t do anything about it I can block it if I want but what about another parent that doesn’t know that they can block a showperiod My daughter was the one that found star check on their.  who is to say that she didn’t watch this episode. So their excuses for why has the PG rating in they don’t have anything to decide with the PG rating and I can block the show. Which is garbage there are plenty of other kids out their back and watch Star Trek and listen to the stuff
2020-08-06 03:16:40,Glitchy when watching shows,4,gmaryhb,False,"I’m not sure what’s going on with my Netflix app but lately it’s been really really glitchy.  When I’m watching a show, at the end of it, it won’t say next episode the credits will just keep rolling and when I press next episode manually, it starts over in the middle of the episode.  Also, recently all the tv shows that I’ve watched or are on my continue watching, it wiped the memory of which episodes I have watched.  For example, I’m on season 8 of criminal minds and when I go look at the past seasons it says I’ve never watched it, and that’s REALLY annoying to me, but overall I really love h The Netflix app"
2020-08-28 22:35:15,A Show Suggestion,5,Minako Yuki k,False,"Hi there Netflix! I am Minako. I was wondering if you could put a show back on Netflix. It’s called “Jessie” I really loved this show when I was very young and I still do now. It kills me, well not literally to have Jessie off of Netflix. I really don’t want to pay like 14 dollars for each episode or 2 dollars. So I would really appreciate it if you would put Jessie back on Netflix. I would love watching if with my cousins. And my cats. (￣▽￣) Since they haven’t seen it yet. And why not watch a fun good show with family. I really hope you agree. Also thank you Netflix company for the entertainment."
2019-11-02 00:53:21,Great but one thing,4,JustMonika.Chr,False,OK I love Netflix it’s like one of the best things in the world to give me all the shows I love but it just took off I’m not sure if it just took off the show but it’s one of my favorite shows and it is backstage and It added two new shows I think and what I wish Netflix would do is ask you if you wanted to replace blank and add blank the blank‘s mean like a show or a movie instead of just getting rid of it because maybe some people actually want to keep that show that you’re going to replace with that new one so please just add that feature  and ask for backstage again please but Besides that I love Netflix sooo much
2019-11-28 21:50:31,Downloads are buggy,1,max29297,False,"1 Star for visibility. Before my flight, I tapped to download several episodes of Breaking Bad. It displayed a warning saying that I could only download them 1 more time. Strange to act like I was running up against a limit, since I’ve never previously downloaded them. I continued, saw them begin to download, complete, etc. On my flight, I opened up the Netflix app, and they were all missing. Later episodes were there, but not the ones I specifically downloaded. I was furious. I got off the flight and tried to re-download, and now it says I can’t do so until next year. Unbelievable. It could have something to do with their “smart download” feature, which I’ve now turned off. But really? You delete an episode I specifically downloaded even though I hadn’t pressed ‘play’ once?"
2018-08-18 04:48:30,More consistency,4,ashleymaeze,False,"Don’t get me wrong, I absolutely love Netflix and it obviously has changed the way people watch entertainment; especially with their originals. I just wish they would be more consistently up to date with new content and stop removing so much. It’s a lot of waiting for them to add stuff, while they’re already removing older stuff, it’s a little frustrating. I also don’t get why they’ll have the second movie or later seasons, but not the first or beginning? Like Law and Order or Guardians of the Galaxy 2. Doesn’t make a lot of sense to me. Also to be able to customize more of what you see on the homepage would be nice."
2019-03-24 12:29:27,Make Netflix browser friendly AGAIN !,3,want netflix browser friendly,False,I want to be able to watch on my browser ! I don’t care about the app I hate the app I want to watch on my browser and be able to preview episodes before watching them honestly could care less about the app ! Want to be able to watch on browser that’s all fix it thank you. Please cause the app is pointless for me beyond pointless isn’t bad just not for me. Pretty sure I’m not the only person who would like to choose how I stream my content considering I’m paying for it I should have that option and freedom of not being tied down to an app. Especially considering I travel so ... please make that a thing in the new update. Thank you.
2019-02-17 22:50:31,This app is the best app in the history of apps but.........,5,# Love horses,False,This app is the best thing that I have ever got!😂😂 But all I wish is that new seasons download faster. One time the new season of bunked (third season) took a month after it came out to be on Netflix. Then my friends told me that it had come out. I looked it wasn’t there I restarted my iPad I even checked for updates.......NOTHING!😡 I had waited so long for that new season I looked on my iPad every day! It wasn’t there! But other then that this game is the best highly recommend it!😉 And thank you for your time to read this sorry it was so long.😔
2019-02-14 18:45:34,Very Upset!!,1,TheShelbla,False,"I just got an email that Netflix is going to start charging double what they used to!!! Netflix used to only charge 8 dollars and slowly they have doubled their price with literally no difference in the quality of the app. Just because it has became a larger company and now has millions of people using it doesn’t mean they should up charge and lose their value of their customers. I, and many will be undownloading and cancelling subscriptions. This is disappointing and irritating because its so obvious that netflix is NOT worth 17 bucks a month. They are slow about updating their shows and movies, and they dont have a large enough selection. If you are charging me the price of a brand new movie that just came out of theaters than I expect brand new movies... NOT a movie that came out 2 years ago."

I understand that it is likely due to whatever algorithm is being used to tailor my Netflix experience but even if I search ‘all movies’ or a genre of movies, there are still some options that do not show up on my page. I watch a variety of genres with varied subject matter. Rather than having to swipe left to view the movies under each section, just place each genre of movies on a page without the subcategories (e.g. new movies, classic). This way, more can fit on the screens and all of the options are available for everyone."

There Are A Lot Of shows Now! Last time I Was On This App I Could Barely Find a Movie That Was Suitable For Me! Now Netflix Has, Tv Shows,Movies Most Of Us Hasn’t Watched, And Many More!!! Although There Is A Slight Problem. It’s Only A Tiny Bug. You see, The Issue Is That No matter How Hard I Press On The Movie It Won’t Let Me Watch It. Either It’s Glitching Or Something Else. Another Thing Is The Screen Freezes And I Cant Fix It. Please Fix These Two Small Bugs And I’ll Be Happy As Ever! Thank You! 😱😱😱😄😄😄❤️😁😁"

The only thing I can do is limit it to what Netflix deems appropriate. Would it be so hard for them to let me block poor quality, violent and rude shows from showing up as options? There are so many good and educational shows that I want to let them watch! Please let me block shows!!
Furthermore while it hasn’t been a problem yet I can restrict a user to be only able to watch kid shows but there is no way to prevent my kids from just switching to an adult user. Please make a way to block switching users without a password."

But I just want to thank you for making this app keep up the good work.
2019-05-08 01:52:20,Netflix should add more shows and movies,5,.Valentinaa.,False,Netflix is a good app I mean I use it almost everyday and have finished a lot of the shows but I believe more people would want to watch it and pay for it if it had more shows and movies from new movie and shows to old ones because there are a lot of shows that I’m pretty sure a lot of people wish Netflix would add and movies too if they added more of those I believe more people would want to have Netflix and it’s a win win for us and then they get more money and we get more of our favorite shows and movies.
2019-02-26 05:31:07,Problems starting the app,2,chris909xx,False,"Lately I’ve been experiencing longer wait times at the moment of opening the app. Before it was instant, as soon as I’d tap the Netflix icon, all the movies and show would start to appear within five seconds or maybe even less. Now it gets stuck for a few minutes. It only seems like it keeps loading but the content takes way too long to come up. I can say this is very frustrating because no one really wants to wait to put the show they’re binge watching (at least in my case). It’s not a problem with my connecting, I’ve checked with different WiFi networks and it behaves the same. Not even with the most recent app update this problem has gotten fixed. It’s disappointing."

I love it! But please if Netflix Support sees this, what happened to fast-forwarding? There was an update a few weeks ago that let you double-tap to fast forward 10 seconds, but today my app updated and its back to the old, annoying way with only back tracking 10 seconds at a time. PLEASE GO BACK!!! I loved that feature, and also loved the pause button right in the middle. Is this a permanent update, or is my phone just glitching? Anyway, pLEASE HELP!!🤞🏻🤞🏻"

About a year or two ago Netflix got rid of Robin Hood. That was one of my favorites, but I rubbed it off. Then I found out a few months ago that Angelo Rules and Dear Dumb Diary was removed. Now that made me VERY ANGRY And UPSET!!! So it was bad enough until... that I recently found out that Netflix got rid of Minor Details! And all of those were on MY LIST! And no longer there and when I search it up it says it is no longer there and will give me other movies/shows similar. Well I don’t what that I want what I loved to only watch. It was pretty much what I only watch and now I am not really interested in anything else. So I hope that Netflix will bring back Robin Hood, Angelo Rules, Dear Dumb Diary, and Minor Details!!! PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE!!!!!"
2018-01-04 04:58:19,Long time Netflix subscriber,4,Fantoml,False,"Netflix is a huge part of my entertainment on our TV.  The app does what it should.  It streams movies.  I haven’t liked the newer format for a while now.  To easy to scroll too long.  Give me 5 or six movies in the categories I like then give me a “see more” button.  I want to fill the screen with movies I would like.
I enjoy Netflix on a multitude of streaming devices.  Mobile, roku, and Apple TV.  It is nice that the format is similar across all devices.  That said I LOVE the “up next” portion of the Apple TV.  I wish you would allow your app to share with the Apple TV so that my binge shows are a quick click and go!

Thanks!!"
2018-07-25 19:35:55,Gotten worse,2,Fire queen,False,I used to love Netflix and watch it all the time and I still do but I don’t like it as much. First of all I’d rather be able to rate it with stars and see other people’s thoughts to know whether it’s good or bad. I also really don’t like how instead of it telling u what it’s about it just says the category it falls into which i would rather know at least the storyline of it not just it’s a comedy or romantic. I just want it to go back to how it was without these new worse updates and stop taking off so many shows and movies that I love and are actually still really great and I would love to watch like baby daddy or shark boy and lava girl which is my childhood favorite and a bunch of Disney movies like star struck which I love and teen wolf which I really wanted to watch.
2018-06-10 23:05:49,Basically awesome,5,OUAT_CW,False,"Netflix is awesome I love to be able to watch a wide verity if shows and movies, no strings attached, for a decent price. My one complaint is that it can be hard to maneuver through and find what your looking for. Being able to download shows and movies had been a huge help though especially for long road trips. ( which I embark on frequently ) My one other complaint is that there isn’t a way to search in the “available for download” section. But other than that Netflix is a fantastic addition to my phone!!! Thank you Netflix!!"
2020-06-18 14:26:17,"Amazing, But It Needs More Movies",4,AvaClaireD,False,"This app is good, but I have read almost every movie and most of them aren’t that good. I think the creator should get more and BETTER movies in it, like humor, horror, kids, and adventure. Second of all, I think it should have more interactive shows and movies because they are SO FUN! Like, mostly more Captain Underpants because they are SO FUNNY AND ADVENTUROUS!
     Third of all and lastly, this app is missing a lot of types of movies and shows. I think that the creator should add a teenager section, an elderly section, and maybe even a PET section so they can watch their ancestors and be inspired. Over all, I LOVE IT, but there are some things to add.

Yes I still love Netflix and you should totally get it! Just when you take shows and movies off it’s kinda annoying and I wish that there was a way that (you might already have this but I don’t know about it) you could save movies and shows to where it doesn’t come off on your profile like adding them to favorites so they don’t get deleted or something?"

Every time I click to watch an episode, an error message comes up and tell me to come back later. When I do come back it says the same thing. This has been going on for a few days and I’m not sure why.i am able to watch all of my other shows except this one. I updated the app thinking that was the problem but it is still telling me there is a problem. Is this a recurring problem with other people or is it just me?"

2019-10-30 18:08:45,New Content?,4,Mal 😈,False,"I am a big fan of Netflix and I love it’s content but sometimes I get frustrated. I feel like the algorithm doesn’t give me new shows to watch. I get bored very easily and like to watch a lot of different things, shows and movies that I never heard of before but when I scroll through my feed on my iPhone it recommends stuff that I’ve already watched, am still watching, and is very similar to what I have seen. I think it would be really cool if there was a randomly generated suggestion tab that will introduce me to new and interesting content. If this feature was created I would probably never stop watching."
2019-01-25 12:35:21,Anime & Cartoon Titles,4,Kevin Waerd,False,"Pick up your anime game, man. Especially on Naruto. It’s episodes are not placed in their proper season and a lot of episodes don’t have Subtitles(Closed Captions). While we’re on the topic of Naruto, I would love to see the Shippuden series on Netflix. I already know the details about MHA(Crunchyroll’s contract) so I won’t talk about that. I’m guessing there’s also something dealing with contracts for the Dragon Ball series.

Relating to cartoons, American, not Japanese, is it possible to bring back titles like Young Justice and other Justice League movies. I’ve heard a lot of people being upset about Netflix replacing shows like the one I mentioned with Netflix originals. That’s all I have to say."
2019-07-22 16:32:52,AMAZING APP!,5,gmaergal81,False,"Netflix is a very good app, you get to watch movies and series of shows. And I liked when they did Netflix on the go, that means that you can download movies of series of shows on your phone at your house than when you go somewhere or like a long ride to vacation you can watch these movies or series of shows on the go. It’s a very amazing thing that they did. I’m always in the car and obv it gets super boring, but when I have my downloaded movies I can just watch them relaxingly. I definitely suggest this app for everyone. Have a great day and keep watching!!"
2018-12-29 04:00:40,What could be better,4,Ezyreveiws,False,"I don't usually write reviews but I felt as though this was a the thing to do to get  Netflix attention. I'm sure you've heard of the ideas of a comment section for Netflix I don't mind this idea I actually really like this idea. Another thing I wanted to bring up is the fact that the new update wear have to scroll up and down  for Netflix recommendation is not very convenient I think 💭 the better way of handling this is to scroll side to side . Other than that I love Netflix I actually count on it because I feel like it is more ""diverse"" on it better than HBO and Is more reliable than specific channels apps"

2020-10-11 02:13:28,Black teens of 2020,4,big daddy bam😩😋,False,You need too put in more black teen movies for an example charm city kings just more things that talk about BLM and diversity and more opportunities for young black teens like documentaries just things based on 2020 and you need too put back on all the old shows and all the old movies I think people would really tune in if you guys didn’t take off a whole lotta stuff like everything you guys put on was my childhood but y’all took it off now you guys have your own tv shows and movies we need actually funny things too watch and more realistic things and things that just talk about modern day things.💯
2018-06-25 04:15:15,Needs more popular movies,3,31kayla,False,"Ok so like I like Netflix and it works great and it has a lot of good movies, but where the hell are the movies at? Like here’s a tip Netflix lets not take off ‘Along Came Polly’ and put on ‘Samantha!’ instead which I’ve never even heard of. Put more marvel studios movies on there, the hunger games movies, x-men, ‘put easy a’ and ‘mean girls’ back on, also put the fault in our stars and paper towns too. I would also recommend the conjuring, Annabelle, Wonder Woman(gale gadot version), twilight movies, if I stay, John Tucker Must Die, get out. So yeah all these movies I’m naming have been in the theaters so stop putting ghetto movies that no one has heard of before. Like no one wants to watch ‘Adore’ or nick and Norah’s infinite playlist and ‘Heathers’."
2018-01-10 03:58:38,"Good service, app needs work ASAP.",2,C.dog.,False,"Netflix service overall is great. Big selection, fair price. 
The categories have always needed help (remove stand up specials from Comedy now that they have their own section; put a Movies filter on, or at least have a Movie category), but it’s still good on the whole. 
My beef is with this version of the app. After this last update, it won’t connect after the first time it’s used. On the second attempt, I’ll get a network error message (no issue with any other app or wireless connection). The only fix is to uninstall the app and redownload. It’s frustrating enough that I’ve cancelled my account and I’m using other apps for TV and movies until they fix it. 
Once this is fixed, I’ll happily be back."
2020-06-14 11:25:18,Make a teens section!! For parents benefits and teenagers,4,Awsomeest thing ever!,False,"Netflix should make a section for teenagers. Kids only has kiddy shoes older teenagers wouldn’t be interested in. They should put movies/series etc that are PG-13 and PG-14 and maybe non-rated in that section. PG-13 and PG-14 would be suitable for teenagers 13+, and it would be shows that aren’t for much smaller kids and would make us engaged. Adults has R and MA movies, which aren’t suitable for children. Kids is literally for babies and toddlers and any kid above 10 wouldn’t be interested. A teens section would be great for parents who are worried that their teenagers are seeing things they shouldn’t in the Adult netflix. Thank you!"
2020-06-25 23:25:17,The show everyone wants,5,Ysabel delisi,False,"Everyone has been obsessed with Avatar The Last Airbender since it was released onto Netflix, it has been bringing back childhood memories of when we used to watch it when we were kids. When I finished all three seasons I was sad because I wanted more, that is why I think Netflix should add The legends of Korra to Netflix and I have seen a lot of people who agree. Even know The legend of Korra hasn’t had the best feedback throughout the last couple of years so many people would enjoy watching it off of the best possible app that is Netflix"
2020-05-23 05:04:43,We have enough sections,5,Prettygoodguy154,False,"Great app. All those who are saying we need more sections appear silly. Of course there should be restrictions at some point - luckily we have that in the form of a kids section. 

The idea of preteen, teen, young adult, etc is illogical. If you are afraid of cussing, kissing etc., please register yourself as a child because that is the sort of content you will likely be viewing without these things. In addition, if you are not a child in real life you should be able to make the distinction between kid( or extremely sensitive person) content and adult (that which is not for kids) content, read the movie’s ratings and descriptions. Look up what content the movie contains. You, who are likely not a child, can do it. I believe in you. 

If you cannot make any of these distinctions don’t watch the shows or movies that you are afraid of. Luckily we have something to make that easier - the kids section.

2020-05-06 16:24:53,Minecraft,4,thesuperkiller,False,"So I personally think this Minecraft: Story Mode Series is great. But there’s a few things that need to fixed. In episode 4 you don’t have a choice to keep Lukas with the group or not, also in episode 4 you cant pick different armor. Otherwise the Series is great i wont complain about the lack of episodes because the main episodes are 1-4 the other 4 are is the adventure set. Anyway just add those things on episode 4 and the game is perfect otherwise.

Edit: The story has been great, but lately i have been checking for bugs and there is a bug when you choose to go to the next Episode the App crashes."
2020-05-22 03:08:20,Suggestion,5,Roxann_2601,False,"I absolutely love Netflix. I was reading a review about a suggestiin of locking a profile with a pin so no one can change or enter. I really like the idea so I decided to share it so it has a better chance of being seen.  
I too have a suggestion...
Netflix has a section where you can see shows or movies that can be coming soon. How about a “leaving soon section” where you can see shows or movies that will be moved from Netflix in a couple weeks. That way people can watch/ rewatch a show or movie before it is taken. I would love this."

I’ve be doing Netflix and it’s many series for a long time now... but THERE ARE BARELY ANY ANIMES ON THE KIDS. I would like to start watching anime but it’s not on Netflix kids. Trust me this is a amazing app to have and it has so many different things on it... but that brings me to another problem, the one that made it have only 4 stars... you need to add more content for the kids section and not just the cheesy Christmas stuff, can you please start adding more things like Wakfu, the gousts stuff, and other animated stuff. I don’t think you have enough things for kids."
2020-04-18 23:41:37,Why should resolution in a downloaded movie suffer?,3,WWXXYYZZ1234,False,"I recently downloaded a movie rather than watching it live because of all the extra Internet traffic due to the COVID-19 virus. So many of my neighbors are at home now, and everyone seems to be streaming this and that.

The movie downloaded fairly quickly, so I was able to get it during a time of day when the Internet wasn’t too busy. But later, when I watched it the resolution was terrible in many scenes. It was just like I would experience watching when the Internet is too busy, and the pictures became pixelated and very difficult to see. I simply don’t see why this should happen in a downloaded movie."
2019-03-21 03:19:08,Broadway Shows,4,Mera J.,False,"I’m not usually one to write reviews however I felt a need this time. I watched Newsies for the first time on Netflix and within a month or so you took it off. I was so frustrated when I wanted to watch it again but it was gone. Please add it back to the American shows. Also if there are other professionally recorded broadway shows, like Bandstand, please add them to Netflix as well. It will be a great way for those who don’t live in or near New York to watch them and then there’s people like me who watch them multiple times over. Bandstand and Newsies both were shown in movie theaters through Fathom Events by the way. Thank you."
2018-06-11 12:48:29,Disappointed,4,AD2298,False,"Netflix is like one of my favorite apps to watch shows and movies on. It was great! But there’s a problem on the app. When I would want to go watch a movie or show on my iPad, I would hit play. And then it says something like network error. It says there is a problem connecting to it. It works on my tv, but not on my device. I gave it 4 stars because it is a great app, and because that tiny bug that I know you can fix. It just make me disappointed that I can’t watch anything if that thing keeps showing up. Please fix it, and write back to me if you can. I love your app, it’s amazing, once again.😀"
2019-03-13 19:52:14,Perfecto,5,Cooper 2988,False,"Netflix is overall a great app, and I love how they include s many different genres and options for you to choose from. The only thing that I would want Netflix to add ares shows such as the Simpsons etc... After watching on Netflix for many years now, I’ve observed upon seeing that there are many great features to this app, and I would recommend it to anyone ranging from people who only like to watch just one show (Such as “The Office” for me) over and over again,  all the way to people who don’t really care or don’t know what their type of genera is yet."
2018-08-23 03:16:05,Stupidly limiting,3,ZVizzle,False,"This current user experience is limiting and frustrating. The main page shows your usual recommendations, which is to say the same 20 or so promoted titles, assuming you’re a real person who gravitates towards a few different genres. No longer can you browse by genre, aside from whatever the Netflix algorithm deems worthy to look at. There isn’t a real reason to have multiple sections when “popular on netflix,” “trending,” “recommended for you,” and “similar to _____” all contain roughly the same titles. It’s fine if you only want what is currently popular, or have a specific title in mind, but it’s stupid I can’t even do the work to find more under the radar options."

However, I attempted to bump some high-priority movies in my my-list to the top so I’d remember to watch them first, by removing and readding them to the my-list, and only after I was done did I realize that not all of them readded to the top of my list and I’d in fact deleted them! I can’t remember every one I removed. There is a bug apparently where sometimes you will tap the ‘add to my list’ button and it will change to ‘in my list’ when it hasn’t been added to your list! Frustrating glitch!"
2020-07-01 01:14:48,Removal of good movies,4,cris735,False,"Soo... how do I put this? Alright, so I wanted to watch Coraline for like the hundredth time after a while of not watching anything at all, and I could not find the movie at all. Not in the search, and not in my list, and I got pretty upset about that. I wonder... Is there really a good reason to go around removing movies or series from the app? I mean, some people have gotten their favorite movies removed, and I know I’m not the first and last to say this. Even if the app is great, there’s that, and let’s say “older” movies are quite harder to watch anywhere at all. I just hope that the admins won’t take more movies down."
2017-11-25 13:37:56,Bring back old features,3,dailyplanetintern,False,"A lot of “old” features that were to me essential have disappeared.

1. Star rating system. A thumbs dozen or up isn’t enough. I just don’t want to know if I liked it. I want to know how much I liked it. Was it super amazing or just ok? Also it helped knowing how much people liked it overall and in general. Those star rating were always very accurate,

2. Letting us know when a series or movie is leaving. How could you take that away? It’s super hard to find the list that shows what’s coming and going each month. It’s not readily available. It should be in the app but you’ve also taken away the warnings on the series/movies pages themselves. What’s worse than staring something new and in a week it’s gone? At least if I knew it was leaving I could either binge or not start it in the first place if I know I won’t have the time to finish.

3. What happened to the back/forward 10 second buttons? Those were super convenient! I HATE having to use the slider bar to rewind and fast forward. Why’d you take those down?!"
2017-10-04 17:00:11,Won't login since Oct 2017 Update,1,Mark326,False,"Aside from not allowing me to login since the last update was installed on my iPhone 6 Plus, what's with the reviews not being in absolutely ""any"" type of date order? The reviews are from dates all over the place. Not in date order and doesn't even offer opportunity of how you would like to sort the reviews as Itunes and the developers used to offer. This is important, as I always hold off on any updates for at least a week to see if there are any problems with the latest update installed, but now have to blindly install updates, which I may not be having this current inability to login problem if the reviews were reflected by latest date order. Thanks again Netflix for making a great app just another problematic app!"

The apps the price constantly goes up each year. They either add other features or channels - and with out you realizing it your cost per month has gone up . Or the video can’t load or there’s a error check back. Or you have the app paying for it now if you want to watch another session or a certain movie - yep you pay extra.

I’m about ready to end my subscription with Nexflix as I’m sure a lot of people are too because of how bad all the shows are. I’ve also noticed that Netflix removed all of the big lgbtq+ hits/ the ones with a small same sex romance. Hmm why is that Netflix??? So you guys are homophobic now huh? Maybe bring back “I’m Not Okay With This” and “The Society” and me and all the other fans we’ll talk but till then you’re homophobic to me:)"
2020-08-04 04:48:43,A little disappointed with recent changes,3,Bulldogloverch,False,"I feel like if you have had a movie in your system that people can watch then it should stay there. 4 of my favorite movies (dark crystal, sweeney Todd, Charlie and the chocolate factory, and below her mouth) have recently been removed and it sucked when I went to go watch them (like I usually do) and they weren’t there....  I also feel there should be a wider selection of Tim Burton movies, but my main concern and reason for giving three stars is due to the changes and removal of movies without warning.

-reading some of the recent reviews I see that many people are also having an issue with the removal of movies and shows."
2020-06-26 16:21:39,Suggestion to Viewing algorithm,4,Dashiepredetor,False,"I’ve been using Netflix for years and it’s great, but the only suggestion I have is for Netflix’s recommend algorithm. I usually have watched most of the things recommended or i have trouble searching for something to watch but I think if a “random pick” feature is implemented that is based off the algorithm will greatly help those who can’t decide what to watch next. I know I have lots of things in my list but can’t choose so I end up not watching anything for days and this feature will help me pick a movie/show much faster, if not at least a “re-roll” ."
2020-06-16 15:55:38,Don’t Get During Covid,3,CometHofferson,False,"If you are looking to get Netflix right now, I advise you to wait until Covid has mostly blown over. I have had Netflix for a very long time now and have been very satisfied. Of course when we are streaming on the television, it sometimes would load but it was easily fixed by going out and coming back in. Now, and this started when Covid did, it gets stuck every time without fail. Sometimes it gets stuck on 20% but most of the time it gets stuck on 24%. It works fine on our other devices but we have found streaming Netflix on our television completely useless. I am hoping that it will get better when Covid settles down."
2019-06-19 05:10:01,I like it and all but there are several things bothering me,3, it crashes all the time,False,"For example, you seriously need to consider parents who are using this App, for example I’d switch to children’s mode, but inappropriate posters of adult rated movies still show up on the screen! Imagine coming back from work after your kids finished watching Max and Ruby and there is a poster of two naked men spooning in bed 🤦🏻‍♀️ I suggest that you guys should have a parental guidance or security option where a parent could hide a show, or lock up the whole adult content.. It’s annoying and frustrating 😫 please do something about this.. If it were a free app, I wouldn’t complain, but parents are paying customers as well!"
2020-03-20 04:39:10,I love Netflix !,5,cuco :).,False,I love Netflix a lot but it has it’s downfalls. When I try anime they don’t always have all the season. For example Haikyuu originally has 4 seasons yet they only put 2 seasons on there. Same as HunterXHunter they only put 2 season on there. I want to have the full anime experience and watch the full anime instead of some. Can you please start putting all of the season on there. I really do enjoy watching anime. As long as the other animes people love watching. Y’all can put all the season on the other tv shows yet y’all can’t do it for anime. Thank you for your time. :).
2019-04-10 12:10:28,This is a great app,5,Jaiden H.,False,"This is a fantastic app to watch movies and tv shoes. Here is something that would make it even better. So for some movies (not all) there are alternate endings, for example I Am Legend has an alternate ending. It would be great if you could add a setting in the information area where you can watch the alternate ending. Also if you can could you do something so if someone adds a movie to their list than the movie won’t leave their list even if you take it off of Netflix? That would also be fantastic. If you take my advice, thank you so much."
2018-09-04 13:18:37,Formatting/ screen size ratios,4,big F little u,False,For the love of god please format all movies and tv shows to fill the entire screen. Nobody wants to lose the top and bottom of their screen. When you watch stuff on an iPad you can either lose an inch at the top and bottom of the screen or you can go to full screen and lose much of the sides. Like in a documentary using full screen you miss the names of people because they are cut off on the sides. I want to see everything and have my entire screen utilized too. It’s almost 2019 and having two black lines on your screen is so 1990’s. But it’s “wide screen!” Nobody cares! Please fix it!
2019-03-18 11:27:42,Will not play downloaded files - support worthless,1,Jane7344,False,"I did the free trail to test out Netflix.
I successfully downloaded the two seasons of shows available of a tv show to watch later without internet access.  
The first two times I could play the downloaded videos.
The next time I started the ap I got a blank screen with a spinning symbol and the upper right had the word signin.

With the ap still open, when I drive to a location with internet access the ap now showed the normal screen and I could view a video.

When I didn’t have internet access only about 1/3 or 1/2 the time would the normal screen come up and I could play videos.  The rest of time I could do nothing until I had internet access.

Totally worthless.  

And support, after 30 minutes talking to several people could not even understand the issue (asking stupid questions like which video would not play - after I said I started the ap and only saw a spinning screen with signin in the upper right corner and telling me netflix will not play downloaded files without being connected to the internet after I said sometimes it worked and sometimes it didn’t).

I canceling my trial."
2018-11-09 21:12:51,This was a great idea and app a long time ago,1,RJtucson,False,"This was a great idea and app a long time ago. It seems pretty useless now. They’ve removed ratings. They don’t let you search in any reasonable way unless you’re on a desktop. Now all the new movies are busy and won’t load. They don’t have enough copied licensed. Odd because they made some of the movies. I guess they don’t think their own movies are good enough to show. Mostly, just agree. You can watch what you want other places. It seems like the whole Netflix app is designed to promote a few second rate movies they cranked out. No thanks. Update: when I tried to cancel they said “something must have happened” they kept charging my card for months. I’m done with this. Netflix is a criminal organization in my mind. And they aren’t even good at it."
2018-09-15 00:58:30,Why can’t you move titles between profiles?,3,bpgh8,False,"“My List” has always been the worst part of the Netflix app. Of all the great steps forward Netflix has made, My List is way to easy to get out of control. To manage things a little better, and because there’s no rhyme or reason sometimes to how they organize the list, I make profiles based on themes I like: Comedy, Documentaries, Action.... There should be a way to move titles between them. I’ll see a recommendation, save it, but it’s on the wrong profile. Now I need to log out, into the other, add it there, and remove on the 1st profile — too many steps for a logical option that should have been available years ago."
2020-05-02 12:16:27,Teen section,4,Unicorn_1708,False,"I know I’m not the first to say this. PLEASE ADD A TEEN CHOICE!!!
All of the teen shows are on the adult choice ,but there’s still Tv-MA stuff and rated R movies on it, and some parents don’t want their kids to see that stuff! And the kids section should be called “little kids” section. Like, shows like “Alexa and Katie” (which I love) shouldn’t be at the same age choice as freaking “Baby Bum”. There should be a kids section, preteen section, teen section AND adult section. Or at least a teen section with shows that aren’t for little kids!!! PLEASE! I’ve been using Netflix forever and this has annoyed me for that time. Please even consider this,

2018-06-04 14:22:41,There are improvements to be made,3,why cant i read it,False,"As much as I like this app, several things stand out to me as needing improvement. Firstly, we need a skip forward button. It doesn’t make sense to only be able to rewind something with a button press. I’m tired of having to scroll through the time bar to do this.
 Secondly, we need a better review system. Just a thumbs up or thumbs down isn’t specific enough. 
Thirdly, why can’t we browse the genres like we used to be able to. We used to be able to select a genre, sci fi mystery for example, and go through a list of every title on Netflix that was labeled such. Now all we get is s what Netflix decides are the top titles of those genres."
2018-02-05 04:50:27,Please help me,3,One love unicorns,False,"I love Netflix don’t get me wrong. However I’ve watched season one of Riverdale when it came out on Netflix and have been waiting for season two as I do not wish to watch it on television. People have been saying that episodes of it have already come out but when I check it the episodes aren’t there. I tried to see if I needed an update for it, if it is just a problem with my phone and it is on another device, uninstalling the app, and even looking on the internet if someone has this problem as well but nothing has worked. I do not know who else to contact except for Netflix. Please help me solve this issue and thank you so much for reading this."
2019-08-23 03:49:10,Good Overall,4,TalisRaye,False,"The app works pretty fast and stable except for rare buffering issues, but that’s everything. Fairly cheap for all you can get. Support is usually pretty cool.

There are 2 bones of contention.
1. Netflix seems far more interested lately in “Netflix Originals” and, let’s face it, they’re not all “Black Mirror” so maybe go back to uploading other stuff. Which brings us to...
2. Kindly stop having only a few seasons of something. If you’re going to have it, have all of it. If you can’t or won’t have all of it, get rid of the part of it. I hate getting into new shows only to find out a season is missing."
2017-09-19 01:25:15,Good but....,4,dr.wizardman13,False,This app is good but there is something wrong with it it won't let me download anything I pay for this  to work and it's not doing a good job if it's not gonna doe it's job and still pay you for awful services then this app isn't a very good app for it to pay you there is a Hurricane coming tomorrow and I want to download my things before I I don't have internet connection I expect an upgrade within the next 2 hours if I don't get it by then I will stop paying you will see what's going to happen next it's a great app  but it doesn't work as well as it should do I expect my upgrade within 2hours don't forget thx
2019-04-30 22:34:53,VPN Blocks Ruin Netflix,2,Austin Layland,False,"Let me set something straight. I love Netflix itself. It has a huge variety of shows. A little lax on child protection but that’s not the reason for my bad review. It is because of Netflix blocking all users using VPNs. Due to many international copyright laws, citizens of other countries have a separate Netflix from US Residents. And many shows are blocked on their Netflix resulting in people illegally using VPNs to access the US Netflix selection. And people like me use VPNs for legal uses, like security or work cannot access Netflix. So many innocents are casualties of this war on illegal VPN users. So Netflix, are you going to continue to fight a battle that Will eventually lead to you losing customers, or are you lift the VPN ban. I will change my review when you do."
2018-11-07 04:14:45,Shows not keeping up with episodes I watch,3,LetMeChooseADamnNickname,False,"For probably two or three months, when I watch episodes of shows on Netflix, the continue watching does not update so if I click a show from continue watching it will take me back to episodes which I’ve already watched. Quite often when I click details to select an episode, the episodes will not be updated although this is not always the case. This problem occurs on my iPad, MacBook, and smart tv. This problem is quite obnoxious because the continue watching feature is useful. Otherwise there are few problems, but I hope this glitch will be addressed promptly."
2018-06-13 17:43:49,Issues tho,5,he nah,False,"I love Netflix. I download shows to watch on the train but lately, its been giving me an issue. Its been saying ""failure to connect"" every time I use it. I'm at home with wifi, out the house w/ data, on the plane w/ wifi, etc. when I use to be on the train, I was still able to use Netflix. Now I can't. I been having this issue since friday. What do I do? I've gone on airplane mode to restart everything, disconnect from the wifi and even after resetting my phone. 

Btw: I just updated the app today, and its still giving me the same issues."
2018-04-03 23:19:23,STILL NO BACKGROUND STREAMING,2,RedRoseAlways,False,"I deleted this app several weeks ago because I was frustrated that you can’t stream what you’re watching in the background. With Comcast Xfinity I can listen to what I’m watching while I’m doing other things on my phone so I am not a slave to the app. Netflix is not that handy. As soon as you leave the Netflix app to answer a text or to do something else, the sound/show just stops. You can’t just continue what you’re watching while you live your life. You have to be devoting 100% of your time to what you’re watching. You can’t try to multitask are actually have a life. So yet again, I am deleting Netflix. Canceling my subscription again. So pointless. Such a simple fix, but they’re too lazy to do it."
2018-02-02 04:06:38,Best video steaming service!,5,Mhunt ,False,"Hand down the best video streaming service. A very large library of great exclusive Netflix exclusives like Punisher, Stranger Things, Godless, etc. They even some amazing exclusive movies. Large selection of regular TV shows and movies. Streaming quality is amazing and looks great even with slow internet. Has HDR/Dolby Vision support for supported devices while most streaming services don’t. Movies and shows look amazing in HDR something to see in person on an iPhone X. Fast loading times when loading video. Finally great customer service! Highly recommend!"
2017-10-27 13:53:33,Pause features,3,Group on junkie,False,Normally I would give this app 5 stars but it seems like there is a new Netflix update daily and they really are not fixing issues. In order for the app to work the way I prefer on my phone I have to delete the app and then redownload it. The app will not allow me to pause my shows for longer than two minutes. If two minutes and I mean literally two minutes goes by without me pressing play the app will shut completely out and my phone will open to up to the home screen. This is the most frustrating thing I have had to deal with. I need to be able to pause my shows for however long I am a mother
2017-10-07 00:42:33,Crashes.,3,ItzShortie,False,"I would give Netflix 5 stars (because I really love it when it works) but ever since the most recent update, I find myself completely unable to watch it on my iPhone 7. The app opens up fine, I can log into it fine, and I can even browse without a problem. HOWEVER, every single time I click “play” on ANY title, the app immediately crashes. I have closed it and reopened it, logged out and logged back in, deleted it and redownloaded it, turned off my device and turned it back on, but NOTHING works. No matter what, the app crashes as soon as I click play. It has not worked correctly a single time since the new update. Please fix this."
2020-02-25 04:37:32,What about Anime?,4,Liv@blushing,False,Netflix is amazing don’t get me wrong but when it comes to updating Anime it’s not the best....There are so many good anime shows that I would love to watch and I can- its just that it doesn’t always have all of the seasons. Let’s take Fairytail for instance it has a total of 8 seasons but only 1 is available on Netflix. And it’s not just this show either Haikyu has 4 seasons but only 2 are available and so on and so on I could seriously make a list. I’m not bashing on The Netflix team because they are working their butts off as well but the Anime genre has some room for improvement regarding the installments of seasons
2020-10-13 03:46:03,Netflix please READ!!!,3,Ashimin,False,"Hey, the only complaint I have is the “play next episode” option won’t automatically work unless you are on WiFi. I can understand that you guys may have done this to prevent someone from using up all of their cellular data in case they fall asleep or something, but why can’t we just have the option to turn it on/off while on cellular data? I ditched my WiFi and have unlimited cellular data and I’m super annoyed that next episodes won’t automatically play for me. Lots of times I am cleaning up or watching while I do something else and I have to drop what I’m doing to press the “next episode” button. I hate it!!! Please fix this!!!!!"
2020-09-29 22:08:18,Amazing app - a few details needed to discuss,5,official.fancy,False,"So for starters, this app is amazing! I use it everyday and it’s pretty easy to understand and use. Recently I’ve been having issues with downloads, I download an episode to watch offline and then once I’m offline and have no WiFi I go to play the episode and it says theirs an error. I’ve updated the app, re-downloaded episodes, and even deleted and re downloaded the app. Nothing seems to work and I can’t watch anything offline. 

That’s been my only issue so far! I hope you can fix it soon."
2019-06-20 04:51:48,Please Fix “My List” (Manual Setting),3,Hoopsrule,False,"For the past few months, save for a couple weeks, each new title added to “My List” (manual setting) has gone to the very bottom of “My List” instead of the top. 

Not sure why no one has caught this. I’m assuming most have their “My List” on the default Netflix Suggests setting (because setting can only be changed on website, not in app).  But for those like me utilizing Manual Setting, it’s not really useable if I have to scroll to the bottom each time to find my most recent added titles. 

Please make app developer/updates team aware of this. Each new update I anticipate it being fixed, yet it still hasn’t been."
2019-02-23 04:08:27,Fix this !!!,4,vane9868,False,"For the most part I have no problem with the app although, there is one thing that just irritates me I look through the movies I choose one that I want to watch and I can’t watch it, because it is not available to watch where I am. I would prefer the app to only show movies that I can watch instead of having to be disappointed because I can’t watch the move that I clicked on. Over all I think that the app is great don’t get me wrong, but I just don’t find it to be practical having to find a movie that I like, but having to make sure I can watch it where I am currently at."
2019-04-28 18:21:35,I LOVE NETFLIX SO MUCH,5,ava s. maat,False,"i love netflix and binge watch shows fast and incredibly easy. there is nothing wrong with netflix in my opinion... besides the fact that none of the old amazing disney shows are on it, along with cartoons i used to watch as a kid. sometimes i just want a throwback and wish that i could watch shows like tom & jerry, suite life in deck, drake & josh, austin & ally, scooby doo, and so many more. i also wish game of thrones was on netflix. i understand some of these are impossible to get but i would love netflix so much more if these shows were added! i love this app so much! thanks"
2018-12-05 14:53:11,Not all good,4,Jo4ia,False,"Netflix has usually made good changes with their updates, but some of the most recent one isn’t!  While watching a TV show, you will get to the end of the episode.  I’m used to reaching to the upper left corner to exit the show. Now, however, one must go searching for the exit button. Why can’t you keep things generally in the same position with each app change? It’s annoying and very frustrating and time consuming to the viewer. Remember, we PAY for the Netflix service. It’s not like it’s a free app or air TV.  Just keep this in consideration for future “improvements“ you make.  Thanks."
2018-07-14 00:05:27,please see and add this netflix !,4,THIS IS THE BEST GAJE,False,"first of all netflix is a great great app for watching movies and tv shows they provide but they don’t have as much good movie selections or show selections no more since they deleted most of it. They have old movies nobody really sees and put some really good shows they have on netflix originals, i think you should add other shows back on netflix like family guy and others that are related to that show also you should add some spongebob and old disney shows or even keeping up with the kardashians,  i’ve been wanting to see thoses shows please add these tv shows on netflix soon !!!!!!!!!"
2018-11-09 21:01:45,Terrible... just Terrible,2,TrickyRicky445,False,"Netflix used to be good, it had great classics, military action packed movies, and etc. but they removed my favorite military movie yet, the only good military/comedy on Netflix which is “Full Metal Jacket”, now all they have is terrible military “movies” with terrible acting. How am I supposed to be entertained? Netflix is supposed to be entertainment for the people, not pathetic rip off movies with bad acting. Netflix I hate to admit it but your going down hill, please add good movies like Dunkirk, or something military related that’s good, I mean these veterans do deserve more respect, they are the reason why we are here safe in America. All I have to say is please bring back the entertainment we want, the stuff that will entertain us, and please bring back Full Metal Jacket. Thank you"
2018-10-28 12:40:23,KingMatt79,5,KingMatt79,False,"Netflix is... one notch below air conditioning as historically one of the best things ever invented by a human.  Well maybe automobiles cause we’d have to walk or ride horses without those. Hmmmm.... well it’s definitely up there! Netflix on a cold rainy Sunday all nuggled up with the wife is my idea of a vacation. Binge out on some awesome docu or pick one of their hundred original series that you can’t go wrong with most any of them.

BUT and that is a bigger and bigger but with updates... why do you continue to shrink amount of time I can download and watch shows.  I usually try to keep about 3 hours of shows ready to watch in case end up stuck somewhere. But now it’s down to days max to watch and then there is limit in times you can download? Wth!?  It was bad enough to have it restricted to 2 weeks cause sometimes things come up to where I can’t watch.  But now I downloaded stuff this morning to see expires in 4 days? Come on.  It’s not costing you any different to let me watch it in next 4 days or next 2 weeks."
2018-07-27 18:59:57,Prevents WiFi working with other apps after search,1,JacKnife1066,False,"I was adding titles to my watchlist from a review article, which means I was using the iPad Pro’s native web browser and the app. I did a search, clicked on the icon in the search results, added it to my list, closed the movie page (which takes you back to the search results page), then clicked on another movie. That movie page was blank, as it turned out to be for every one I tried.

I gave up after many tries, and went to do other stuff, but nothing else that used WiFi worked. I spent more than an hour doing everything I could think of, including shutting down my tablet many times snd rebooting the modem. When I did get things to work, it was temporary. Until I removed the Netflix app, that is. Then everything worked fine.

I tried going through the website, but doesn’t allow me to add to my watchlist or to watch anything. It seems that no matter what I want to do (except manage account details), they just throw up a “Get App” screen which I can’t close.

It is just too much hassle, and I am ready to pitch Netflix, which makes searching insanely difficult through the tv."

Netflix please don't do this to me. I don't know what I'll do without it. My friends and I all love this show so much and share many fun stories and experiences we've had just enjoying this show. I don't care how old I am, i am genuinely upset about this. I couldn't find the email so this is the next best thing. I love you Netflix but I am in extreme distress."
2020-02-24 23:14:57,Cool but update it more,4,DaPoopyhead,False,"I’ve been using Netflix and it’s cool most of the time. It has good movies, tv shows, documentaries, etc. While all of that is good, the updates are really going downhill. I’ve been noticing that you guys rarely update tv shows, movies and documentaries and I find it really irritating. There are some seasons and movies I’ve been waiting to get uploaded, but it’s been almost 6 months since you guys made new seasons/movies on the app, like popular tv shows that don’t get any new seasons from you guys. For example, an anime called “The Disastrous Life of Saiki K. or “Agents of S.H.E.I.L.D”. Your app is amazing but please update it more, have a nice day."
2018-02-16 01:54:33,Great app but:,5,😡Disappointeduser😡,False,"I love this app and use it almost everyday, but I wish you’d put the option where you can double tap right to skip forward and left to go backwards during a show back on the app. I really liked using that option. Also when you had the pause button in the middle of the screen instead of the bottom left, that was great and really helpful.

 Overall this app is great and very organized and Id love to see the things I mentioned above included in the app, it would definitely make it even better."
2020-08-06 02:12:52,It’s great and all but...,3,the evergoblin,False,"Listen—it’s a great app & great service. The interface is nice and easy to use, quality is good, all that stuff. I genuinely recommend it.

But recently, most of my favorite titles have been removed, with no titles I have interest in watching left. Because of this, I’ve been sticking to Disney+ entirely, because it’s got some of my favorite movies that I can rewatch again and again without fear of their removal.
I get it, you remove the titles you can’t keep anymore because of the lack of views, but seriously. I discovered some of my favorite movies on here, and finding out they were removed after going back to rewatch them is always a huge bummer :/"

As a Netflix fan since this pandemic I am proud to say that I have a popular suggestion that I think that should be added to Netflix and will help during this pandemic. As you know the #1 animation seller “Rebecca Sugar’s: Steven Universe”, An UNBELIEVABLE amount of Companies wanted to work with Rebecca’s work since then. Now she came out with “Rebecca Sugar’s: Steven Universe Future THE MOVIE”, An UNFORGETTABLE and Popular Movie in 2019! I HOPE THIS POPULAR OPINION GETS THROUGH, I HIGHLY ENJOY REBECCA’S WORK AND OTHER PEOPLE DO TOO."
2019-07-30 04:41:48,Netflix,4,anime3736483,False,I Love Netflix but the reason why I gave it a 4 out of 5 is because I am a huge anime person but the facts that you don’t have all of Fairy tail episode makes me quite disappointed also the fact that you don’t have my hero academia just makes me even more disappointed but other than that I LOVE Netflix so please if it isn’t to much to bother can you pleaseeee put all of the fairy tail episode and my hero academia episode thank you also for anyone who’s reading this Netflix honestly is amazing it’s totally worth the money but if your an anime person like me you’ll also love it ifc not all animes are complete but maybe one day
2020-01-21 20:50:42,Netflix Chill,5,Super Soph🥳,False,"I love Netflix. It’s so easy to stream all my favorite TV shows and movies. The app is easy to use and has a simple layout. I love how they are constantly adding new content. But lately, I’ve been bummed because F.R.I.E.N.D.S was taken off! I know it’s not your fault that another company beat you to the rights to the show, but could you please try to bring it back? It was the second most streamed show in 2018. I also love that when you finish an episode you go right into the next one without having to press any buttons. Overall it’s an incredible app.😍😍😍"
2019-11-24 22:38:18,"Poor quality, broken functionality",2,joshfields.tbone,False,"The quality of downloads and streaming isn’t great, compared to other services. I don’t have internet at home (too rural), so I download at work. It looks marginally okay on the iPad Pro, but garbage on the TV. 

Also it offers the option to “renew” your download if you don’t watch it in 30 days, which makes sense so you don’t cancel your subscription after downloading six months worth of videos... but that functionality has NEVER WORKED. I’m talking well over a year. It gives an error message every time, so you have to delete the download, and waste bandwidth downloading from scratch. This not being fixed clearly shows an ineptitude on the part of the developers."
2018-12-15 15:04:32,Nowhere else to complain....,1,deniseruttan,False,"I was a loyal Netflix user for almost a decade until yesterday. Someone used one of my email addresses to sign up for an account, then changed the email and info. When I called to report this possibly fraudulent activity and (lost account access, because I forgot I’d used a different email address), their response was that there was nothing they could do, record of me did not exist and would I like to sign up for a new account? Because they couldn’t offer me any remedy and their customer service was nonexistent, and there is no one even to forward these strange emails to, I canceled my account due to that phone interaction and I’ve changed all my info. Get better customer service and care more about your customers’ information security, Netflix."
2018-07-31 04:47:31,Please reimplement fast forward and back,4,RachS79,False,"Overall I have little negative to say about the Netflix app. It does what I need it to. Last month, I started watching a show that I greatly enjoy but don’t want the blood and gore/sexual sense, so I was thrilled to be able to just tap the fast forward 10 seconds button on the screen. In addition if I missed something and wanted to watch it again the fast back 10 seconds was equally appreciated. The slider is pointless as I can never easily move the time forward or back with accuracy.  I do hope they put this feature back in the app."
2018-11-10 00:37:42,Absolutely amazing but... (MUST READ),5,Swag vn,False,The thing Is Netflix is amazing and such a good place to watch movies and shows but... Some shows are missing episodes and seasons even some movies. Tbh some shows like Naruto are amazing but they are missing episodes and all the Naruto movies (I’m not obsesssed with Naruto I’m using it as an example.) Please Netflix I don’t want to watch episodes over and over again put more episodes of theses kinds of shows and maybe add movies related to the shows like Naruto Shippuden is a movie continuing Naruto story. I hope you read this and thank you.
2018-09-18 07:36:36,This update,1,Waxpixel,False,"Latest update has casting issues (assuming it has to do with ads, which you can turn off through settings on desktop). Casts fine for 1 movie/episode but when auto-playing to next episode casting would come with playback errors. Have to reopen app>close>restart>disconnect/reconnect>recast. So far happens every time w/o fail.  Must be because I turned off the ads option as reading from the reviews they’re more frequent than when they first started it. If Netflix needs more revenue, they perhaps should stop licensing crap jargon that can be found online anyways and control their budgeting. Although I’m sure they sell our browsing habits which is probably why they continue to have a cluster mess of genres; like their unintuitive layout to force us to browse."
2017-11-24 14:25:25,Download section,4,Halforr,False,"I do really like this app. And I use it all the time. I do have one suggestion though. And it’s for the download section on the app. I don’t fly too often, but when I do I like to have something to watch and I don’t normally purchase the WiFi that the airlines offer. Well, I can’t access my downloaded shows and movies when my phone is in airplane mode. I get that I could open the app and start the show or movie before I put my phone in airplane mode. But I’m never going to remember to do that! I think it would be awesome if we could somehow access our downloads while in airplane mode."
2018-03-09 03:21:51,"English, Spanish",3,vamdamn,False,"OK first of all I want to say that Netflix is really cool because I can watch a movie anytime anywhere that I have service and they all have some pretty good movies. Now here comes the bad I see a bunch of scary movies that I would like to see but they’re in a different language than English, I wish that Netflix for specify which movies are In what language the movies going to be in because I hate seeing a movie that I want to see and its in a different language. But I don’t know it’s in a different language because it doesn’t specify. So please Netflix the next update specified what movies and what language thank you. That is why am giving Netflix three stars"
2017-12-02 05:28:11,Auto play: BAD after a movie!!!,3,R&BQueen26,False,"So I have an Apple TV and my Netflix just started doing this thing where I can’t see the end credits of a good movie because it’s too busy suggesting the next movie, playing the trailer. 

And that would be fine, if the auto play suggestions were any good, but they’re not. It suggested some anime series and I hate anime (it’s just incredibly overrated and it’s doubly annoying when you’re surprised with something you can’t stand while trying to finish a film you actually enjoyed. 

Please just go back to showing the suggested titles as suggested still images at the bottom and stop auto playing the trailers of things I’d never watch. Thanks."
2020-10-12 21:17:54,Just one thing...,4,Foxmoon9❤️,False,"I love Netflix!! I don’t have the phone app, but I do have the tv app. So, I have just one tiny request. I can’t find Avatar: The Legend Of Korra. At least, on my kids account. It aired on Nickelodeon. It’s TV-Y7. I SHOULD BE ABLE TO WATCH THIS. Btw, I’m on Canadian Netflix. I don't like this. You can easily find Avatar: The Last Airbender and a certain trash movie about a kid from a civilization that was lost a century ago that I WILL NOT SPEAK OF, and Netflix is making a live-action Avatar: The Last Airbender series, and yet no Legend Of Korra. I’m not sure if you’re aware that this is a thing, but it is, and I’m going to die of loneliness if I don’t get to see LoK.

~Signed, an ATLA fan."
2020-06-10 04:53:48,Pretty good,4,Lyndon. j🥰,False,I love Netflix to be honest but the thing is for many of the shows I wanna watch like Hunter x Hunter Netflix is the only place that I can use that has it as English dub instead of sub and that’s why I love it but the other thing is that Hunter x Hunter is not updated it has 2 other seasons that came out a while ago that I really wanna watch but I can’t because everywhere else it’s subbed and on Netflix it’s not there so my one thing that I think Netflix needs to get better at is updating shows with seasons already out in the world especially during quarantine. But overall thanks for saving me from boredom.
2020-10-11 20:51:10,ComedyShortsGamer,5,ComedyShortsGriffin,False,This is a good app for all ages but I find one problem Netflix used to have thousands of good movies and shows that go on and on and you never got bored you never got tired of watching the same thing Netflix actually needs to release every movie and show that exists I’d be one of the best apps other than Disney+ they need to do that especially during with this virus people can’t go anywhere they can’t see their family I just feel like doing this will be a world changer and I’d be so happy if that happens- ComedyShortsGamer
2020-06-06 16:35:20,I love it but there’s a few stuff I don’t like,4,frusterated girl,False,"I like Netflix and watch it A LOT. But whenever I watch it on my iPad I have to keep deleting/downloading every time I use it after I watch it on my phone when I let my phone charge. Also there should be a teen section for like 11 year olds to like 15 year olds. The last thing is that there should be a comment or rating section, so I know of I should watch the show or not, or if it’s a show I would like or not. Like i watched ‘Go, Live Your Way’ and the ‘ A Lister’ ( I’m not sure of the name but it’s similar, and I thought I would enjoy it but it’s wasn’t a show for me."
2018-11-25 18:03:44,Good app but iPhone XS Max not utilized,4,Agparham,False,"I’ve always enjoyed this app, seems to work pretty smoothly and has a lot of content.  However, with my galaxy s8+ the full infinity screen was utilized which was really nice. But just recently upgraded to iPhone XS Max and was disappointed to find out that the viewing screen is same size as the iPhone Plus series, it does not use the full screen available on the Max. I don’t see an option to stretch the screen in settings so appears to be an app thing.  Also wish there was a way to rate a series or movie and see the overall rating score.  Otherwise it’s pretty good."
2020-05-11 18:05:55,Needs some fixes,3,William82891,False,"I am CONSTANTLY adding things to my list just to find out the app for some reason unadded it, this happens no matter which device I use. It’s really frustrating because I can’t remember EVERYTHING I see or want to watch so when I go back but can’t find it i tend to assume it’s been taken off the site but really it was never added to my list please fix this it has been a problem for a really long time and I have heard other users complain about it. It would also be cool if you could add an “leaving soon” category so we could have a last chance to watch content that we didn’t know was being taken off this month."
2020-05-03 21:45:29,Just Stream It Already!,3,MyOpinion for JustInMyOpinion,False,"So it's really annoying when you get really drawn in to an amazing show and then Netflix cancels it. Why? Because there is controversy because it offends someone. First of all... It's fiction writing. Second of all.... If you don't like it, don't watch it!! But why ruin it for everyone else!!?? If the writers don't know what else to write, that's one thing. But a streaming platform should just Stream and stay out of the politics. Yes, I'm talking about Messiah. Just read several articles saying you guys cancelled it due to controversy... Please tell me this is not true. I want a streaming platform that is neutral, that I can count on to provide shows from every type of genre."
2019-12-23 22:58:07,Five Stars But Like For Real I'm Going Crazy!!,5,Rebekah St.,False,"I need help!! I've been sitting around for the last hour and a half trying to pay my bill for Netflix so I can watch my movies and stuff and it's not working!😩 It's driving me crazy!! My Netflix payment is billed through the iTunes Store and I can sit for 15 minutes and it'll still be loading on the screen and won't pop up my billing information, and it's making me mad! If someone reads this and knows what's going on then please help me, because I'm going crazy not being able to use Netflix!!!"
2019-10-30 23:04:28,Love it but,5,Luthiel92,False,I enjoy having Netflix especially since I’m pregnant and laying down helps my nausea. But one thing I ABSOLUTELY HATE is the horror movie selection on here. There is some good ones but that’s few and far in between. The others are all in other languages that I’ve tried watching them but watching it and stopping it to read what is being said makes a movie take way to long and I’m way to annoyed to do that to every. Single. Movie. why can’t you not only put better horror movies on your thing and some in English too??? Just a thought :/
2019-06-28 18:36:05,Yeah it’s good but it has its faults,5,Dangofamily,False,"So even though I gave it a five star rating it’s not perfect, I only did that because the pros outweigh the cons. But it would be even better if they would numb the price back down, and have more of a selection of tv shows. Don’t get me wrong it has some good ones but not enough variety to many old shows and not enough of the new ones. And no offense but most of the Netflix originals are really dark and disturbing, I’m not really into that all that much. If they would fix this it would be a better experience."
2019-03-31 03:38:49,Add new shows,5,devilbatt,False,"Dear Netflix workers, 
            Please add the show Sam and Cat I watched it in Canada and it was great and I think that other kids will like it to. Another show I would like you to add is Bella and the Bulldogs because it shows girls that you can do anything because it about a girl named Bella who becomes the quarter back for her high school team. Another reason you should add these shows is because a lot of people say that Canadian tv is better and do we really want that? I think not so that is why you should add these amazing shows!

                            P.S please add these shows!"
2017-12-09 00:37:12,Amazing  app,4,JRLOGO14,False,"I absolutely love this app I really do. Just the download feature alone plays a big part of my life since my work doesn’t offer WiFi to workers anymore. Only thing I wish it would do that would help me and I’m sure other people is if before I click or open up and movie, series, ext. I love LOVE to who where y’all put the info on the subject at hand of the speaking language is in that brief follow up also. Plus I would like to have the option to move the which ever content of my con. Watch list. Only reason I didn’t give it all fives which is great in that the only problem for me"
2017-10-02 17:55:00,Not working for me!!,5,Rican Dessert,False,It hasn’t been working for me for two weeks now! I have an iPhone 6 s plus! I have tried it before I updated my phone and it didn’t work. I have tried it after I updated my phone and it didn’t work. I have tried it before I updated the app and it didn’t work. I have even tried it after I updated the app and it didn’t work. I don’t know what will make it work so I figured I would right you so you can make it work. All I wanna do is watch my series and I can’t because NETFLIX IS NOT WORKING FOR ME!! Please make it work please!!
2020-07-11 16:06:57,Downloads are incomplete,2,Vctor Lima,False,"I’ve been using Netflix since 2010. Had issues in the past with various layout/functionality issues. This time I got it on an iPad and tried downloading House of Cards before a trip. Simple, right?... Wrong.

I get on a plane to find only some episodes were downloaded. Others have a completed download ring, but I cannot play them or update the ring to say downloaded. Connected to WiFi, says episode downloaded on the episodes list, but when I go to the downloads it is the completed ring and it never updates. Have to delete and download again.

Then Netflix app gives me a (!) saying “this episode can only be downloaded one more time”... But I never got to complete the download in the first place! Never got to watch it. What the hell is going on? 

I feel that over the years the quality of the experience keeps declining. Something that was an easy fix in the past has become too much for a company that got too big. Who cares about one guy for whom a coding error in the iPad version app became a problem. We are Netflix! We don’t need him!"
2019-04-29 02:58:16,Favorite show moved!!😔😔,4,Mr & Mrs James,False,I am watching once upon a time On Netflix. I fricken love this show. But I got on this morning and you moved it from the kids section to mAture. I’m just like what? Because lit last night watching it on kids. Like whaaaa. So I had to go back trough and change my account to adult just to watch my show. Now  everything I don’t want to see I can see. This ruins the whole parental guide for me. Now my parents can’t track what I’m watching. Alll because of one fricken show. Please move it back to the kids section or make an option available for parents to add shows (like mine) to a kids account
2020-05-28 16:23:13,Screen goes dark,3,G4cp,False,"Hey guys, I had Netflix for years, barely have issues but for the 3rd day in a row I had to delete the app and reinstall on my iPhone and I have no idea what’s happening. We watch it on our phone, iPad and tv never simultaneously it’s always one or the other but only on my phone now, I see the little icons with the numbers of new shows on the screen so when I click the icon app to open it it goes dark and I don’t see a spinning symbol or anything is just dark and it doesn’t open. I had to delete the app and reinstall it every time. This never happened before and it does not happen with any other app I have. Anything?
Thanks, Cici."
2020-05-03 15:33:07,Suggestion,3,DUNKaroo4218,False,"I like Netflix very much. It’s just that pre-teens and teenagers (I’m a pre-teen) shouldn’t have to sit through a bunch of either kiddy shows (this most of the time happens to pre-teens. I’ll be stuck with that for a while because I share a profile with a 5 year old) or a big category where they can barely watch ANYTHING because 75% or more is too inappropriate (happens to teens). 

You should add a pre-teen and a teen category. That way, in case I get my own profile in a couple of years, I don’t have to surf through baby shows. And the teens who sit through baby shows, same thing. Teens who aren’t allowed to watch almost anything, same for them. 

I hope you add this, because a lot of people have requested it and so I can find something besides Zig and Sharko (I will die if my 5 year old sibling puts that on again. Get rid of it and she will cry for days) 

And, why did you have to remove the 90’s DISNEY MOVIES?! I couldn’t watch them until Disney Plus came out. 

I hope #3 in entertainment passes you, second place! 😝"
2020-04-21 05:09:07,Love this app but security issues are disconcerting,3,Owlie cat,False,"I’m receiving emails in Vietnamese for an email address that used to be associated with my Netflix account. I contacted customer service but they were unable to change the language on the account and recommended that they mark the email address invalid. I asked them not to do that but I believe that they did, as I’m unable to access that old account to make sure that payment information is removed. I have not received any fraudulent charges but I’d really like to be able to access the old account and remove all that personal info. I am a current Netflix user and love this app, but the emails/cust svc isn’t great"
2020-01-21 22:44:56,Unable to watch anything,1,Kispurrs,False,"Recently I have downloaded the app to my phone because I no longer have a tv to stream on. I was not able to play anything at all using this app. I kept receiving a message saying “this title is not available to watch instantly” after doing research online and trying anything and everything to get this app to work, I have given up. Unfortunately you are not able to use your phone browser to watch Netflix either because it will keep insisting you download an app that does not work. This is very upsetting as I have had Netflix for several years and now I am unable to keep up with my shows. Hopefully this issue is fixed. Until then I will have to stick to streaming services that have functioning apps."
2019-09-13 16:37:41,Bring back Minecraft story mode,5,cudtpay,False,"I like how you have a games that you can play and Mika story mode with the best but there’s only season one and there’s more seasons than ever why don’t you add more of the seasons back up like every single season I get that Minecraft story mode it isn’t popular anymore but it can be again you put this on Netflix and then people see it there going to be so amazed me my brother love Minecraft and we love Minecraft story mode but our Xbox broke so we can’t use the game  please put out the other seasons in Minecraft story mode

I also wish you could download shows, and it says you can, butttttt......I tried and it would not let me....which is uppppsetting because some shows I just was wanting to watch off the grid. So those r my reviews"
2018-12-03 04:31:53,I don’t approve of some cuts,4,GoldenCamel77,False,"I love Netflix and will always watch it however recently Netflix has been taking off quite a few shows and movies which I thoroughly enjoyed to replace them with Netflix originals. They took off Malcolm in the Middle, Freaks and Geeks, and I just got notified that they are removing Friends ( one of the most classic tv shows). They keep trying to market new Netflix originals that are always movies that are not in my opinion any better than what they are removing. I always enjoy Netflix but I am becoming more and more disappointed by the selection and increasingly frustrated by their cuts."
2019-04-01 02:42:45,BRING BACK THE FIVE STAR RATING SYSTEM!,1,Genia929,False,"While I love watching the shows and movies on this app, I do not like the new rating system. It’s either thumbs up or thumbs down. Some movies/shows I do like, I would not give them a five star rating. Some I would. Some I would only give a three star rating. Some even less. However, with this new rating system, it feels like they either want you to like or dislike what you just watched. For that reason, I will neither like or dislike anything else that I watch. Too bad for the ones that I really like and unfortunate for the the ones that I only dislike a little. 
And for this reason, I’m only going to rate this app one star since it won’t let me give my review without giving it between one and five stars.
Please change it back!"
2019-03-12 03:49:30,This is awesome,5,2cool love it,False,Hey guys who ever is thinking of downloading this app don’t think twice it’s amazing the only thing is I live in Mexico and well we don’t get the seasons that the United States get and we always get them like 2 years later it’s kinda annoying and I don’t think that is fair over all the app is like amazing it has the most amazing and funny movies. There are so much verities to pick from I love this app it keeps me from all the drama that’s going on at school and lets me forget about it all. so pls make sure to get to that     Thing about Mexico. I love this app
2019-03-04 01:22:35,Downloads,5,Bob the dinasour,False,"hello. so i wanted to complain about a hitch in my download menu. so i just finished watching the umbrella academy and it was an amazing series but for some reason when i delete the downloading for the last episode white violin, the download is not disappearing. and since i finished watching it, i downloaded some episodes of ncis but it looks like the episodes are downloading by themselves. i only downloaded season 14 episodes but when i go to see my downloads episodes from season 15 are also downloaded and i didn’t download them myself."
2018-10-13 00:56:56,One mistake,4,cheegcheeg,False,"Imma make this short Netflix’s is good and all but my continue watching is packed. You can’t delete things from your continue watching. I know you can just fast forward to the end of the movie and click of fast but for your shows that’s not he same case it would take to long just to delete a show with maybe 3 seasons w/ 50 episodes    
All I’m asking for is one little button that can make all the shows and movies your not interested in disappear from your continue watching and back with all of the other shows that are waiting to be watched."
2018-10-12 19:44:19,Not able to download off cell data UPDATE,4,Nddiesel9,False,"I know this is a weird complaint but I am about to go on a trip and I want to download these videos on my phone with my cell data. They have the option to toggle the WiFi either on or off but it’s not letting me select it. I don’t have WiFi right now and would still like to download these videos for when I don’t have either data or WiFi. Pretty lame that you would tease me with the toggle and not let me toggle!

You can you just have to delete your movies you’re currently trying to download then toggle. Pretty weird glitch but it can happen."
2018-08-17 22:34:10,My interests and other interests,4,Rosetgfdgccfgg,False,"I have had Netflix for 2 years now and I am running out of things to watch that interests me.  The main thing I really watch is anime dubbed and I have watched most of them that isn’t rated TV-MA.  Anyway, the reason I’m making this review is to say that I want more anime that I can watch! I know that what is one Netflix is based on the interests of people in your region, so I want to be able to pick and choose my own interests because the interests of others might not be the same interests as mine.  I think it’s unfair that I can’t pick what I liked to watch in my region without anybody else’s influence."

Like in Australia y’all have added Lucifer to the catalog but in the U.S you haven’t added it at all tho!!! Could y’all please add the first 3 seasons already so we can rewatch them and prep for when y’all release season 4 since it is now a Netflix original??? Other than that, y’all have a great app here"

2020-10-15 04:28:42,Nonsense.,1,Scott..?,False,"I only have the app on my phone for when I don’t have stable wifi. Been somewhere with decent cell service, trying to download the same videos for 3 days, literally no progress. Had the app open the whole time. And when it does download, half the time it downloads the episodes of a series out of order, despite having “smart downloads” on.  So pointless, such nonsense. The Netflix content selection is mediocre at best, and they have a ridiculous habit of canceling their most interesting proprietary series after just a couple of seasons. The only thing they have going for them is that their stream video quality is superior to the competing services, but that is of no practical use when the app won’t follow the simple download command. Nonsense."
2020-09-22 20:58:54,Ok so here is my opinion.......,5,Cutie_playz09,False,"My opinion of this app is that it’s AMAZING!!! But here is my problems with the app, I wonder why you rate so many things tv-14 I mean I’m 11 I’m not allowed to watch that kind of stuff. I understand why you would give that rating to stranger things and riverdale and other scary things but I LOVE anime and enjoy watching it! But I can’t do that if you rate every little thing tv-14. Can you please take my idea into consideration? I would really appreciate it.

     Also, I’m so GRATEFUL you gave me this app that I can watch basically anything I want on it! THANK YOOOOU!"
2019-12-01 06:46:12,Update times,5,satans netflix,False,"I really love this app and how it’ll tell me when and what day I’ll get to see certain shows/movies but if you guys can update it to where it’ll show the specific time Netflix will update it at I’ll honestly be sold for how great of an app it is. And some shows do say that, “it’s official, another season is coming” before they even announce a confirmation about a shows continuation. Can’t it just be clarified through the app itself or do we have to wait until it’s actually clarified through other social networks?"
2019-11-30 16:30:56,Netflix,2,HufflepuffQueen12,False,"This was a great service before Netflix started to mass produce cheaply made movies and Tv shows. Instead of focusing on their successful Netflix originals like Free Rein, Stranger Things, Fuller House, a Series of Unfortunate events, etc. 
Netflix decided to fill it’s app with hundreds of cheap foreign movies. I have nothing against movies from other countries but the 
quality in most of the movies on Netflix is nonexistent. If Netflix would just focus on continuing their successful endeavors and taking more time to release and bring better movies to their services...

We don’t mind waiting for something great Netflix. What we do mind is having to dig through Netflix, and trying to find something good to watch. What we end up watching is something we’ve seen a million times. 
A friend of mine watches nothing on Netflix but The Office, Stranger Things, and To all the boys I’ve loved before. On repeat. 

We are going to both pull away from our subscriptions unless you get rid of all the garbage floating around. And no NO ONE likes it. It’s ridiculous that we pay $17 a month for one or two shows. 

Fix this."
2019-10-31 05:29:16,"Quite good, Just one mistake",4,'-' Panda,False,"So Netflix is pretty awesome but there is a disadvantage in the kids version of Netflix because whenever I’m watching MonKart some characters in the show aren’t talking at all and when I try a different audio it works so I don’t know what the problem is with this. Netflix is a good app though it’s fun to watch stuff on it, but you guys delete shows sometimes and people sometime love them because I was watching a series on Netflix before and it got deleted before I finished it so I want you to like maybe keep them instead of deleting. Hope you fix it and add my idea. Peace."

I finished season 1 and I’m dying to watch the other seasons. Everyone else has caught up on season 2 and 3 spoiling me with “Red Eye.” I’m trying to find other ways to watch the other seasons but they all need permission for payment which I can NOT risk. I love this show so much! But Netflix needs to add more seasons faster or else I will lose my insanity not knowing what happens next!! Please Netflix company! Ship your episodes faster! Some of us are impatient!!"

2019-07-10 04:07:01,A Few things,3,Johnfreakingalt,False,"I have the top plan with NF. Multiple devices. My whole Family uses it constantly. However there are a few things that as a business owner and consumer drive me and my family nuts. 

1. Not all movies and shows are available. And I believe some algorithm is choosing for me which is fine, but it makes all my choices. My wife and kids have shows and movies I can’t find and vice versa.

2. We have an apple adapter and want to watch on tv as a family and when we plug it in to transfer the movie to the tv the sound is there but the picture isn’t. I think this is intentional in the software because Apple is a competitor, but I could be wrong.

3. Plus, there are way to many foreign films with terrible over dubs, I never watch them, but Netflix must think I love them...UGH

4. The worst
 Is that I try to watch a show on NF and it drags and pixelates, but on ITunes I watch HD and it doesn’t. 

I love NF, and would give it 5 stars all day, if they would get there programmers to kick the executives in the teeth and fix these things."

I was so excited to see the latest update out so fast but I still have the same problem as in the first review listed below  and now my phone is draining the battery crazy fast as it's plugged in and watching Netflix. The phone is smoking hot after about 3 episodes of ""criminal minds"". Try again please. I love this app and want it to go back to working like it was 2 updates ago. 

I live in a rural area so the downloadable movies are awesome for me. I love the app. The new update screwed something up though. Now when a show or movie is over that I downloaded, I can not watch another downloaded show without turning my phone off then back on if I am out of cell service which is a lot for me.  It worked great before but now after a show is over it sends me back to my ""downloaded movies"" menu and won't let me watch anything els unless I restart my phone. Please help and get your next update out soon so I can give you 5 stars.

Thank you for fixing the bugs. My downloaded movies will play when I am out of cell coverage, my phone isn't burning hot while I watch downloaded movies. You fixed it. I'm back to loving this app."

I have my phone streaming Netflix in the background while at my desk, which I’ve done for years, and now I cannot stream more than 2 hours without COMPLETELY draining battery from 100% to 10%. I have no background app refresh on, no location services, all other apps closed and screen dark, YOU are what’s killing my battery. I expect some battery usage, obviously, but this is absurd. I have an iPhone 8 so I can’t plug headphones in while charging (thanks geniuses at Apple). I’m aware I can buy after market adapters, but shouldn’t have to as this has never been a problem.

I used to be able to find dozens of Disney movies, movies that I have always loved but they seem to have been taken off, in fact a lot of the movies I loved watching have been taken off. Now there is select few movies/tv shows that I will consider watching. I have recently been contemplating whether or not to cancel my subscription because I can’t seem to find anything appealing on Netflix anymore. I really hope Netflix decides to put more of the old movies back on, for the sake of actually finding something good to watch."

I watch a few movies in a broad category from anime, Japanese, Chinese and some do have a Audible in English that I can watch and some that are recommended to me are in their language which I don’t understand, I would love for a feature to be present in the settings where I can filter out all languages I don’t know and only have English or my preferred language for anyone"
2018-05-20 14:18:11,Apple TV App,3,Kamk95,False,It’s pretty good for the most part. Thanks for not letting it be as bad as the old Apple TV app for Netflix. However there are improvements that I think can be made in continuity and functionality for the Apple TV app. In regards to color scheme can you make it where it isn’t white solid blocks for when you are on the screen about to play an episode or even choosing another episode. I’d like it to be red like the color on every other Netflix platform. I’d also like to know roll back a couple of seconds. When I’m using the remote and I put finger on the edge of the touch pad the option to quickly roll back come up but never actually does it.

I really enjoy supernatural shows. And I was also wondering if you can take in other people’s suggestions. Even if you don’t add what I like, please listen to what the other people would like to watch. Thank you so much for your time and for reading this. Have a great day"

However, you get bumped down to one star because of some recent additions. I was really excited to see some Japanese anime shows had been added that I’d watched when I was younger. But, I was very disappointed when I found they were the English dubbed instead of the English subtitles version. Whenever you upload foreign tv, animation, or movies, please keep them in their original format with English subtitles. I hate the English dubbed version of Japanese anime & I’m sure other fans feel the same way. Unless you can get the original version of these tv shows & films added to Netflix in their original format, don’t bother uploading them!"

I’ve been trying to contact netflix for the last hour but I keep being told to try later. Not even 12 hours have passed since I subscribed to the service and I already regret it. Haven’t felt that frustrated in a while, at least Netflix could be more informative about the error, and not tell me to try to sign in in a few minutes when that won’t change anything. In conclusion, worst service I’ve tried, I would never recommend it to anyone."

Also, a couple of times I’ve been trying to find some shows that I used to watch and I want to watch again (R.L. Stein’s the Haunting Hour, for example) and I can’t find them. One of the things that would make this app sooooooo much better is not taking down old shows. And more anime. Definitely more anime.

There is caragoriez like comedies, things to watch with the families, and they put things that you should watch because of what you have watched before. BUT, I have one complaint, they took of my favorite show. This show was on here for so long and when it went away New Years 2020 I was so sad. This show was friends. Other than that it is a great app and if you ever read this then get the app."

If I click on something that I “removed”, it’ll show that it’s not added to my list but it still shows in my list with all of the other movies and shows. Can you fix this?

Update: I lied, I’m not able to add shows either. It does the same thing, tells me it’s added on the movie page but it doesn’t add to the actual list. PLEASE FIX THIS.

I know that all the shows that I did add to my list are still ‘in’ my list because when I click on them they say they are. But when I check my list it tells me to add shows or movies In to it because I haven’t saved anything. This is really annoying and I would like for this to be fixed because I can’t always remember where I left off or what’s in my list. Until then I rate Netflix with 2 starts instead of 5."

Unfortunately, almost all of seasons are gone, I don’t know if you are in the process of organizing your app, but you should never delete a show or movie that you think is watched a lot. Look at the ratings, please. I was in the middle of season 7  and didn’t get to finish it because the next day I planned on watching a couple episodes, season 1, 2, 5, 6, and 7 were all deleted. This show meant a lot to me, so 
STOP DELETING SHOWS AND MOVIES!!!
please.
The show I am talking about is My Little Pony,
I know it’s ridiculous that a 13 year old would like a kids show, but that show was my childhood and it’s my only thing I have let of my childhood. So please bring all the seasons back."
2018-08-01 06:33:32,Great!,4,Demigod Fan,False,"Really great app; well organized, recommendations are good, etc. etc. One thing, however; maybe put an option to remove items from the “Continue Watching” list? Sometimes I become disinterested in a show in the middle of watching it and it’ll stay on there because I haven’t finished the show. With movies, it’s easier because you can just fast forward the movie until the end, but it’s more difficult and time-consuming with multi-season TV shows. An option to remove shows and movies from the “Continue Watching” list would be very helpful. Thanks!"

The episodes aren’t arranged right so I’m not experiencing the show as it was intended to be (I know this because I checked sources of what order they should be in). I’m not the only one who’s complained about it but I’d really like to see them put in their proper order. Please?

I noticed the same old same old anime selection so then when I got off of Clueless and looked at the anime on the TV, there were so many other animes! Yes the same old and same old were still there but there was Japan Sinks, Devilman Crybaby, Anohana, and so much more!

After using the Netflix app by scrolling through options, maybe watching something, the menu scrolling becomes very buggy and eventually stops responding. 9 times out of 10, I have to force quit the app and restart it. Then it happens again after only moderate use. I have to restart the app at least once or twice a day. Internet connection and speed are not the issue. Software is up to date too. 

It has been this way on every Apple TV I’ve owned and I’ve owned 4 of them. Why this isn’t fixed after all these years, I couldn’t even start to speculate. They obviously don’t care about the Apple TV version. Plain and simple."

I have one small gripe with this streaming service though, the continue watching queue. Sometimes I will start a show or movie and part of the way through I decide I don’t like it and exit from it. Well it stays in my continue watching for so long that I wind up just going through it just to get it off of there.

2019-09-24 17:16:29,Full screen playback is weird,2,xyz_zyx,False,"Netflix has the strangest support for full screen playback on OLED equipped iPhones. First, I can’t double tap on the screen to switch to full screen, and there is no button to do it, either. I have to use the pinch out gesture, which is the most awkward way to do it, especially one handed. 

But this is a minor annoyance compared to the other issue - the app switches out of full screen playback as soon as I put it in the background, even for a moment. Why on earth would you think that I no longer want full screen more just because I put it in the background for a second to look at an email?! Please fix this obvious bug. It’s been going on for many releases."

I myself, don’t want to download more apps just to watch the next few seasons FOR ONE SHOW. I hope you fix this so that everyone that pays for Netflix can have all the seasons/episodes to their show. Just like me, I hate it when i have to RESEARCH how to get season 2 without paying, I personally think Netflix is the #1 TV shows, and etc. to watch from but, even if they already wrote a note about this.. Netflix should at least make 2 or more seasons.."
2019-06-01 16:43:52,Meh...:/,4,This is kitty,False,"I like the app, I really do! But o simply wish there was more of a variety of movies and anime’s! I know that this app is specifically made for all ages, but there are so many movies and “anime” that probably nobody watches. I simply wish hat you would remove those off that not many watch, and that have low ratings! 

I’m not saying you need to add these, but I really wish you would add movies like “The Blind Side”, or Avatar the Last Airbender, even One Piece, or Kamisama Kiss! I’m not at all implying you need to add any of these, but I would love if you experimented with shows, anime, and movies! Switching out the old with the new, see how it does and if it does good then keep it there. 

There were so many good shows, movies, and anime that you took off, and I’m crushed about that! 

I know this was a really long Drabble and you probably won’t pay any attention to it, but they’re just suggestions to possible make your app better.

My one concern for progression is that every account should have the ability to have a password on the different profiles. If I’d like to share my account with someone, I don’t want them snooping in what I’m watching. I feel the account holder should have the authority to put a password on their account.

Hell I was thinking about uninstalling it for a minute because I thought it was in my end. Wasting my time looking up stuff on Google for some mess y’all messed up in the first place!

Suggestions: 
1. Please remove the “are you still watching?” feature. 
2. Add a option to choose auto playing episode or manual playing episodes. A lot of people watch Netflix around bedtime and we don’t like waking up and being episodes ahead of where we fell asleep during."

I can download Netflix onto numerous devices around the house which allows access in an out of the house when playing off my iPhone, considering you are able to download and watch videos offline.
The only negative aspect of Netflix is some movies have to be purchased which means it can be costly. 

All-in-all, Netflix is a great choice for many, especially with kids who can watch movies when traveling by simply downloading them before travelling."
2020-05-02 18:59:50,Movies,3,Jonoryde,False,"I love Netflix however they are starting to take away great movies. I get that they need to do that but sometimes there’s no access to them anymore. The movies that there taking off are great movies that should stay because a lot of people I know love the movies, perhaps we use “Coraline”  as an example. That movie is my all time favorite and I was so excited to just hop in bed and watch it when I noticed that they took it off,I was truly heartbroken. I know these movies are old not a lot of people like to watch them but most people want to watch them because we love originals we love movies that takes us back to when we were kids."
2020-05-02 05:06:20,Madison,3,maddiecloer,False,"Can you please put more shows and movies on Netflix for the U.S because it isn’t fair that most of the shows that we would want to watch aren’t available in the u.s but it is for the United Kingdom and that it isn’t fair to us that most of the things we want to watch like me a teenager wants to watch the newest shows out there and up grade them on time instead of letting us wait for them, if you have a update coming please suggest that us teens like to have more movies and shows like the United kingdom and the United States, it should be fair to all of us on the app and not where we are located on the map to see what we want to watch."
2020-04-15 17:52:05,Pls Netflix I need this it’s all I can do,1,stoptakingallmgnucknames,False,I think that Netflix is not that great because it is unfair because it gives some places episodes weekly and we have to wait like half-whole year for the full season and that other places have movies that I wanna watch but I can’t watch them. And you guys block VPN so now only am I stuff not able to watch it and knowing I could’ve been able to do something but you blocked it there was like  no point of me buying a plan if I can’t even watch things I wanted to watch so guess ima cancel my subscription and give a 2 star because the unfair. And blocks so now we really can’t and you should either take of the VPN an proxy block or give everyone the same things that everyone else has and I’m very dissatisfied.
2019-09-14 23:52:50,Not interested,1,Carbybear,False,"I hate that I do not have the option to dismiss shows that I am not interested in. For that alone this app gets 1 star. I should be able to say that I don’t want to see the same show being advertised every time I go on the app, especially when it looks like it’s going to be a crappy show. Why is MyList not alphabetical? I know there is a search button, but there is still no reason for that list to not be in alphabetical order. Why aren’t all Netflix originals downloadable? During my commute on the train I sometimes want to watch something, but since I am unable to download that isn’t always possible. I mean I understand for shows that Netflix doesn’t own, but for their own original content this just doesn’t make sense."
2019-05-30 06:28:50,Television Shows,3,PleaseFixorHelp,False,"I find it pretty useful Netflix is coming out with its own original content. Although the distribution is poor. A lot of people like to binge watch a new eye catching show all the way up to the limit. I myself included. No one is going to want to wait months for a full new season to come out and then just hop back on track. No, they will forget mostly about the show and quite possibly not even try to watch the new season. Shows could possibly be shown weekly. It’s efficient and people will continue to binge watch on your distracting little app. As well as me as long as I can get a new season on a few shows 🤷🏼‍♂️"
2019-02-14 15:14:27,Glitch?,5,Ivyerlina,False,"So I was watching it and then I played the next episode and then the sound was not even close to what the subtitles and wasn’t synced to the vid. I restarted the app many times, I restarted my phone, updated the app, and nothing worked. It was still the same. Instead I just turned off the sound and read the subtitles, then, the subtitles stopped working, and the point of where I was in the episode, was incorrect, I was just in the beginning barely 10 min in and it said I had 3 min left... it’s a 40 min episode... help???"
2018-04-05 05:32:10,Issues with updates,4,LovelyForce,False,"I am a blind user of this app, and have found it to be extremely user-friendly. However, the last couple of updates have had a very negative outcome. I can no longer select a movie or show on my phone, and cast it to my TV. I don’t know why this is the case, but it is an extremely frustrating thing. I don’t have any other way of selecting Netflix on my TV, so the fact that I was able to use my phone and then watch it on my TV was wonderful. I can no longer do that, and I am hoping that this issue will be fixed soon."
2018-09-03 03:05:28,im kinda bummed out.,2,jerzcat,False,"Netflix. a great creation. im obsessed. the only thing is, there are certain shows that i want to watch, but they’re not on netflix. my family doesnt have cable, and we only use netflix. the movie Mean Girls, is my absolute favorite. it used to be Mean Girls 2, until they took Mean Girls 2 off, and added the original Mean Girls. i watched Mean Girls at least 5 times a week, then they decided to delete it. PLEASE BRING BACK MEAN GIRLS!! after they deleted that, i started watching the movie Clueless, but guess what. they deleted it. point being, it would be so much better if they wouldnt take off the classics to add netflix origins that arent very good. 10/10 love “To All The Boys I’ve Loved Before” and “The Kissing Both”, but i also love “Mean Girls” and “Clueless”."

But with this last update, im disappointed! I have to google shows now to get a summary of what the movie is about before i can decide if i want to watch it!! Hello!! Bring back the summaries!! Now all i get is if the movie is British or comedy or drama and that it!! I cant even see who is stars in the movie!! I dont know what you people were hoping to accomplish with taking that out but its not working!!!"
2018-06-11 22:00:13,Internet connection,3,ilovefriends101a,False,"You all might say it was just my Internet connection but I started watching a movie I really liked, I looked something else so I exited the Netflix app. It got me out of what I was watching and when I try to continue watching it said my Internet connection was down. But I had four bars. My Wi-fi was the highest it could be. Then I saw there was an update, so I said it was probably because I needed to update, but it still doesn’t work after I updated it. It’s make me want to scream my head off! The weirdest thing is all my other apps work. I even restarted my phone, and it didn’t work! I love the shows but I can’t watch them"
2018-06-07 10:29:24,Auto previews are the worst,1,jkgm,False,"The Netflix experience has gone from amazing to nearly useless with the addition of auto-playing previews that can’t be disabled. It feels like a dystopian future where every step taken is blasted by a different intrusive advertisement to the point of sensory whiteout.

As someone on the autism spectrum, I literally cannot focus on the description of a show when a preview starts playing. I now actively avoid launching Netflix unless I am navigating directly to a specific show, and I have completely stopped browsing for new things to watch. 

I’m pretty sure this is the opposite effect from what the marketing department is after. Hey Netflix, please consider the large portion of your audience who are non-normative and need to be able to browse in a distraction-free environment."
2020-10-03 17:13:28,Needs Apple TV app support,4,7thirteen,False,"I love Netflix and it’s shows, but I’ve been using it less and less once I realized that the Apple TV app does not include any Netflix shows because it’s not supported. The Apple TV app makes it so easy to manage the numerous content providers and it feels like a chore to open Netflix and search to watch a show. I’ve even started watching shows in places other than Netflix because it’s just more convenient. 

Netflix as an original content provider is amazing, but it really does need to sync with the Apple TV app like literally all the other tv services."
2018-03-18 04:25:22,Suggested feature: play random episode,5,Shirin0604,False,"I really wish Netflix had a feature that allowed me to play random episodes of a series to emulate watching cable TV. For example, cable networks play marathons of shows like Friends or L&O SVU, but the episodes are not shown in order. On the other hand, if I want to watch those series on Netflix, I have to find a particular episode to play and then they continue to play in order, which is unnecessary and less fun, especially for shows that many people are casually rewatching."
2019-12-24 20:15:31,"Netflix is really great, but it tends to be annoying because of one issue",4,👇👇LOOK AT THIS PLEASE👇👇,False,"I love Netflix. I will sit there and binge show after show, episode after episode, but something started happening. At first it was happening maybe once or twice. When I'm watching a show or movie, every now and then this green screen pops up and it plays the audio but not the picture. It's started happening more recently now, and gets to where it won't go away, no matter what I try to do. I hope this gets to someone who can do something about it, because I want to get back to binging."
2020-08-15 08:23:13,Bugs/Removed Items,3,FuzzylopBK,False,"A couple of bugs here and there, one popped up recently where when I watch on my iPhone the little autoplay next episode bar doesn’t work. Kinda crappy that Netflix is removing a lot of good shows too, people aren’t very happy about that. And when having a show on Netflix, maybe have all of the seasons, that would be nice. Some shows that I want to rewatch have had the majority of seasons removed (out of order I may add, so I can’t even rewatch in the correct timeline) or have been removed altogether. And please add season 3 and 4 of “Haikyuu!!” from what over heard, almost everything else has them but not Netflix."
2020-05-21 15:38:52,Teen Section,5,ʝąƴ ʝąƴ,False,Netflix is a totally amazing app!!! Everyone can use it you can shape and shift your profile to how you like it. But there’s one issue I have there is a kids section and an adults section the kids have a variety of kiddy shows and cartoons and the adults have a variety of everything but if the teens are stuck on the kids then we have to watch all the kiddy stuff. Don’t get me wrong some teens love watching cartoons but we also want to watch more mature movies and shows. So please Netflix make a teen category!!!!!
2019-07-28 11:34:14,The app is great but there are some problems,4,1488863582991,False,"Netflix has a lot of great shows and movies to watch, but there are two problems that are annoying. Number one: Some times when I go to watch a show on Netflix the audio is delayed by a few seconds which annoys me very much because I have to exit the app and go back in it several time until its fix. Number two: When I finish a series on the bottom it will still say next episode and it would take me to the first episode which is also annoying, so it see this review please fix these bugs."
2019-09-23 08:31:16,New Update,5,Lavendar❣️,False,"So, I’ve used Netflix for YEARS. Like, back when Blockbusters was a thing years. And I’ve always loved how the home page was setup. But now, I guess the app updated and the home page.. isn’t really.. all the great. I want my “continue watching” category back AT LEAST cause I don’t remember all the shows I’m watching at once😂 but, I did appreciate you guys putting them up there in a category. But why would you take that away from the “Home” part of Netflix. Fix this at least.

UPDATE: it’s fixed. Thanks so much💗🤟🏽"

2019-05-05 12:56:24,Amazing!,4,Blaze!11,False,"I absolutely love this! It’s the most convenient app and I love it. It loads when i have wifi, great movies and shows, and comes out with the new seasons of shows almost immediately after they’re out on TV! I just have one problem. Sometimes when i’m watching a movie, I see something that i want to screenshot or screen record and send to my friends. But when I try to do this, it ends up just being a black screen. I want to be able to share funny or loving things with my friends who share the same interests that I do, so please do what you can to fix this. 🙏"
2019-05-06 21:50:53,"Great Service, app needs a lot of polish",3,desmond.dsa,False,"Netflix is a fairly recent addition to my list of streaming services, and while the content is good, the app experience across the board needs a lot of work. A few options you might want to add, to made the viewing experience better,

1. Add filters - Genre, Popularity, Release Date, HDR, 4K, Dolby Vision, etc. For the life of me, I can't understand why these don't exist already, especially when they metadata already exists.
2. Mark as Watched - This is a fairly simple mechanism where I would be able to mark a particular show / movie as ""Watched"". So that it no longer appears on my home page or as suggestions."
2018-10-25 01:18:29,Would give it five but,4,pickles100008,False,Netflix is a good app but we need more movies and I was super mad when you got rid of spongebob the movie can you bring back spongebob and maybe the tv show I think there have ben about eleven seasons or something then I will give this five and can you make tv shows come on faster the tv show on Netflix for me comes right when like season seven comes on please make that faster but I’m giving this four because you did bring some movies back and tv shows back keep but the good work thank you for making this a good app i like that thank you and thanks
2019-01-04 04:43:41,Cool update y’all should do,3,The guy to listen to,False,Hey so like I appreciate the app and everything and i love how I can download movies so I can watch them on road trips but like when I download like 10 episodes it will try and download all of them at the same time and out of order. Sometimes the WiFi gets crappy and then like the second episode and fourth episode get skipped but everything else gets downloaded and I’m like what the heck. Could y’all put on an option that will download them in season order with priority downloading? Maybe like a queue list or something? Also an option that presents all the shows in a list for data’s sake. Thanks in advance!
2018-09-29 06:07:18,Old school,4,fookyouu,False,"Ok I love my Netflix but I kinda think you guys needs to bring back some of the old love story movies like pretty in pink, or sixteen candles, grease, dirty dancing, you got mail, 10 things I hate about you especially!!! Any classic section of love stories, I like the new ones but kids now a days have nothing to relate too like I did and I’m in my early 30’s! So please bring them back I wanna show my kid and what dumb love is when you just a teen with hormones you can’t control lol or just a person who loves sappy love stories (not the raunchy kind) I know you have them every so often but they are must keeps!!!!"
2018-10-13 20:58:12,Lost Center Pause and 10 Second Fast Forward,3,Maybe.itsnatalie,False,"I remember when Netflix finally changed its player interface to where the play/pause button was in the center and included fast forward buttons. I actually enjoyed that update for a while. However, I noticed it disappeared and reverted back to the old format. I was a disappointed. Though I realized it might just be for a select amount of people when I saw how a friend still had the new interface. I don’t understand what’s happening but I would really like to get the center play/pause button and fast forwarding back. It made watching Netflix much more enjoyable."
2020-08-21 22:55:16,Chile,4,jkimcooler,False,Let’s start off good I personally love Netflix I really do they have SOME good shows and movies BUT since corona virus Netflix has cut some shows who were supposed to have another season of in which has me mad on so MANY levels it’s crazy shows like The society and I’m not okay with this but can re-new riverdale and make movies that should not be cause EW 🤢but minus the mistakes it’s made this month it’s a good app with bunches of good tv shows ( other than 13 reasons why in my opinion I’m still mad btw Netflix) and movies ( like the kissing booth) but they have great things to see in every genre on this app 😁

2018-01-05 06:57:49,Absolutely amazing,5,Ad-Am-azing456,False,"Netflix has tons of selections, Movies, Shows etc. They make great shows like Fuller House, Stranger Things, A series of Unfortunate events etc. It’s 7.99 a month witch is kind of cheap, no commercials! And they put other shows other movies (from different TV channels) and you can watch them all day! That gives the name Netflix and Chill. Then you can also filter shows or movies that may be explicit! But if you want to Netflix and Chill just put the adults for more movies! I suggest you get it to bin watch your favorite shows."
2017-12-05 21:08:49,A Few Issues,3,Maddy Whinndy,False,"I love the app but a have a few issues with it. 
1: Shows don’t get updated quickly. If you don’t have a channel or a different way to watch the show, then you have to wait until the whole season is over to watch it.
 2: The ratings. Using the thumbs up or thumbs down method is very limiting. 
3: The movies are limited. Some movies seem to just take up space when Netflix can try to replace them with newer ones.
4: The shows/movies don’t flow through a cycle. When they take a show or movie off, it will most likely never come back. It would be cool if some could come back and just flow through a cycle."
2020-04-14 00:34:30,Teen please!!,4,StarWars4LifeBOI,False,I love watching Netflix. It’s such a useful app. Everyone in my family watches it but one thing bothers me. Why is there not a teen section?!? My parents don’t think that the adult section is appropriate. Some of it is but then there is stuff that isn’t. I just wish they made a teen section with PG and PG-13 t.v shows and movies. Now I’m stuck with a little kid section. Every time I want to watch something PG-13 I have to ask my parents if I can watch it in their’s. It’s just frustrating. Please consider my suggestion. Thank you. Netflix is a great tool to watch things just needs improvement.

Even though They already have a lot of shows on this app, I think they should add the series shadowhunters. Here’s why, I know shadowhunters is on Freeform and it’s free for anyone to watch, but when I recommend the show for my friends to watch they immediately go to Netflix thinking it’s on the’re. Heck some people don’t even know what Freeform is. So, if it’s possible maybe can you guys add the show shadowhunters. I think a lot of people would appreciate it:)"

2019-11-02 21:07:42,Complaint: Stop asking me Who’s Watching!,5,Digirajput,False,"5 stars because I love Netflix.
But writing a complaint, here it goes:
Latest version update added a “feature” asking to choose the profile of who’s watching every time I launch the app.
This is an iPhone app, iPhone is a personal device, so only one person is supposed to be watching Netflix from one phone. You know what profile was being used last time, why do you have to ask it again on every time the app is launched.
Please revert this change. 🙏🏻"
2019-07-20 01:44:42,"Great app, but neeeed more movies/TV shows",5,Lit Unicorn Reviews 🦄,False,"Netflix is a great app to watch many movies and TV shows. One of my favorite movies is To All The Boys I Loved before. One of my favorite TV shows are Riverdale, Legacies, and Stranger Things. The only problem I have with the app is it needs more and better movies and TV shows. There are only a few good movies and TV shows. Also, Netflix needs to add the seasons faster to the app. For example, Riverdale season 3 just came out. Netflix took a really long time to place the third season to the app. Overall Netflix is a great app. 😍"

I honestly love so many shows and have been addicted to many movies, but there is one simple problem. You get rid of movies wayyyyyy to quickly. I want to re-watch certain movies and I can’t because you have removed it. Netflix continuously does this, and it is the only thing that keeps me from giving you a five star rating. All I’m saying it would help you a lot more if you kept commonly viewed shows on your app and movies as well. It will make many customers, including myself, very happy."
2019-03-11 08:02:29,Nothing wrong just want you to add something,4,z-n-12,False,There is nothing wrong with your app just want you to add at least the six Season of Naruto shonea jump you have the first five seasons I just want more if there are problems that I don’t know about like a voice actor is dead then please tell me just wish you guys and girls would add the sixth season of Naruto I love it and I know many people who want it and you could also add Naruto shippen but nothing wrong just want more that would be nice.

2019-04-02 15:49:53,Amazing!,5,Pumpkin chritsmas tree,False,"I LOVE Netflix, and how many shows and movies are on it. Maybe you could even add a part where you could delete something you don’t want to continue watching? This app is AMAZING but I have a few questions... 

1. Where are all the shows?
Some of my shows disappear when I go back to watch them the next day, for example, where did Girl Meets World go? Now I have to watch it on demand where I can’t fast forward the commercials.

2. Can you only have 5 accounts!? 
My little sister watches about 10 minutes of every show and then gets bored. I need to make her an account so that I don’t have a million things on my continue watching list, but it won’t let me since there is already 5 accounts.

This is, again, an SUPERCALAFRAGILISTC app, but can you please get back to me on my questions? Overall, love it 🥰 it’s so great. If you read this whole thing you deserve a cookie 🍪"

I was going to watch the movie but I didn’t have time to. When I finally found time I sat down to watch on my phone but it was about to die so I switched on the tv and began to look for the newly released movie yet I didn’t see it. I looked back at my 1% phone and saw the newly released movie right there. I looked at my profile and account and I was on mine. I checked if it was on kids but I was on maturity mode ( no kids) I don’t know what to do help me Netflix 😩😩

It has sooo many shows and movies to binge watch! I watch it everyday! And it doesn’t expire an episode a day, so you can watch it anytime, but it does stop viewing a show from time to time if people aren’t interested in it. But you can find many popular shows and movies there! Like Riverdale, You, To all the boys I’ve loved before,Sierra burgess is a loser and more!  I definitely recommend this app!"

Sometimes I start something “new” only to realize I’ve already seen it and switch to something else, but now it’s forever stuck in my “continue watching” list. This happens a lot with standup comedy shows for me :/

Because of this, I’d also like the ability to remove something from my “continue watching” list. 

Would be nice to have a separate section of “my list” that shows me which series have new episodes."
2018-08-20 03:41:24,Netflix,5,SCswimmer1,False,Netflix is a amazing app where you can watch your favorite TV shows and Movies. This app is perfect because if you put restrictions on then it will limit your kid or adults to what you can and can’t watch. Netflix even makes recommendations for you. You can click on a movie or show and it will attach a percentage on what or how Netflix thinks you would like it depending on your choice. Netflix works on any device and it great. Netflix is family friendly and I definitely recommend it if you don’t have it.
2018-06-18 04:27:25,Auto play doesn’t always work,1,SoMuchMe,False,I contacted Netflix months ago they claim they opened a ticket I spent six hours troubleshooting it with a tag who said they would escalate the issue I’ve tried all the techniques to fix auto play and yes I’ve gone the route of going into my settings on my computer to make sure that auto place that correctly and that it said in the app but yet for some reason it won’t work I don’t have any of these problems with any other apps auto playing so I know that whatever it is should be able to be fixed by Netflix right? Wrong they haven’t contacted me back and every time I call they send me through the exact same troubleshooting this is definitely my last time dealing with this because I’m canceling Netflix.
2018-06-09 00:01:05,Why,3,ghostlywitch,False,"Netflix is a great app and website, and I’ve been using it nonstop for a very long time. But the deletion of movies and series are starting to get on my nerves. I understand that you must delete a few old things to bring in the new things but, I’ve noticed that Netflix has deleted shows a week after they’ve been added. I don’t know if it’s a computer doing it itself or if an actual person is behind the hand picking of an execution of a movie or series. All I ask is, at least leave a recently added movie or series up for a little while to give people the time to watch it, before you take it down."
2018-05-24 17:36:20,"The longer I have this app, the more Stars you lose!!!",2,hottchevy,False,That is super annoying!!! Im so tired of watching something at home and going to my phone later to pick up where i left off. But it doesn’t show that!!! I have to search for the episode THEN I have to find where in the episode I left off. Come on Netflix you’ve been around long enough to have already done this!!! Also when I add something new to my list from one device and go to another the new addition is not there!!! It’s so aggravating!!! AND I don’t like that I can’t clear my Continue Watching list either!!! The longer I have this app the more Stars you lose!! I keep hoping you will fix these issues. But you dont!!!!
2018-04-01 12:35:09,Overall Experience,4,hotdeo,False,"The quality of this app is amazing in addition to the ability of downloading and watching in high quality. There are two issue on iPhone X that I keep on dealing with however. The first is that the screen jitters between full-screen expansion and normal mode. Second, exiting the app from the video mode of the app sometimes requires me to swipe from the actual bottom of the mode rather than horizontally (i.e. the side). Generally unlock orientation on my phone so I don't know if that's the cause but it's very random. I can't find any pre-conditions to the problem."
2020-10-20 14:20:40,Amazing but some stuff....,4,11/20/19,False,I LOVE Netflix I’ve had it for as long as I can remember! But when the people who run Netflix take off shows or movies that people like or are watching it gets pretty annoying. My daughters used to watch this movie series called monster high. Netflix was the only app that I could get it FREE without having to pay. They were just disappointed to wake up the next morning and see it’s not there. And as well as other movies and tv shows to. All I’m really saying is Netflix bring back shows and movies that used to be on there please!?
2018-01-09 03:21:33,Great assistance and great shows,5,Stars 900,False,This app is addictive I don’t even watch regular cable I just go straight to Netflix ! I have the basic plan and left it logged onto a friends computer and they were watching it and I didn’t want to get charged extra so I logged all devices out and changed the password but it wasent logging out so I called Netflix and talked to Chris he said it can take up to eight hours to log all devices off so he gave me an extra screen for the day and I’m not getting charged the extra great customer services !
2017-10-01 10:27:05,New update,3,Puddinz,False,"since iOS 11 I notice that I am logged out of my account after each update Netflix releases. weird. Other than that the app works fine. 

*May 9, 2017 update* So basically Netflix comes out with update they claim is for ""bug fixes"" but actually they changed the outlook of the app. They moved the ""my list"" category and in doing so deleted everything I booked marked. I assuming that this is only for the main profile because my wife's profile is fine and she barely uses her Netflix account. I tired to add a movie to the list to see if anything would save and nope still doesn't show old list or anything new*****"
2020-08-21 14:14:57,It’s good....BUT,4,Sykaro,False,"Okay, so I understand that you want to help us find shows/movies that are similar to what we like to watch, but this is too much. Every single theme, be it horror or comedy, pops up as an anime. The only thing that should be anime is the themes that say “recommended” or “because you watched...” I have a hard time finding movies because it shows me the same thing for every row on Netflix, no matter the genre. I want my comedy and my romance rows to have comedy and romance movies, not just anime. Also....if possible, can you make the Seven Deadly Sins series as icon options? I mean, it is a Netflix show."
2020-06-04 03:10:15,Netflix,4,Floridian247,False,"I love Netflix. It gives me great shows to watch and lots of fun movies to watch with my family. But I would like if they had a sleep timer option. That would help out a lot so my family doesn’t have Netflix running all night long. But my biggest question is- “Why does Netflix remove shows?”. For example, my family loves watching “Cheers” from 1986 (I think). It’s a amazing show, but now Netflix is removing it on 7/1/20 (July 1st). And my family does not want it to leave. 

But over all I love Netflix if anyone is thinking about getting Netflix, Please do it’s an amazing app"
2020-08-01 13:45:32,Missing a lot of must-have features,1,Mihai S...,False,"1. No way to parentally manage (lock down) app.

2. Does not distinguish between different ages of childhood (toddler to teenager). 

3. There is no way to submit app feedback and bugs through the app, and there are no links or instructions in the app on how to do it outside the app. 

4. There is no way to download an entire season. So, if you want to download a few 20-episode seasons for a trip, you’ll have to do it one episode at a time. 

6. Downloads fail all the time if you don’t keep the app open and the screen on the entire time. You’ll start a download the night before a trip, and you’ll wake up with partial downloads (not even in order), and you’ll have to restart each one manually. And on, and on...

5. There’s no way to see what download limits each show has. Some are limited, some aren’t, and the limits differ, but you can’t tell the difference. You can only tell if they’re downloadable or not. And, when you hit a download limit with one show, you don’t know if it’s just that show or a bunch of shows or all your downloads for all your profiles."
2020-06-10 03:06:23,Bring Lab Rats Back to Netflix!!!!!!,1,bil2377jackas,False,"Why did they take it off, Lab Rats was the best show kids could ever watch and it brought happiness to kids , the more Netflix takes off shows for kids and shows for any age off the more I will not like Netflix,  so start a petition and start a change to create a new Netflix and new times!!! From now on every time Netflix takes off a great show bring their rating down so that they could bring the greatest shows of all time back make us, the people happy so join me in our fight to bring the shows we love and care about back. It is time to bring back Lab Rats, Kickin It and many more kids shows and adult shows back to Netflix. So help me out and we can win and have the greatest victory of our ERA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2020-06-06 17:35:13,LOVE IT,5,🐈😔,False,"Absolutely love Netflix, I’ve been using it for years. I don’t have any concerns, but maybe suggestions. My first suggestion is that I want to be able to change my profile picture to any picture from my camera roll, not just the given options. Second, I would like some sort of password on the accounts, this way not everyone can get into them and change the settings or watch all of their shows (especially kids who don’t need to be watching adult shows)"
2020-05-24 01:49:59,Plz no cliffhangers,5,The outer banks,False,"Netflix, this is probably the best app I’ll ever get in my life. Not only does it make it easy to stream anything, but you’re shows never stop making me happy. Even though I love Netflix sooo much, I have one thing to say. Pleeeeaaaaase stop leaving the shows on cliffhangers at the end of the season if you don’t continue the show. I have watched so many shows that leave you on a cliffhanger. I’m going to loose my mind. So please at least finish the show. THE OUTER BANKS. I need this for my sake, and everyone else watching Netflix"
2020-05-04 15:53:00,Become the worst app lately,1,peshiko,False,"Ever since corona started and people stayed home, netflix has huge problems. Constant buffering on popular shows/movies, downloads so slow it's near impossible (if they don't cancel by themselves anyways).

Sure you could cut them some slack since it's prob server overload or something, but they had over a month to fix it and they don't cut anyone slack on their bill either.

Would give minus one star because unless you have a US account, they randomly resort your list of saved movies almost daily to push their choices on you (mind you, not their recommendations, but a list YOU saved). So if you save more than 10 movies, good luck finding/remembering the recent ones you were really looking forward to."

2019-06-26 03:55:00,Deserves an honest review.,5,brian jr 71,False,"The app works exactly as its supposed to. Casts to tv, downloads shows, smooth performance. 

Every review here is complaining about things being taken away from Netflix, or not liking the shows they create. That’s now what you’re here to review- it’s the app, and how it works. Netflix can’t force companies to keep their shows on the platform! It doesn’t matter what you think of a show or movie - not only are you not a critic, you shouldn’t be judging the Netflix app on their shows."
2019-05-26 16:46:40,eh,3,raven15784,False,"i only use netflix when i want to rewatch a show or something because all the movies and previous shows i’ve liked get removed. For instance, i’ve watched Jessie before as a kid and it was my favorite, but when i went back to watch it again, it was gone. netflix also has this weird thing when i’m just watching a show, the screen gets all dark for no reason, but when i tap the screen, it goes back to normal, BUT the play/pause button comes up and it doesn’t go away unless i tap it again, but it also gets dark which forces me to restart the app in order to have a pleasant viewing experience."

2019-02-28 03:08:38,"Selection and content excellent, navigation fair.",3,Blind guys minds eye,False,"I am a blind Netflix customer. First, I must say that Netflix has dramatically stepped up the amount of content available with audio description. Audio described content for blind persons is critical. The only issue I have with the Netflix app on my iPhone is that the interface is non-intuitive, cumbersome and not well marked for screen reader access and interpretation. We use the built-in screen reader on mobile devices called voice over. Apple provides APIs for developers to include accessibility standards. Netflix, please, please, please make more of your app accessible and intuitive for voiceover users. Thank you"

But I try to search up new/trending shows, like Daddy’s Home 2, and it just shows a bunch of other comedies. So can you also add more popular and new shows/movies? Also a lot of items aren’t available to download, and that’s hard for me because I’m on planes a lot, and I have nothing to do, so I watch my downloads on Netflix but there isn’t much TO download. If you fix those problems then I guarantee you more downloads.😃👍

Like getting rid of a show you have no interest in watching, I mean if you don’t like the show after watching an episode of it there’s no point in keeping it in the “Continue watching list” it is an annoying hinderance, that starts to bug you after awhile, especially if maybe your kids ended up using your account instead of the one meant for them. It small things like this that NEED to be added into the app just make your life a little bit easier."

There is so much talent and Netflix’s allows people to keep freedom of speech. They have sooooooo many warnings for those who hate in Netflix’s for its content.

It’s good for adults, but for me it’s very boring and I have a taste. The choices for kids are bland and uninteresting and some of the good stuff was taken away. Avatar:the last air bender is something I don’t watch and We Bare Bears is something I actually watch. I prefer Cartoon Network over Nickelodeon. (I watch spongebob and some cartoons.) Overall, adults love it but I find it very boring I remember getting this and there was good stuff. But I got it again and looney tunes was taken off a week later. Very boring for kids and uninteresting. Bland.

I was watching a show and Netflix only provided 3/4 seasons, so now I’ll never know the ending!! And there is no variety whatsoever... either kids or adults. Like we want more variety and shows in other countries too!! We pay the same price... but we don’t even get half the quality. I think it’s a useful app unless u live in America. And if you’re only buying this app for you preteen kids or anyone between the ages of 9-13... don’t bother. They’ll run out of content within 3days."

2019-02-08 05:13:52,Good but,5,Shadowmoooooon,False,I love Netflix but I share an account and I have my own profile but my other family keeps going on and watching kid shows with their kids and it’s getting on my last nerve is there a way you can add a feature and lock it and you can open it with a password? That’s the only thing I have issues with but im just giving a suggestion about it and I want to be able to delete history so I can get them off my thing thanks I hope you take this into consideration
2017-11-26 15:47:35,Close to perfection,4,Unleashed1783883,False,"Thanks Netflix! This is a quick review of this app, not of Netflix itself. 
Love
1. I watched three entire tv shows at sd definition and only used 3.5 Gb! As someone who only has cellular data, i thank you. Doing that at low quality on Hbo Go uses like 14 Gb! 
2. Price per month is excellent. 
3. Reasonable selection of movies, although I believe there is not enough blockbusters, though that would likely be very expensive. 
Dislike.
1. Why aren’t all shows and movies downloadable? Maybe there is a reasonable answer to this, but it is not cool. I took time writing this review, please read it. 
2. OK so half the time my cellular data doesn’t work for some dumb reason but that is not your fault. So what I like to do is download movies but then for some reason when I plug them into my TV through lightning cable my phone then says playing on TV but the television just shows a black screen although I hear the sound. Please fix!!!"
2019-01-26 02:15:59,Function to delete from Continue Watching list,5,Elsa40,False,"I like to have my continue watching only list the shows I’m actually watching and sometimes I finish a show and then it does not go away from my continue watching. I don’t want to erase it from my viewing history because these are shows I like and want recommendations based on but I don’t want them listed in my continue watching list because I am not still watching them. Otherwise, I love Netflix and all of the shows on it."
2018-12-05 02:22:37,"If it wasn’t free, I would cancel it",2,ZZ hart,False,I have tried in vain for two days to find something to entertain me on Netflix. Nothing of any real substance. I used to love watching a foreign film but now they dub over the foreign language in English and subtitles are totally different than what they are saying. I can’t get into anything they are doing and it seems as though they are just concerned with the 13-28 year olds that watch the platform. Please stop putting just anything on your platform and stop removing content that some people might enjoy. And if you going to change around things...... come on Black Panther has been on for two or three months. Anyone whose going to see it has already seen it.
2018-10-29 02:19:37,5 stars if subtitles fixed,1,NinjaRamen,False,Need to fix subtitles watcha animal world in America and clocked English but it’s a mixed language film. Yet only non English languages had subtitles. Made it extremely difficult to watch movie without everything being subbed. The point of subtitles are to put audio down as text not translations. That’s secondary. One star till they fixed that makes the viewing experience terrible when subtitles are not available especially when the audio is terrible because explosions want to destroy your speakers but voice can’t be turned loud enough to hear or watching at night with the s/o sleeping and no subtitles or my deaf child not being able to follow along. Not the first time this is an issue but animal world really showcased how terrible t is.
2018-07-14 00:17:09,About the Defenders,2,Eduardo Pope,False,"Why you guys took out The Defenders from Marvel out? I just loved Luke Cage and the other Marvel Series and started watching the Defenders, with them all together, but could't finish. After a while, I started watching Luke Cage season 2 and I noticed that happened a lot of important things such as Misty arm and something about Matt Murdock, that I couldn't actually see it. So I started searching for the serie and find out that was not at Netflix anymore, now I am almost finishing to watch Luke Cage season 2 and still don't know what happens in the Defenders. I am still holding my self to not start watching Jessica Jones season 2 because I am afraid to have more Spoilers of the missing serie. Thanks for the attention, Eduardo"
2018-07-04 21:18:26,Worked great until I signed out all devices,2,hermiteer,False,"I had to use the “sign out all devices” feature from the website because a TV was given away that was still logged into my account. Unfortunately now when I launch Netflix on my iPad, it asks me to select a profile, then throws an alert dialog which I can finish reading because it dismisses itself, then a spinner comes up and dims the entire screen.  It just spins and spins and spins and never gives me a chance to interact with the app. This is 100% reproducible.

<sales pitch>
I’m an iOS consultant and would be happy to fix this issue for you.  Feel free to have your dev team reach out for more reproducing or even help in fixing.
</sales pitch>"
2018-05-22 02:27:25,Dislike the new update,5,Liz14061,False,"Overall it’s a great app so I will give a five, however, I strongly dislike the new update. If I want to continue watching something I know where to find it. I don’t need it popping up at the bottom of the screen. Constantly getting accidentally bumped. Often times there is a reason I stopped watching, but now Netflix is forever trying to force me back into it. With no discernible option to permanently make these reminders go away, I am severely disappointed in the new update."
2020-09-06 15:34:11,Love it!🤩But needs a few things..🤔🤔,4,orange 62,False,"Hi 👋!! I love Netflix I have it on my phone and I always watch it. But two of my favorite shows which I’ve seen all of the seasons that they have on Netflix they need the rest of the seasons because I really have been waiting forever!!Ninjago‘s last seasons and disney’s Bunk’d seasons to come out and I know there’s more because I’ve checked and they cost and I was really hoping Netflix would have them but they don’t.😡🤭😟😖So the creators of Netflix, please please please please put all the seasons on Bunk’d and Ninjago. Then you’ll have your 5 stars✨⭐️

2017-10-11 20:29:02,Going downhill,3,Super cute awesome,False,So Netflix was always the place to go when you want to watch a movie with the family.... in 2010 I just feel like each year it has more crash’s and less good shows. Netflix you are the place to go. And now I can’t watch some of my favorite shows because it crashes every time. Please I want to see the good old Netflix again I mean Netflix is amazing. But I just think it is going downhill. Make Netflix great again. 😆 so if you want Netflix build a time machine go back to 2010 and you can get some good shows. Hope you guys read this so you can do a good update that doesn’t crash thanks for reading
2017-10-11 15:46:47,Essentially useless,2,Raviyn,False,"Even though there were things that could've been improved, I liked the app well enough pre-Oct 2017 update. Now I can't even get Netflix to open on my phone or iPad anymore. It just does the black screen thing then crashes.

Also I hate the inconsistency of the new rating system. I much preferred the original 1 to 5 stars. The 'thumbs up' and 'down' system is completely counterintuitive. It's also annoying that the app and the web version don't use the same system so nothing syncs. I would love to get the original rating system back OR have a 'not interested' option so I don't get bombarded with shows I have zero interest in. 

Get your act together!"
2019-06-15 03:15:18,Bring some stuff back!,4,Wolfxø,False,"I like Netflix, but there are no longer any good shows or movies on here. I’ve watched the show One Tree Hill for example, but would like to re watch it, but I can’t because it was taken off Netflix TWICE. Also, I would like for more movies from a while ago. There’s mainly newer movies, and that ok, but I’d like more movie options. For example, Dreamwork’s Spirit: Stallion of The Cimarron West is a movie I’d like to watch again just to bring back the nostalgia, and avoid paying $20. So, if you guys could STOP taking off some shows and bring some back, that’d be great."
2020-06-30 20:12:45,Good way to watch movies and shows,5,geodude is great,False,"Hi you may be wondering if I’m fake, well I’ll give you the answer, no I am not. I really enjoy watching movies preferably on my iPad but occasionally on my phone the one main thing I’m into is Pokémon. At this point you know I’m a kid but I’m not like any other kid that just clicks 5 stars because they added a fart noise in a show I’m a kid that enjoys shows, especially the ones that are exciting like Pokémon. This is all I have to say but there are some small little things that needed to be fixed. Thank you"
2020-06-04 19:44:46,I’m annoyed at this point,3,Naty101200,False,"When I first got Netflix I would have for sure rated it five stars but as I continued to use it I realized they were getting rid of movies I genuinely loved. At first this was fine because I didn’t mind to much, but the whole reason I watched Netflix was to watch the nightmare before Christmas and coraline which were both taken off Netflix, at this point there isn’t much I genuinely enjoy watching on Netflix anymore and my only question is this, can you do plz do a survey of some type when deciding to take down a movie or show because it would mean a lot to have an opinion on the matter."
2020-05-08 03:47:02,It’s okay,5,a student with a good heart,False,"I love Netflix, but I have been drifting away from the app way before Coronavirus due to limit of shows and movies I have to watch. I love the tv I just think they should add more things. I also have been waiting soooooo long for another season of Heartland and When calls the Heart. I have just been killing to see Amy’s and Elizabeth’s babies. But just because I said this do not doubt yourself when downloading this app because I have actually been introduced to most of my favorite shows from Netflix😌"
2020-02-11 05:52:40,This may sound greedy bUUUUUT,5,ELLABOSSBOIII,False,I really like pucca ( if that’s how you say it ) and saiki k but in pucca..when Garu cried..I felt that and in hurt my heart dude. And I wonder what happens next because is Garu fall in love with pucca?? Will he be with Pucca? His cheeks went red when Pucca and him touched hand.. Now saiki k.. When I saw he go out of earth and in the stars I wondered did he do it?? Or he didn’t.. Well he be able to read Nendo’s mind? Will he be with Teruhasi (That’s how you spell it?) He “oh” at her so does he?? I have a lot of questions so please make more I wanna see more things! If you do THANK YOU SO MUCHHHH!!!
2019-12-16 03:36:05,Five star🥰,5,Gabrielle Mcbride,False,This is a very good app I lobe it but I would love it if it would work outside  without internet connection or Wi-fi but everything else works perfectly i suggest that you should get this app I have used it for my whole life and I’m 11 I have been using this app since could walk so has very good movies but I would love it if it didn’t delete so much movies but I’m not complaining anyways thanks for spending this much time for reading this review I hope you have/had a very nice day whoever you are goodbye😊🥰☺️🙂😄😃😀😁
2019-12-05 03:52:40,Can’t watch the end of movies,3,Sazuli,False,"The annoying thing on Netflix is that when one show ends it goes right into another. If you don’t act fast enough it skips the end of the music and goes into another episode or even worse into another series. So you can’t listen to the music and enjoy thinking about what you just saw. At the end of the crown you don’t even have the choice to watch the credits and listen to the music. They throw you into some other series you don’t even want to watch. How about giving us a choice Netflix?

Slay the only feedback is via telephone so you get this feedback on the public review"
2019-10-30 01:12:50,Great but there needs to be...,3,LessisMoore504,False,"...some improvements to the layout of the shows with multiple seasons/episodes. When a show has multiple seasons, it now goes in reverse order (I.e. season 5, season 4, etc.) which can be really confusing when recommending a new show to someone else. I just told a friend about Black Mirror, and this was a perfect example of why it needs to go in sequential order. Does the app know to jump to season 2 episode 1 when I’ve finished the first season?? Guess we’ll find out!

Otherwise, I’ve been a Netflix customer since DVDs were being shipped 100%. This is a great service. Cable is dead."
2019-08-15 23:34:33,Constant issues with iPhone lightning to hdmi,3,PickledLegs,False,"Lightning to HDMI is great when I only have access to a phone and it’s unlimited 4G. But when trying to stream Netflix using the lightning to hdmi there is always issues. Either Netflix will start showing the loading wheel during video then the picture will freeze and audio continues...OR it’ll just stop randomly every 5 minutes so we have to get up and unplug the lightning to hdmi, plug it back in, and reset the iPhone so it’ll work properly again for another 5 minutes. It’s quite annoying and to the point where I’ve considered not getting Netflix anymore"
2019-07-27 15:50:02,Why I don’t think Netflix is the best,3,oswald yogy,False,I’ve always loved his app but until today it’s probably not gonna be like that anymore. I’m sobbing as I write this for starters. As I just started to get into “Pretty Little Liars” I was on Season 3 Ep. 8 or something but then right in the middle of when I’m watching it. It says there was an ERROR and now whenever I type in “Pretty Little Liars” it doesn’t show up. So Netflix if you see this I hope you’re proud that you just made a 12 year old girl cry. And for your information Netflix isn’t the best on Earth..... but if they bring back “Pretty Little Liars” maybe the universe will have a change in stars and heart.
2019-05-27 13:29:29,Dark,4,Tdr4au,False,"I have watched Netflix on a tv, on a phone, on a laptop, and an iPad. Netflix shows and movies appear dark on all formats! When it gets to the actual dark scenes, you REALLY can’t see anything! Love Netflix, but that’s becoming a constant frustration.

Addition: The show Roswell appeared to be just one of those corny, light romantic dramas that numb the brain, which can be a nice background show or escape from the real world. However, the whole season is laden with cultural and racial stereotypes as well as gun misinformation, and perpetuates the already rampant tensions and the racial divide. Why does there always have to be an agenda?"
2019-02-06 18:55:50,Iphonex,4,femi9,False,"Since the last update the app fails to load after starting. It is not a connectivity error. It is just this app. It stays on a black and gray screen just loading for too long. It deters me from even trying to open the app at this point.

Edit: it’s the home screen. The home screen will not load and just keeps transitioning between a black screen with the bottom menu bar. The buttons on the bar load and work just fine. Please fix my home screen. This is not a new error. It started with the last iOS update."
2019-02-22 03:00:38,Options,3,JDP Racing,False,I like a lot of stuff you have available. But I want the ability to filter out shows I will never watch and the option to stop having to see your suggestions. Sorry I don’t want them... EVER.  Also the option to see shows only listed once. Not the same show in multiple categories. Yeah that goes against your algorithms but I’m very specific about what I watch and it would be easier if I can filter out junk that is unappealing to me than have your algorithms try to do it for me.  Because if you push it in my face I’ll never watch it. So please stop trying and I’m happy to do it for myself.
2018-10-20 01:34:43,I am ok app but there needs to be some additions,4,An Ok App But...,False,"I mean Netflix is great and all but there are some things that need to be developed or added. Like the categories, I can never find anything I like. In some cases though the shows in already like, like miraculous lady bug and cat noir’ now your prolly thinking why would she want to watch a kids show. Well it’s really good show but hasn’t been updated in a really long time, and another show is ‘how to train a dragon’ you took it off along with a lot of other good shows and movies which really annoyed me. But other than that great app👍🏻"
2018-11-17 19:17:01,Unhappy,2,kamyam3,False,"I have a big family, and we all watch netflix. Ever since the update, i keep getting kicked off because they only allow two people to use netflix at once. This was an awful idea. Do you know how annoying it is to be watching netflix and then a screen pops up saying “Too many people are on netflix”, even though i was the first one on. This is also annoying because you have to pay more to allow four people to be on at once, and i don’t pay the netflix bill, and we are already paying. It’s also annoying because we have been using netflix for a very long time, and this is the first time i’ve ever considered not using it."
2018-08-31 02:51:16,Take a breath ask what we want and update,3,Winnyf1145,False,"Really I believe you are moving to fast and loosing touch with the users of the app. As an example, on a new show you recommended for me I attempt to read a synopsis, no joy, it’s not possible through the app. 

Some of us don’t want to watch trailers unless we are truly interested in the show and as others have requested allow us to rate shows in the app. 

I hope you can do better, you’re certainly improving your content but don’t take us for granted, there are a number of companies asking for my streaming dollars and I’m going to have to start making some decisions."
2018-02-06 02:06:23,Some problems,3,Person61937282873928,False,"I think netflix is really good and it has a lot of different episodes or movies to choose from. But I think like all of the movies or episodes I have never heard about and they aren’t common today. I think it’s really unfair that you guys are taking away childhood seasons like Kickin’ It, or Jessie and Lab Rats. I really enjoy just watching them over and over but you guys are taking them down. I think you should also add more common movies like Fast and furious or really cool movies that a lot of people would enjoy. I think netflix is pretty good but they don’t really have good chosen things and you are taking away enjoyable seasons."
2018-08-16 04:23:23,Idea!,5,Kayla 00005474,False,"I absolutely love Netflix! I just had one idea that I think would really be beneficial. I think that on the Netflix mobile app it should leave you signed in to the account that you constantly use on that device so I don’t constantly have to click on the account and instead just go straight to the awesome movies. But if you wanted to change the account, it should still have an option for that, but I think it should leave you signed in for easier access. Love you Netflix!!!"
2018-08-07 17:02:57,Gotta say pretty good,5,Shoppingfreak2016,False,"Love love love this app! My house doesn’t have cable, so this app was my lifesaver when it came to watching certain shows. The Netflix Originals are great, and most of the movies on this are pretty good. I’m currently watching American Horror Story and I’m almost done with what seasons are available. I’m hoping Netflix can add the most recent season Cult before the next season Apocalypse comes out so I can be for the most part caught up. 
I would definitely recommend this app to anyone, and can definitely say it won’t disappoint."
2018-05-23 19:50:42,Too liberal and not enough good shows.,1,SilverStar-Burst,False,"I like some of Netflix’s available shows: Trollhunters, Spirit: Riding Free, Miraculous, etc. Mostly family shows, but Netflix is inundated with crappy shows and movies that make even scrolling through the available options undesirable. Too many horror movies, homosexual movies and shows, liberal propaganda options, and inappropriate movies and shows.

To top it off, now they’ve given former president Obama and his spouse a retainer, contract, whatever you want to call it. That is the final straw. My family will not pay Netflix to pay people like the Obamas. We will be cancelling our subscription before we are charged again next month. Fire the Obamas and we will come back, but until then no entertainment is worth that."
2018-01-04 11:04:58,Needs Some Work,4,SkylerT_Gamer,False,"I’ve been using Netflix for years and I find it a wonderful app but I just have some minor issues. I use a lot of subtitle because I don’t use the sound very often and one of the best features for CC is gone. Before the update, if you put on CC Netflix would remember that and the next time you go to watch something (or watch the next episode) it still has CC. But in the update when ever I go to the next episode it doesn’t save the CC and I have to manually set it up again. If you could fix this feature that would be amazing."
2017-12-13 01:26:40,Good........But one thing,4,☃️⛄️ sNOWMAN,False,"it's really good and for children with a lot of kids movies but one thing that I noticed was that some of my favorite shows were taken off like for example Soul eater was taken off for a while and the nightmare before Christmas so I suggest you keep the shows or movies, I don't know if you can do this but can you make more room so the new shows or movies can go in Netflix. But it's really good to watch movies or to watch shows More easy than to look a long time on the T.V so after all of that I give Netflix a 4/5 because of removing movies and shows"
2017-12-09 01:46:45,Netflix is pretty great!,4,Double the g,False,"Netflix is a great app to watch all of your favorite movies, and tv shows! The mix up the different shows and movies frequently. There's pros and cons to that. One con is if your in the middle of a season and the shows gets taken off Netflix it kinda is a bummer. However, if your a type of person who likes to watch different types of movies and frequently, Netflix is the app for you! It also has all different types of movies and tv shows. Horror, family, scfi, documentaries, romance, etc. Grab some popcorn and some friends to go watch some Netflix tonight!"
2017-10-24 00:43:51,One minor adjustment,4,Xtina079,False,"I LOVE this app.  Been using it for years and has a great selection of movies and TV shows.  My one suggestion is to bring back the star rating or give a middle option  on your current rating.   The thumbs up/thumbs down rating stinks.  It’s too limited and if I liked a movie but didn’t think it was fantastic then I don’t rate it which is then hard to keep track of what I watched.  Plus...... when you moved away from the star rating, it removed ALL movies I rated in the past, so now I don’t know what I watched previously.  Pretty annoying."
2017-10-28 17:05:11,App Needs Some Work,2,aperale,False,"I enjoy Netflix, but this app is bad. Ever since I updated to iOS 11 on iPhone 7, it gets stuck in buffering, even on WiFi when literally everything else is streaming easily. Since the last app update, I can no longer control the volume while in the app. I have to leave the app, turn the volume up or down, then go back to my show. I don’t understand what happened, or why I have had nothing but problems with it. Sometimes deleting it and redownloading it makes it work, but rarely do I actually get to open this app, click a show or movie, and just have it steam without issue. It’s really frustrating and I’ve started to avoid using it."
2020-09-12 20:16:56,Fav shows,4,~Lazy queen~,False,"Y’all are taking all the good shows and movies I actually like today I felt like watching mulan but when I searched it, it wasn’t on Netflix so maybe you guys should make a suggestion section where you can make a suggestion on what should be on Netflix . I think other people would like this idea. Pls make it happen. Thanks for your time on reading this . That wasn’t all! Please put young justice and the justice league (every season) back on Netflix I never got to watch it when I was younger because it just never came to me... it would  mean a lot."
2019-04-07 03:15:38,One flaw...,4,Tttsdg,False,"LOVE the shows. LOVE the ease of the categories. LOVE the features (since you watched, recommended for you, etc). HATE the new rating system.
You don’t just like or dislike something. I prefer the option of rating it by how MUCH not yes or no. Maybe I enjoyed the tv show, but it was poorly produced. Maybe I hated it, but the acting was great.
 Plus, It made picking movies a lot more difficult. I can no longer just see how well perceived the tv show or movie is by looking at how many stars.
I still love Netflix. With a passion. But I just completely disagree with this choice they made."
2020-01-09 03:37:46,Seven deadly sins... you blew it,1,Chip war,False,"I don’t want to be mean, but ever since the beginning of season 3, I have, and almost every person who’s read the seven deadly sins manga, have been waiting for the fight between escanor and meliodas. That’s almost a year and a half of waiting for a single episode. The episode was released today and everyone is disappointed. The battle was a mere 2 mins and didn’t even have good animating for 2 weeks worth of animating. This also goes for the whole of season 4. The animation is worse than anything anyone has ever seen. The seven deadly sins is by far your best anime and look what your doing. I recommend you fix this and reanimate. It’s a lot of work but you owe this to the seven deadly sins fans. This is enough for me to stop my Netflix subscription."
2019-11-25 22:47:19,The good the bad,5,ttlyomg,False,Netflix is good yes be my friends love watching except I noticed that they put victorious and Sam and cat are good except the best one of my favorite TV shows iCarly  like yes Victorias is good but I Carly is also really good so like I just feel like they should put it on because kids want to see it it’s not on TV anymore cousin said it’s gonna be like better there be more options because nowadays are barely any options to watch like I feel like I see them all so like you got a watch grown-up stuff now and that gets boring
2019-06-07 08:50:20,EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE,5,scavverz,False,"Oh. My. God. I’ve been in this room alone for 2 months... the lightbulbs have burned out long ago, I have been sitting in something wet so long it has given me a rash, but I can not foresee any moment in the near future that i will ever tear myself away from you. You are my all, my sunshine (like, literally you provide the only light in my entire ...i can’t remember where I am anymore...I am dizzy from the gallons of jolt cola and adderall ... you are my mother my father, my guiding light, and I can’t wait to see what happens at the final episode of fuller house!!!"
2018-05-13 00:54:51,Nice... I guess!,4,DillianTheVillian,False,"Netflix is a good app, right? Yeah, that’s what I thought most people like Netflix. Anyway there are some things I don’t like, so I was watching this show, and it said that it wasn’t showing on Netflix anymore. I was like, what? So if you watch Netflix, don’t get to attached to the show, or movie you’re watching. But yeah, other then that, Netflix is amazing. I give it one star less only because of the fact that when I watch something it just goes away. Also anybody, do NOT watch Santa Clarita Diet. My daughter watched it, and so did I. It’s not that... great. Bye! You’re welcome for the Review! ;)"
2018-12-02 16:29:39,U CANNOT TAKE F•R•I•E•N•D•S,5,Val_Gurl,False,"Look Netflix you been their for me for a long time and we’re pretty Gucci and all but we gonna be the opposite of Gucci when you take FRIENDS off of Netflix because that’s my main right there me and that show have been through a lot and when you don’t come out with the shows I want I know who I can go to and you know who that is, that’s right it’s FRIENDS but you can’t do me like this I’m a good binge watcher and I would also like to complain about the fact the the new season of On My Block has not come out yet"
2018-08-25 00:39:24,Missing seasons makes me see red!!,1,Oldbutgoody,False,I get so frustrated when Netflix adds 1 season of a series but not the other 2-8 seasons and I don’t mean a recent series but rather series made from 1990’s to 2010 so the entire  # of seasons were already released. The most recent  series I got fooled about was “Magnificent Century” which has 5 seasons but you only offer season 1 which was released in 2005. Since 2005 (that’s 13 years since first season)so all the seasons should be available. Since each season leaves with a cliffhanger that needs the next season to answer I am left hanging! If I knew there weren’t going to be other seasons to tell the whole story I wouldn’t have  watched the first season. Please don’t put just one season on and leave the others missing!
2018-07-10 21:04:08,I am frustrated,3,shrimpboygoat107,False,I was given a kids account and I recently found out that you can’t change the parental settings and can only watch PG or G rated movies and shows please fix that I am 13 years old and my parents allow me to watch any PG13 movies and shows on their account but I am tired of that. Fix it please. (Of there is any way to fix it please comment on this) but other than that and the fact that I usually have to wait s year or two for something I want to come out on Netflix even after it has aired on TV and that show series ended or the movie is out o theaters it is ok. Maybe add a teen account or something.
2020-05-01 00:59:08,"really good, but a couple flaws.",4,payton crespin :),False,"this app is really good!! i love it a lot, but there should be a few things changed. for example, when you screenrecord a part of a movie or show on netflix it is a black screen when saved to your camera roll. this should be changed because people (like me) on instagram have editing accounts and like to make edits of shows/people we like and we want to get clips off of shows that can be streamed on netflix. but it doesn’t let us do that when there is a black screen. also like many of us while we are traveling/in the car, people like to watch movies, but if your traveling to let’s say ax to california, you have to go through places without service, or places with service just not wifi. and it’s very inconvenient having to download the movies you want to watch while traveling. so netflix should be allowed to stream without wifi, and service."
2018-03-29 04:04:55,Add a show back!!!,5,Snapchat Letter,False,"Dear Netflix,
    This is Madelynn Hunt, and I have a complaint with ya’ll taking away my 2 favorite shows in the world. Malcom In The Middle, and Futurama. I don’t have the money or the channel to watch these shows. I also want to have House back. Please discuss this to the people who take these shows off, and please let them know that they need to really think about which shows and movies they delete or take off of Netflix. I really miss these shows, and they are basically my childhood. Thanks.
    ~Madelynn Hunt"
2017-09-30 18:16:23,CRASHING,2,Skylands fan,False,"Netflix is a good app. That is, t used to be a good app. Today, I tried to open it and it just gave me the loading symbol for a few seconds before it crashed. I did this a few times with the same result. Ok, I checked which apps were running in the background, and there were a lot. Fair enough, maybe that's why it was crashing. I closed all those apps and opened Netflix again, only to get the same result. Ok, I changed to cellular data. Still crashing. I refreshed the Netflix app. Still crashing. This has never happened to me before; what is it and when will it be fixed? Until it's fixed, it's unusable. 2 stars because at the very least, it USED to be good."
2020-03-29 04:34:25,just one problem!,4,Morgan Glass,False,I love netflix but one thing that bugs me is not being able to remove something I dislike or finished but it didn’t leave my continue watching. I’m not sure if there is a way to do this but i’ve looked it up before and can’t seem to get rid of it. It also makes me not want to start a new show because it will bug me that it’s on my continue watching even though the show isn’t for me. I really hope you give us a feature to remove the show/movie but other than that I love netflix!
2020-04-07 20:19:21,Renew your license,3,please don't notice me,False,"Look, I love Netflix. The only reason I’m giving it 3 stars is because of how slowly you put more seasons to a show. I’m currently watching the series “Black Butler” and I’m still waiting on season two. I’ve been doing some research and found out that show has been on Netflix for a long time now and used to actually have season two. People mostly think Netflix has removed Black Butler 2 or the whole entire series just because Netflix hasn’t renewed it's license for the show. So if that’s the actual reason you don’t give viewers the next episode or season to their favorite show, please renew your license."
2020-03-10 00:26:21,Still not enough,4,Abdulrahman Alhadlaq,False,"The app is very smooth, but still the content is not enough specially in Middle East region we pay the same amount of money as us users but still they have way more movies and series than Middle East region. Moreover, I’m a regular streamer on series like The walking dead and Homeland but you have the only seasons that has ended and I need to wait until the season ends to watch it! For me I might cancel my subscription just one month after subscribing because I can’t find anything to watch. 
“Netflix series are not my type nor their movies”"
2019-07-06 19:06:35,Netflix,4,clasicx,False,"Netflix is great!! I love how Netflix has been coming out with lots of new shows that are Netflix Originals. I ESPECIALLY enjoy Stranger Things. It brings sadness, love, anger, comedy, suspense, and happiness all together. Stranger Things 3 was by far the best season!!!! There are a few things Netflix should work on. I feel like they should add movies and shows from an older time, because lots of people look for movies like that, and always seem to have to buy them or rent them somewhere else. They should also add a better variety of romance and horror movies, other than that, Netflix is great!"
2020-03-09 21:50:00,"I Love Netflix, But...",3,I Love Game Pigeon,False,"Don’t get me wrong, Netflix is an amazing app. I love streaming my favorite retired Disney shows, such as Liv and Maddie and Girl Meets World. I also really like Family Reunion, Team Kaylie, Greenhouse Academy, The Healing Powers of Dude, No Good Nick and, of course; Alexa and Katie

As a teenager, I have overprotective parents that restrict what I watch. For example, I can’t watch Friends or Stranger things because my Netflix account is on PG. 

For those who are like me, I feel like Netflix should develop more shows that are age appropriate for teenagers. I understand that Netflix’s kid setting is mainly for underage people, however; there should be more shows like Greenhouse Academy and Alexa and Katie."
2019-12-04 04:03:09,MY REVIEW,5,BrendenRaps,False,"Absolutely love Netflix, I wish there was more of a selection of movies. I was wondering if I can recommend adding a spot for Netflix users to leave a review in their opinion of a show/movie. I request this because I’ve come across several movies and shows I’m unfamiliar with and would love to get peoples opinions before I decide to waste my time 30 minutes in something I don’t like. Thanks Netflix and keep the new stuff (along with older movies such as nightmare before Christmas etc) coming out as well."
2019-06-04 22:23:23,Where’s sixteen candles????!!!!!??!?,4,I dont mean to hate,False,"I’m thoroughly disappointed in you Netflix. Sixteen candles was my favorite movie ever and they took it off Netflix. What kind of sick being did this? I want to talk to your manager Netflix. Also you took off pretty in pink? They were the only movies I watched on here. Will be uninstalling. Do not recommend you download. 

(This is a joke but seriously Netflix I’m disappointed you took them off I loved those movies.) 
 
Also it’s so hard to find something to watch. Like I feel like there’s not that many things to choose from but there kinda is."
2019-05-08 02:19:31,I need more,4,Mgt404404,False,I love Netflix it is a awesome streaming sight but I would like to see more Marvel movies I really love all of them and it is a lot of money to buy them all separate for my family and then them be messed up. And my kids love how to train your dragon and avatar the last air bender and I know they are coming out with a live action avatar they are not adding how to train your dragon and I would love to see that. Other then the lack of main kids movies and superhero movies I love Netflix and use it all the time 9/10 recommend to people with out kids who will not stop bugging you
2019-01-07 10:19:18,"Love it, but.",4,Cap0808,False,"The only issue is that I pay monthly so I should be able to download an epsilon’s more than once! I fall asleep (mostly everyone) often watching my shows and then they expire and I can’t download them. I live in an area where I get no cell service and I don’t have WiFi. So this is the thing that saves my life now I have to skip ahead to give me something to download. I wish you guys would just up your yearly download limit for videos to 5 downloads or 10 maybe something higher than the 2-3 you guys give. Thank you, next! 👌🏼😊"
2019-02-13 23:51:54,ughh,3,emilyn22,False,"for the past day now it has been not letting me go onto netflix. it has worked for everyone else (on the same account) but me. it says there is a problems connecting to netflix every time i try to use it for the past week. i’ve tried everything, shutting down my phone, deleting the app and reinstalling it, nothing works. on my computer it also says there is a problem connecting to it, and it also says that my free trial is almost done. which would make sense but i’ve had my netflix account for maybe about 4-5 years. my family did change the password when this happen because someone who wasn’t us was on it, however i did use the new password and it wouldn’t work. i then deleted it and reinstalled it and it won’t even let me sign in, just saying it “can’t connect” and when i say retry it never actually loads. other than that love netflix however does need to add more shows instead of random, bad reviewed shows and movies."
2019-02-12 02:29:33,Glitches,5,melphd,False,"I love Netflix. It has all the movies and tv shows I love to watch, but lately I have noticed some glitches that haven’t been happening before. My audio will stay on but the screen will freeze up. I have to exit the app and come back, but then 5 minutes later I have to do it again. I know it’s not just my phone, my computer does the same thing as well. If this glitch is fixed it would be 5 stars but for now I would probably have to give it 3 stars."
2020-06-09 17:29:14,More Tween And Teen Sections!,4,Boba_Bear,False,"Dont get me wrong, I love Netflix. I’ve used it for a while and its got me out of boredom most of the time. But the thing that I don’t really like about it, is the sections. Theres kids and adult. You think that the kids section would have shows like tweens watch, but they dont. I dont think tweens and teens would watch nursery rhymes or toddler shows. And for adults, tweens and teens shouldn’t even be watching all the adult stuff! Shows like, “Alexa and Katie” and, “Greenhouse Academy” should be on the list. So I hope you see this, Netflix, because its coming from an actual tween."
2018-09-17 22:40:46,Why Netflix is so awesome,5,Tessa Caltabiano,False,"Netflix has really outdone themselves. I honestly love Netflix because you can watch on your TV, your phone,  your tablet etc. And I really like the good movies and shows and different genres they have. They have everything you want scary, funny and I really like the good movies and shows and different genres they have. They have everything you want scary, Comedy, romantic, and just basically anything. I love Netflix because it’s so nice to have new shows and really good movies and I really appreciate Netflix."
2018-07-26 19:09:13,Netflix VR Compatibility.,5,Driftwoods,False,"Thank you Netflix Developers for bringing such an outstanding app. I have been using Netflix for years and would not trade my subscription to any other video or movie apps. But with recent development of Virtual Reality headsets, I think viewers should be able to watch movies in a VR state. That would be a great feature, but I don’t speak for the rest of the users. I hope someone takes the time to read my review and consider. You have me sold all the way to the end. Thanks for bringing such a great app."
2018-07-19 20:20:21,Best app,5,RaterJenn1718,False,"I love Netflix. I love their originals. I love everything about Netflix. 

One thing I think would be cool to add, is notifications on the tv apps like the phone app. It would be cool to log in to my tv and have updates and notifications right there to see what’s new and new seasons of what’s on my list. 

But other than that, In my opinion Netflix will soon be, if not already, everyone’s main source of entertainment. Keep doing whatever you’re doing because it’s working!  I will forever be a Netflix customer!"
2018-06-19 03:08:04,Logging In Doesn’t Work,2,j.eun79,False,"I’ve been using the app for a while now. It’s more convenient using the app since I bring my phone everywhere. The problem is, however, is that the app refuses to let me log in anymore. I’ve tried changing my password, contacting support, looking up ways to fix the problem, checking my network, and updating the app, yet it still refuses to log in. I thought maybe it was a problem for others too, so I took a break from using it for a while. Weeks later, it still refuses to let me log in. I don’t know what else to do now, I’ve tried everything recommended by others online and on Netflix Support, yet nothing has worked."
2017-11-16 05:00:57,Works great but suggest improvements,5,Shaun aka Smurph ha,False,"This app works great as expected. No bugs that ive been able to find. However, i would like to add improvements to the app that would allow you to double tap the screen to pause the movie/show and double tap screen to resume play. Additionally, a way to delete continue watching shows instead of me having to log onto my account and removing each manually :) other than that I’ll keep paying for the subscription"
2017-09-27 11:54:05,Love this app it just needs some work...,5,Austin Raymond,False,"This app is one of my favorites, my family and I have been committed customers and have enjoyed it for years, but recently the app has failed to open even prior to the update, I don’t know if it’s my I pod touch or the app, I’ve tried restarting my iPod and making sure I had a good amount of storage, I have a good WiFi Connection, I was wondering if there has been multiple complaints about it failing to start, I hope this will help you guys in future updates!"
2020-09-08 02:47:29,Getting worse,3,bzy777,False,The selection has gotten worse since I have began. It used to be updated often and even on occasion had good movies. Now there is to much foreign stuff to sift through. Also who writes the descriptions for the movies and shows? They all sound like the same person wrote them. Honestly they don’t give any helpful information about the movies and shows. A five year old could do a better job telling the movie. I would make the filters and searches better first and fire whom ever is writing the descriptions. Maybe actually tell what the shows and movies are about.
2020-08-18 02:30:22,Great app! But.....,5,coolms@awesomenass!,False,"Netflix is a great app! I just feel like you should be able to delete things from your continue watching. Bc it’s really annoying how I start watching something, don’t like it, and then it sits in my continue watching for a few months and then just goes away. I want to be able to get rid of it sooner. Also, I think you should be able to go to a section called “genres” and there should be like documentaries, sci-fi, fantasy, etc. Thank you and have a great day!"
2019-06-09 15:58:28,Umm what ?,4,-b.n,False,"I love Netflix but I’m super confused lately 
I was traveling for the two weeks which I don’t think would have anything to do with this I hope but when I was in London it showed that I could watch this new weekly episodes of Jane the virgin which was season 5 but now it’s completely disappeared. And then I saw all 3 of the hangover movies but now that’s gone then when I was in Spain I was watching season 2 of good girls and now it isn’t there. And thennnn I was super upset because I also watched and added to my list all the Harry Potter movies but there gone now soooo what is this ?"
2020-02-15 22:56:39,Passwords,5,Sidny Jamal,False,"I love this app. It’s great when I don’t want my TV being loud while my parents are asleep and I can just watch shows and movies on my phone with my earbuds. There is just one thing I would really like to see, and that’s passwords. I don’t like that my parents or my siblings can just get on Netflix and get on my profile. I think that you should be able to set a password on your account if you would like. I would really like to have this, just giving a tip that could be very useful."
2020-01-02 19:31:34,No more itunes card pay???,2,Brooklyn112233,False,I’ve had netflix for many years but i’m thinking about ending my membership because they no longer allow you to pay using itunes which is the only way i can pay for it.... i love many of the netflix originals but i’ve found many movies and shows that i love that aren’t originals and then they quit showing them after a while and i’m beginning to have no luck finding shows and movies i enjoy... i’m using disney plus and the itunes store to find more shows i like and am using netflix less and less... i’d hate to get rid of it cause i love some of the originals but it’s so much easier for me to pay with itunes cards
2018-11-09 10:31:10,Downloading,4,KAYKLEC,False,"I love Netflix. There are a variety of different options and it’s very beneficial being able to download movies / shows and being able to watch it when your on the plane or don’t have wifi. However, the limit is around 10 downloads. Update that! Who cares how many downloads there are. I can only download 2 shows because the rest of my family always has a competition on who can get the most downloaded before a long trip. Overall, it’s a very great app and I’m happy to be part of this opportunity."
2019-05-20 00:43:16,Vanishing shows,1,samtheeverythinggeek,False,"Ok so besides the little buffer even when I’m on WiFi, I’m more so disturbed by the removal of really iconic shows. I realize its to make room for new shows but I frequently like binge watching shows from my childhood and their disappearing and I’m down about that. I know it was a while ago but I still miss avatar and mean girls etc. If they made room for new shows but still had room for those oldie’s but goodies a lot of their reviews would improve and they’d stop losing customers who have been watching and using Netflix for years. Corporate please look at the vast number or people complaining about this, and geez , come on, were paying more with the new cost for some junky “modern” shows replacing the shows we know and love!"
2019-05-11 15:47:54,Netflix is so GREAT,5,Maggie Ish,False,I don’t really watch Netflix on my phone but i think now was the perfect time to start because in a couple of weeks i will be going on a plane trip and i can’t take my chrome book and my tv on the plane sadly but i can take my phone and it will be great because i can watch all of my tv shows because of the download shows thing you added. I can easily just watch my shows at night without my mom and dad realizing that my tv or chrome book is on!!!
2019-04-07 06:26:50,More like Cataract Simulator — No HD/4K on PC (spotty at best),1,OwMyThumbs,False,"If you primarily watch on a PC or via the app, you can't get an HD or 4K stream. Different browsers have different limits but even that seems to not work. 720p on Chrome?! That's outrageous. Edge apparently allows better quality and that used to work but no longer, it seems. For the amount of resources this company has, it's simply unacceptable to take money in exchange for this shoddy service. Yes, I pay extra for the upgraded quality. I'm a professional video editor and have an excellent workstation with a large 4K monitor. Yet this state of the art company only delivers junk quality like it's 2003. I might as use RealPlayer. Often it will simply not work— ""Whoops, something went wrong!"" No thanks. Use an alternative."
2019-04-04 22:06:28,Problems Connecting to my Tv,2,nba youngman,False,"I always make sure that the app is up to date to ensure that I won’t have any difficulties connecting to my tv or have problems when I simply want to watch a show or movie but there’s always a problem when I try to connect my phone to my tv. Both devices are connected to the same WiFi and it mainly never works. When it’s trying to connect, sometimes it either completely close out the app on my tv back to the regular channels or it freezes up my whole tv to the point where my own remote will not be able to power it off unless I unplug it and that does start to get frustrating after a while."
2019-03-08 22:55:41,Netflix,1,fsutsjtsjgdychd,False,I tried to say it does not let you sign up so I’ll write a 1 to 3 or four not a five because it won’t let me sign up but it would let you sign in so that’s kind of confusing but I managed to try going to other apps tell you do music and watch movies and stuff but I would not get Netflix so yeah people in my neighborhood and never use Netflix they’ll use Roku channels and other things like that because I don’t trust Netflix they won’t let you sign up at all and it’s kind of boring I’ve been sitting here for an hour and I tried to set it up but selling the people that I call they tell me to convey their website I did and it will you sign up so yay for me 👎👎👎👎👎 Netflix is one of the worst things in the world can’t even sign up
2019-02-01 04:18:29,Just one issue,3,aquathoughts,False,"This is one of my two main forms of video entertainment, which I use pretty equally. I love Netflix originals. I love the inclusivity that their writing team brings. What I don't love is my sister logging into my account and starting movies and shows that I'd never watch and then I CANNOT remove them from ""continue watching."" I looked it up, and all instructions say to tap ""account"" under ""more."" These articles written just last November are void since ""account"" is nowhere to be seen since recent updates. Why take that away? Please bring it back or make it simpler to remove accidental watching. Please??"
2020-09-12 20:10:03,"Like it overall, but here are some things about shows...",4,applesandbannanas🍎🍌115,False,"The new Barbie series just does not feel right. I like the old Barbie series when she was a doll. In the old series, she had many of the sets I have, including the Skipper, Stacie, and Chelsea dolls, and the Barbie jet. That is why I am disappointed that there are not many episodes of it. Also, many of the cooking shows are rated ma or pg 13 just because of bad language. Could Netflix just tune out the words? In conclusion, I really enjoy Netflix, and so does my whole family. These are just some suggestions."
2018-10-23 18:39:32,Desperate Need Of Accessibility,2,RinnyRue,False,"I have 20/90 vision in my best eye, WITH corrective lenses. I can’t read half the titles on Netflix due to the chosen font or certain colors in the background. We really need an option to display the title either under or over the image tiles so we can actually read them. The native screen reader skips over all of the titles because it only sees them as images. This option would not only allow for low vision people to read every title, but also give those watching in not-the-best-coverage to actually know what the titles are without waiting two full minutes of staring at a screen with blank tiles in hopes that one of them grabs their interest."
2018-09-05 15:41:28,Unable to watch- flickering and shutting down,3,Dhudeks,False,"I have movies downloaded and have full internet service however for the past two days I am a unable to go more than a few minutes before the movie flickers and goes back tot he main menu and then keep flickering. I updated the app hoping that it would work and nothing, also tried resetting my phone iOS and nothing. Not sure what is going on but service is not working as it used to. Very disappointed as I am paying for a higher fee and unable to make use of the application as I would like to. (And I am using download movies)."
2018-08-16 10:49:55,"I absolutely have Mad love for this app, HOWEVER",5,Dontavius Wilson,False,"I love everything about Netflix, both my favorite T.V shows and movies on here. But, compared to the wide selections of Tv shows and movies in the US compared to the wide selection that Canada has, it feels as if though I’m not getting the full experience I expected to. They have shows like Star and empire on their watchlist in Canada, where as I have to make a different subscription from another app to watch those same shows, can you explain to me why that is?"
2018-05-10 01:12:13,Doesn’t work for Chromecast,1,Jake1239273772519:&.$7/@,False,"Seriously one of the most frustrating apps I’ve ever used. Has trouble connecting with chromecast and staying connected while I’m watching a show. Once it is connected and playing, I have to restart the app when I leave it or the screen turns off (literally every time) if I want to pause/change the show. Plus, it’s terrible for finding new shows/movies. Almost every single category is just a repeat of the same “new” shows. And instead of fixing functionality every new update seems to add some dumb feature that no one really needs. 

Overall really disappointing considering how much money Netflix has. You’d think they’d put some amount of effort something this important."
2018-04-19 05:35:34,Couple of Wishes on an Update,3,JustPlainBen,False,"Some of us are choosy about what we or our families watch and knowing the MPAA rating is helpful. When looking unsuccessfully for a rating it would be nice to know if I just haven’t found the rating or if it is unrated.

The other thing about the old star system (instead of thumbs up/down) is by leaving a rating I could tell if I had already seen a movie.

Please don’t label foreign productions as “international” and expect me to infer they will be speaking Hindi or Turkish. Tell me, maybe on the screen with “Details” — you know, where the ratings are — that the dialogue is Turkish but English subtitles are available."
2017-10-03 01:02:44,I don't like this 7-10 seasons of Futurama.,3,falloutboooii,False,"I love this app, at least I DID. now I only rate 3 stars. Because of Netflix deleting seasons and saying for you to PAY for them, I think. I don't know if you fixed it, but if you didn't, get to it. Anyways, I was going to watch my favorite episode which is in season 3. I hop onto Netflix, so see, ""where is seasons 1-6?"" No where. Frustrated, I close out, turn off my iPad, and slam it on my bed. Next to my iPad I flop onto my bed. I groan. Please get to fixing this, along with the bugs. Thank you! (I get if this is for money, btw. But I just can't buy these seasons if you have to pay for them, so I complain)"
2020-05-25 23:16:56,Love it but...,4,New bundle,False,"Probably should make it so that each profile has their own customizable subtitles. Make it possible to change on any device, not just my computer. It’s kinda  annoying to keep changing it every single time I get onto a new device. I was watching on my PS4 and the subtitles were on the wrong setting. I checked my computer but they were on the proper settings. I think it would be easier to make subtitles for each individual device, like TVs, consoles, phones. They’re all different sizes so it kinda affects how it’s viewed."
2020-09-07 04:39:12,Netflix is homophobic,2,ticftufyfyffyyfd,False,"the show I am not okay with this and many other LGBTQ inclusive shows have been canceled to make a Kissing Booth 3. there are a few things wrong with this. number one, I am not okay with this ended on a huge cliffhanger, so we will never get to know what happens. second, no one wants a Kissing Booth 3. but then again, no one wanted a kissing booth 1. lastly, by canceling so many great LGBTQ shows for a another movie that has no LGBTQ representation, is saying that Netflix doesn't want LGBTQ representation. even if that's not what Netflix meant by that, it's still sending the wrong message. let's face it, Netflix is blatantly saying they're homophobic, and that's not good for business, is it?

be better"
2020-08-28 16:04:38,Netflix shows,1,186741,False,"If you plan to buy Netflix, be really really sure that this is what you want. Netflix only has a 3.8 review because of shows or movies that some how are not available in the U.S but in other countries? We are paying Netflix over 25$ or more to ensure that our entertainment is truly satisfied. How can you allow other people to watch almost every show in Netflix but don’t allow people in the U.S the same rights? Netflix I only got one thing to say to you, you either fix that problem by lowering the prices due to only few shows or movies shown in the U.S...or you can just keep losing customers, because after I’m done with my 1 month membership, I will stop using Netflix until it’s fixed."
2020-08-11 01:34:11,5star🤩but needs some changes,5,lovely_xxx,False,I love Netflix in all but it needs some changes they need to add more new shows I know they are adding new shows but they need to add more shows like more bratz the tv show and more bratz movies and the 1990 full house and goosebumps the movie and wizards of waverly place and that’s so raven another thing to change is some of the TV-14 shows or movies into PG-13 another tv show you should put on Netflix is iCarly hope you see this review and take some of these suggestions

I can only watch it if I go to Mexico but I’m not gonna go all the way over there just for a tv show... also how can y’all take off a show who has actors that just live your lives and haven’t done anything to get in trouble but you have the nerve to keep the show friends who has an actor that deals drugs ?? 🤔 hmm might want to consider what shows you keep
2020-04-18 08:48:05,Issues 😡,1,itzz the one and only sqidward,False,Honestly I got the app because I want to watch this series and when you open the app it says sign in so I sign into my account I already have on Netflix and it says there is no account that goes by this email press try again or create a new account so I want to create a new account but there is literally no option anywhere that says create new account the only place it says that is where it told me wrong email address so like how the hell am I supposed to make a new account when there’s not even an option like what the heck Netflix fix it because that’s honestly dumb how could you say press try again or create new account when there is literally no option for create new account 🥵😡🔥
2019-07-10 22:33:33,I’m upset,4,UnCoolJ,False,"Netflix is a good app. No ads, lots of stuffs like movie shows and everything. BUTttTtTttT I have a complaint I feel like you guys are taking off most of the good movies. I’m obviously not going to name them all but the one that I was really upset about was... Meet the blacks. That movie was amazing and today I tried to watch it and I couldn’t find it and then I searched it up on safari and it took me to Netflix where I did find it but was completely unable to play it. I would really appreciate it if you brought back “Meet the Blacks”. Please and thank you."
2019-09-07 02:41:12,Hi,5,aReviews12345678910,False,Netflix is amazing and it works great but can you please add a password for the different accounts that you share with family or other people because i share my Netflix with my family and one of the people keeps watching on other people’s accounts like mine. There are movies and shows that are being watched on my account. I don’t watch the shows or movies. It would be amazing to have a password for your own account that you share with family. Thanks.
2019-06-17 16:30:42,Netflix the wonderful app,4,kbennett4,False,"Netflix is one of the best things to ever happen to us all. I love everything about it. It’s perfectly well organized. And has all my favorite shows on it. My whole family uses it. We especially love settling down and watching family movies, scary movies, and action packed movies. I have a ten year old girl at at home enjoying Netflix and the pool in summer. And I also have  a three year old girl at daycare and a husband at work, while we enjoy ourselves. We hope to see more choices on Netflix, and keep up the good work! Bye!👋😄🎬📷📸"
2019-07-08 03:27:11,Uhh Netflix?,3,iHATED-IT,False,"I don’t know if it’s Netflix being Netflix or if the app is broken but my list of queued movies/shows doesn’t display my most recent additions and they continue to display movies and shows that I’ve deleted weeks ago.  Oddly enough if it’s a Netflix made movie/show then it appears first without a problem.  If it’s, say, a non Netflix made movie/show, it’s no where to be seen. 

Now I would normally say it’s a bug in the app but ever since Netflix decided to pull the most normal rating system that has ever existed in place for some insane thumbs up/down system, I wouldn’t put anything past them."
2019-01-10 10:59:37,Pretty good,4,The one reader,False,"So I’ve been using this to watch anime and stuff and I really like the fact that you can skip the intro (anime openings are unnecessarily long). My only problem is that I think you should be able to delete watch history. Like if you hold it down or something and it says to delete. It would be great! Also, I kinda think you should add a category called “while you’re texting” and it’s full of shows you just have on the the background while playing games on your phone. I mostly do Friends, and Parks and Recreation. Thanks!!"
2019-05-07 20:02:57,Changing Seasons,3,ChibiAvatarTaang,False,"I watch shows at my friend’s house often, typically binge-watching a season at a time. She comes over to my house sometimes and we watch it at my place, too. I don’t appreciate that when I click the button to change seasons on a show, it changes back. 

Like, for example, say I was at the end of S1 on my account, then I watched the entirety of S2 at my friends house, then went to pick it back up at S3 next time. Everytime I click to season 3, it defaults back to season 1 or 2. It’s inconvenient and really stupid. Can you just fix that, because it’s so aggravating to keep changing the season."
2018-05-31 15:26:05,It’s Pretty Good... But,4,Gummiming,False,"I just wish there was a way to filter out shows and movies with certain ratings. Maybe I’m being stupid and there is a way to do that, but I haven’t seen one within the app. 
Basically, I am not allowed to watch anything rated R or TV-MA, and for good reason (I am definitely too young). I would like to be able to take those off of my Netflix app so that I find more shows and movies with more appropriate ratings for me. 
If there is actually a way to do this, someone let me know! I will definitely give Netflix a 5-star rating if I can do that."
2018-12-12 02:39:38,So-so,2,3578643578754,False,"The app doesn’t work nearly as well as other video apps. Movies often fail to download, stop and won’t resume or need multiple tries.  It should resume or re-try automatically. Prime video works flawlessly.

Needs better touch controls.  Check out infuse. Up/down on the left side of the screen adjusts brightness, up/down on the right side adjusts volume and swiping left/right does high speed forward/reverse to let you quickly skip parts or re-watch parts while being able to scrub to the exact spot you want.  A big company like Netflix should have these types of controls in their app if a little mom and pop app like infuse has them."
2018-12-03 02:08:43,DO NOT REMOVE F.R.I.E.N.D.S,1,Yout Favorite Camper Ahava,False,"Dear Netflix creators, 

I’ve noticed that you all have decided to remove F.R.I.E.N.D.S from the Netflix connection. BIG MISTAKE. I don’t think you all understand the power of that show for this generation. That show shows the importance of support, friendship, how to have fun without drugs, phones, or other daily tech we have provided to us today. That show has the power to completely reshape our generation. Please, please do not remove F.R.I.E.N.D.S. Personally, that show has shaped the 16 year old self I am today. It has taught me the fun you can have just by interacting with other people, the ability to speak up and just learn to live life through the smallest problems that could feel so huge. It’s made me realize that I’m a Monica, and the people I rely on in life are my Joeys, Rosses, Rachels, and Chandlers. Please don’t take the opportunity away that this show has to support the people who need it. I have lists of episodes to watch win every emotion I come by. That’s how strong it is. I beg of you all, with thousands of people with me, do not remove the most powerful show we have left.

Thank you,

Ahava Atar"
2018-08-28 03:07:05,Amazing App,5,BingeWatched,False,I binge watch shows and movies all the time. I love the app- it has many great Netflix originals and many other movies from when I was a child or even movies that came out. I love the shows on there and love that Netflix keeps adding more seasons and even more series from cable networks. I recommend putting the TV series ‘Castle’. I seriously love that show and I’m sure your app would get more viewers since it doesn’t air on TV anymore. Many other recommendations but the TV shows on there are awesome.
2018-08-19 13:40:04,What happened to movie/show info??,2,iACR,False,"This review is only about the app, not the service. Most people know Netflix by now.

When they updated the app about 6 mos ago, they removed the information section of the movie or tv show.  Now, when you tap on what you want to watch, you only see a few tags but no description.  The description is critical, however, when you are searching for new movies/shows to watch.  The descriptive info is present on TV apps (like Smart TVs).  So, it still exists, but has been removed from iPhone/iPad apps.  Netflix, please restore a descriptive information box or tab.  Its removal hampers using Netflix to search for what you want to watch."
2018-06-07 05:46:57,My love: Netflix,5,coolchick300,False,"Hi readers out there! I just want to say that Netflix is truly how I spend most of my “lazy days” and all of my hours that I should be doing important things but I’d rather watch my shows ;). I have spent the last three days inside watching Netflix. Some could say I have a problem, but most will just congratulate me on my commitment to this kind of lifestyle: the lifestyle of caring more about fictional worlds and what happens in them rather than caring about the real world 👍. That’s just how I role my dudes. Peace out ✌️."
2020-09-26 06:28:19,Add more shoes and have more language options on the shoes and movies,4,Ali merino,False,I really like this app but there is just a problem some shows you can’t change it to have it in English or Spanish  and same with movies.  Another thing is that there is barely shows there like last time I wanted to watch Demon Slayers but it wasn’t there and I like watching Winx Club but all the seasons aren’t there and some Disney movies of Cinderella aren’t there. I think they should just add a bit more shows for every age and I think they need more shows for 11 year olds.
2018-03-20 22:44:07,Subtitles are wrong,1,_mariaapg_,False,"I personally enjoy Netflix a lot and its wide selection of movies and shows, but recently I have been using Netflix to learn a new language too. I have started to watch cartoon shows in French with French subtitles, and I have realized that the subtitles often aren’t the same as the words being spoken. The overall meaning is the same, but the words are different, which makes it harder for me to know what is going on. I tried to see if this only happened in that one show, but I found that in many shows or movies the subtitles are wrong even in English. I think this is something Netflix should consider fixing for many people rely on subtitles to know what is going on in a movie or show. Thank you."
2020-07-22 19:48:37,The animes,4,iwpdlcbappcjwkcpqxkrh,False,"Netflix is amazing, but there is one thing I think they should do ( a suggestion ). The animes are amazing, all the classics and popular, but it’s dissatisfying and annoying that they don’t ever finish the shows, they don’t add all the seasons in. I just finished Naruto, and I want to move onto Naruto Shippuden, and Boruto, but sadly they aren’t on there. Fairytale and Attack on TotN also needs all the finished episodes. I’m not sure if there concluding to that right now, but please at least notify my suggestion!! (Please can you also add Demon Slayer on there, everyone would love to watch that!)"
2020-08-30 14:41:55,Too Much Original Content,1,PKMN Trainer Katrina,False,"And you wonder why there’s been a lot of people unsubscribing lately. Many movies have been purged/sent to other streaming services while Netflix creates more and more original stuff. Not going to lie, there have been greats, such as with Stranger Things and Lucifer, but Sturgeon’s Law is in effect here: most of it’s garbage, lest it be strange foreign films, creepy CGI childrens’ nursery rhymes, or SJW nonsense. It’s even been to the point that people have been making memes about this stuff (Anime -> Manga -> Netflix Original)!
And you WONDER why more and more people are subscribing to services such as Disney+, which not only have a reasonable price, but also a large library of quality content ALL old, new, and created specifically for the service."
2020-07-27 05:30:52,Im loving it !!,5,katy 😀,False,So I really enjoy watching tv with my family and the good thing is that you guys put a (family ) section so that it is ok for my younger siblings to watch I really enjoy Netflix but can you try to finish the series like pup school and the healing powers of dude and etc (plus can you put the box car children back I really wanna watch it again and I know that many more wish for that to happen as well) thank you for the entertainment you bring us i hope you have a great day !⭐️
2020-06-11 13:41:58,This is an amazing app but a few things...,4,Mossmoney6497,False,"I would just like to say this is an amazing app and you should definitely get it but just a few recommendations I think than you should add a Flash icon that you can be, I love the flash and I would like it to be my icon, second the downloads take way to long, I go on a trip to Florida every year and I watch movies in the car and when we’re about to leave I download movies to watch in the car but they always take forever to load and we are suddenly rushing like we should not be."
2020-02-10 05:28:30,I want more episodes of the Netflix show Some Assembly Requierd!!,5,awww yass itz sipunny,False,I love Netflix! But... I just want more episodes of some assembly required! You can’t leave me hanging on that last episode please! This was such a good netflix show I can’t even explain!please just ask the creators to make more episodes I beg you! This is too sad for me when I watched the last episode and it just ended there! Thank you for your time reading this pointless review.. I just hope to see more episodes of this show!
2020-06-10 00:05:13,Not all its cracked up to be.,2,AliChristana,False,Everyone thinks Netflix is great but it really isn’t. The have to same movies & shows over and over again in every genre. So the library of movies and shows really isn’t as big as it seems. Plus there is only so many good shows and you end up watching the ones you like on repeat until one lucky month comes when they put something new out in hopes that it will be good. To bad they don’t have another competitor because then they wouldn’t be so popular. I’m waiting to see how long it’ll take them to upload season 3 when other parts of the world already have it! Netflix is so slow... step it up!
2019-03-11 00:13:59,Continue watching list,4,hOllY 12181218,False,"I love Netflix, but I really wish that shows would actually leave your continue watching after you finish them. With most of the shows I watch, they go off of the continue watching like normal, but some, always Netflix originals, just stay there. It would be great if there was a notion to take things off of you continue watching list, just for when you decide you don’t want to keep watching something, but if not that then at least they should leave after I finish the show."
2019-05-24 00:44:58,Lovely app,5,ConnorGav,False,"This app is great and great for family bonding! I watch this in my free time when I am bored of video games. There are some many thing to watch that I enjoy! For example you could watch animal plant when your ready for bed and dramatic movie/series for all the time. Overall there could always be room for improvement but you can’t ask for to much. 
Overall his app is outstanding compared to others and there’s no way this could get better(other then some)."
2019-05-18 21:13:51,Some Suggestions,5,mms#8,False,"I love Netflix but I have two suggestions. It would be great if users could have more than one list or folders. My list is getting so long - I have movies I want to see, favorites, movies for my class, etc all in one list. It’d be great if I could organize it better. (We use the feature for different users in the household; I’m talking about having different lists or folders within the same user). The second suggestion is to bring back the star rating!"
2019-04-22 15:39:11,I like Netflix,5,llllllaaaaaannnnnaaaaa,False,I like Netflix because there’s a lot of shows and a lot of movies and series. I don’t know if it’s free or not because on TV it’s free but on like iPhone or iPad I don’t know if it’s free or not .I think you should get Netflix if you’re thinking of getting it because it has more movies and shows them the other apps. I recommend you to get it because it has more movies and shows and if you don’t wanna get it because it’s not free or there is not enough shows. So this is my opinion.
2019-01-21 06:08:04,More Options Needed,4,Isa06122,False,"I like watching shows and movies on Netflix daily, especially the ones I am interested in. I dislike it how I have to watch an entire series or movie for it to be removed off my continue watching list. There are some shows I have lost interest in and would like to remove my continue watching list, but I can’t because I have no option to. I would if Netflix were to add the option to remove a show or movie off the continue watching list if someone has lost interest in, just like me."
2018-12-03 06:21:06,Netflix,4,hiiamareviewer12345,False,The new netflix update is ok but there should be an option in settings where you can pick if you would like the older version of netflix like when the play or pause button and the skipping bar is on the bottom and the newer version is the 10 seconds back button and the play and pause button is right in the middle of the screen. I really would prefer the older version but overall Netflix is a REALLY good app. Also you should notify us when a show or movie is going to be removed.
2018-12-29 00:02:37,Bandersnatch,5,debb!e13,False,"The new black mirror interactive movie has made Netflix a whole new experience. I had been locked on my screen the entire day trying to not just master it but without completely messing with Stefan’s head, unfortunately I discovered that to not be possible. However, congratulations are in order for Black Mirror and Netflix as a whole, Bandersnatch has intrigued multiple of my friends and had kept us intrigued and entertained the entire time. This is certainly a masterpiece to be proud of."
2017-11-04 17:24:27,I can’t hold it back anymore!,4,Jdkdhshjdicudhhdjchj,False,"PLS! MORE LAB RATS! it’s the only good show I really love and I’m willing to watch for the fifth time! Two of my other favorite shows I have been planning to watch have just disappeared without a trace! I really wanted to see it but now it’s missing? And on the lab rats idea, WHY DID IT HAVE TO END ON A CLIFF HANGER!? Netflix, I love you so much, and you have been with me for the full ten years of my life right now. But honestly, I don’t know if I can trust you anymore. Please earn my trust back, and please consider this review. ( the shows that went missing are A.N.T. Farm and Mighty Med.)"
2018-07-20 22:06:41,Many problems,3,IbisX,False,"First off, since the new update, the setup is horrible. There is no go back fifteen seconds button, the exit button is on the opposite side, and the pause/play button is in the middle. I don’t enjoy this at all. 

Almost none of the Netflix originals are worth watching. There is nothing to watch anymore. All the good food network shows are gone. All the shoes I watched on repeat years ago are gone. All the cartoons my younger siblings watched over and over on Netflix are now gone. 

Netflix is great overall. But over the past few years, it’s been changing, and not for the better."
2017-12-19 19:52:22,Please stop removing!,5,blustew07,False,"Before I tell what I am telling… this is not a hate comment, just a suggestion. I as a 10 year old now have grown up loving Netflix. I just finished stranger things both seasons and I love watching RL stine shows. The show I was watching just now was called R.L Stines haunting hour or something which I watch so much. When I got into an episode it said that it would be avalible until January 1st. PLEASE DO NOT REMOVE IT OR ANY MORE SHOWS PLEASE, PLEASE ADD MARTHA SPEAKS AND CURIOUS GEORGE AGAIN! I LOVE WATCHING THESE SHOWS!😭Please…🤧I really enjoy this app but please stop removing my favorite shows"
2017-11-20 11:05:19,It’s great...,5,Zenzazional,False,"Great service with a good selection of shows and movies, having said that there’s also a lot of uninteresting stuff used as filler....a lot. There’s not much in the way of blockbusters and the one that are there really didn’t make much of an impact. One thing that needs improvement is the search and categories, you spend more time searching for something to watch than actually watching anything. Once you’ve found something though it’s smooth sailing."
2020-05-17 01:09:38,Subs not appearing and not all seasons,4,sarahburner,False,"So I watch a lot of anime on this app and I notice that whenever I watch it on tv, not all the subtitles appear. Fix it please? It’s been like that for ages. Also, why can’t you get all the seasons of a show? Once you buy the rights to a show you can put the whole thing onto your app, right? If so, I don’t think it’s that hard to take someone else’s show and plaster it onto your app, no matter how many seasons. If I pay you ten dollars a month to see a show, I expect to see the whole show. Other than that, it’s good."
2020-08-22 09:46:50,It’s ok,3,jay91708,False,"I LOVE Netflix but one problem I have with it is that there is barely anything for the preteens to watch. If you have a parent like mine then you know that they allow you to watch shows with little cussing and very little sexual scenarios. Also I don’t like that Netflix takes off shows to add new ones, now I understand that you have to make room for the new ones but I loved to watch shera and Jem and the holograms on Netflix and the next day that I went on it Netflix took both shows off. I know they were old cartoons but some people did like them. Hope you enjoyed my problem list lol bye"
2020-07-18 21:30:22,Some shows I would like,5,I need help color therapy,False,"Hi Netflix I am writing this review because I am just stuck in quarantine and I have been looking for some shows to watch. I have found a few shows that I love like vampire diaries and more. There is some shows that I would like to be on Netflix like HEROES PLEASE just have a look at this show because I would really love it if you could add it!!! Also if you can please have a look at the hunger games movies. Thank you and I hope that you can have a look at them!!  

-???"
2019-04-28 20:35:44,Please make this stop.,4,gsuakaavaiaoaosbshaia,False,"Oh my god.
I love Netflix, but this thing has been bothering me for the past few days. I like to watch Netflix on my phone, and when I open up a show on the app, the “pause, play, fast forward” buttons won’t go away. It will pop up so I’ll tap on the screen to get it out of the way, it will go away but not even 2 seconds later it pops up again, even when I don’t touch the screen. It’s getting really annoying and it kind of makes me want to close out of the app and delete it. So frustrating."
2020-03-30 00:23:34,"Naruto need more movie, series,episode please",5,mortal combat game killer,False,"Hey Netflix employees can you add more naruto movie, series, episodes. Like naruto shonen jump or baruto  naruto next  generation.

2019-10-07 06:38:03,Why Netflix is better in MEXICO?,1,THAKABE13,False,"I went for a vacation to Mexico and i payed Netflix there and it was a lot of cool stuff like teen wolf, the Grim, Avatar the leyend of Ang etc. But now that im back to USA all those shows desapeared and i downloaded teen wolf but i can watch it ever if the episodes are in my downloads  im just tired that Netflix is so repetitive  nothing gets my attention like when i jas on mexico i just dont get why in cant be like that in here  i know these will be ignored but i dont care i want all the good shows that Netflix used to have or i think i will cancel my suscription and i will find a better app to use because now netflix is not worth it. I wish you guys fix these or i will atop using these app and i know a lot of people feel me"
2019-07-30 00:57:23,I don’t know what to watch anymore.,3,CarolynM123456789,False,"I love supernatural shows I’ve watched all of the ones u have, well not all, but the rest of them are in chines or Japanese or in a different language. I’ll watch shows that are in Spanish but I don’t really want to watch shows that aren’t in Spanish or English I mean like not tryna be racist or anything but I just don’t understand and the subtitles just don’t make it feel real ya know, I think that you should add more shows that are supernatural or just in enGliSh ya know. I’ll recommend some shows😉 (I’ve literally watched everything on Netflix😒)

-Degrassi: next generation 
-sponge bob
-skam Austin 
-Teen Wolf
-The Big Bang Theory
-modern family
-anything vampire related 
-anything that involves teenagers and school cause like I’m 14 and like those typa shows (and I’m sure lots of other girls do I guess)

2019-07-20 05:27:58,Just an idea,5,woozelmcdoozel😂😜,False,"I’m really not here to rate Netflix, I just can’t find Netflix’s email. It’s 11:30 and I just came up with a good idea, I always have problems finding a movie. Netflix should have a random button that just chooses a random movie or show for you so you don’t have to look for something for hours. I’m not tryna get paid and I’m not working for Netflix I just thought wow maybe they’ll use my idea and I won’t spend too long looking for something I won’t even really enjoy. 😂"
2019-05-28 13:50:49,"Always freezing and stopping, giving errors and needing resets",2,Smond,False,"Netflix continues to raise its pricing, yet it never works seamlessly.  Paying more and more for a service that isn’t consistent doesn’t make sense. I won’t cancel, since a few of our favorites and daughters favorites are on here but I think about canceling often since it’s such a headache. Why does it always freeze? Why does it have an issue almost every other time loading a show? Why does it not let me log in sometimes? Why don’t our recently watched shows consistently show up in the continued watching?  Put the price back to the lower amount, because this is not quality."
2019-02-06 22:15:30,"The app is great, but...",4,omegoid,False,I love Netflix like most people. Has a great selection of TV shows and movies and this past year you guys have outdone yourself with the original content. My only complaint is that I watch Netflix from my phone A LOT. and I hook my phone up to my TV so that I can watch with family/friends. I find it annoying that I have to press the next button to get to the next episode every time an episode ends. Is there any way you guys could make it so that it plays the next episode on it’s own as it does from your laptop?
2019-03-14 21:24:43,Season 2? 3? 4?,1,Sgirl0246,False,"Netflix is not adding the final seasons of their shows as options for us to watch. I remember finishing the season 2 of a show like Yu-Gi-Oh Arc V , and then finding out that there wasn’t a dubbed season 3! Not even on Crunchyroll! I am thoroughly disappointed at the way Netflix is building us up to let us down. Just like the movie I used to watch, Mean Girls was it? Yah, they removed it literally a few days before my friends and I were waiting to enjoy it together. It’s not like there isn’t already a wide variety of shows on Netflix. But, it’s either you start and END a show, or don’t start it at all. Otherwise, the viewers won’t be satisfied, and it won’t make you look good no matter how many times you try to justify it."
2019-01-27 04:38:09,"This is a good app, but it needs one change...",4,👌😤🔫,False,"Don't get me wrong, Netflix is a great app. But recently it started to get buggy. At first, it works out great. I can watch most of the shows that I want to. Then after about two weeks nothing shows up. No shows whatsoever. So I get rid of the app and download it again. Two weeks later the same thing happens. After doing that three or four times it just says it's not compatible. I can't re-download it. so I'm not sure what to do. Please fix this. I'm in the middle of watching sword art online."
2018-04-02 05:56:51,Needs An Update ASAP,4,xoxoiloveapps1010,False,"Dear Netflix, I hope you read this. I have watched so many series on this app. It is amazing! I like how you can download episodes to watch them when you are offline! I also like that you can add things to your list and rate them. HOWEVER, I am VERY disappointed that the best Netflix Original series only have one season. ALSO, there are other series such as RIVERDALE that do not have a season 2 added on Netflix. There is a season 2 Riverdale out there, but it has not yet been added to Netflix. PLEASE, PLEASE ADD RIVERDALE SEASON 2 TO NETFLIX, PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE. THAT IS THE ONLY REASON I GAVE 4 STARS INSTEAD OF 5. THANK YOU."
2018-12-04 03:49:20,Ummmm why are you taking everything off Netflix,3,Ashley Solis,False,"Okay I love Netflix and it is my number one used app, but recently I’ve noticed that they are taking a lot of good shows. Like friends. If you end up taking off all of our favorite tv shows and just having Netflix originals, then I’m not going to give you my family’s business. I also think that always having more options is fantastic because lately there has been a drought in good TV shows, and our whole family relies on rewatching good tv shows like friends, while waiting for more episodes of another show to come out."
2018-11-20 03:24:18,Fun and entertaining,5,Garebear22,False,"I love the Netflix app and it contains really great shows. One thing I would recommend is multiple lists, like my list, where you can add different movies like you would in “My List”. They would be possibly be playlists or technically “Watch” lists and you could title them different things such as “Funny Movies”, “Movies that make me cry”, etc. Then if you were feeling a certain way you could find a certain list and find what you want. Overall though, very fun app."
2018-11-14 17:16:44,Bobs burger ( the one star I how feel with u momentarily),1,Pichi00,False,"I so disappointed on losing this show. It's my favorite (my family) we watch it nightly as we get ready for bed. I seen many many fans requesting you not to remove it, till it almost all gone. I emailed FOX and I was told it's up to Netflix that they couldn't control your programming. At least they responded. I'll also reached out to you never not one an answer. I tried direct email, Facebook, and twitter, thank you ignoring all of us😒 you have GREAT Netflix originals but with that said that's not the reason you grew to be the company you are, your fans love to bing and have availability to their favorite shows please stop removing them.
Edit: this is old don’t know why it never submitted"
2018-09-04 07:29:40,It’s good but it could do better.,3,Rinny/Yato,False,"I like Netflix for watching some of my favorite shows and movies, I think the app has become better ever since they added audio description for the blind or low vision. But I feel it’s a little limited as it’s only on Netflix originals. Even though some don’t have it at all or it’s only available on the shows original language, in my opinion it would be better if all of Netflix’s shows and movies had audio description and in other languages, that way a blind person or low vision is able to enjoy the same content as a sighted person"
2018-06-15 02:39:12,APP NOT WORKING50,1,IPAD APP DOWN,False,"Netflix APP for IPAD is down and Netflix customer service takes 90 minutes and three different representatives to state that they don’t know when it will be fixed, can not offer a credit for the time it is down, and that their recommendation is that their customers cancel their service until the issue is resolved.  Being told to use another device when IPAD is the device that is preferred is bizarre customer service to say the least.  When requesting that Netflix send an alert to their customers that they are experiencing an issue with their app, their response is they have too many customers to be able to send out that notification.  Unbelievable.  #notcoolnetflix"
2018-02-02 19:37:13,Great app just needs some kid friendly update,4,May zepol,False,"We love Netflix it’s constantly updating programs and movies we have been using it for 4 years.
One thing that would make it a 5 star would be to have it filter movies and shows per rating like for my kids I only like them to watch Y programs and shows and that's all but even when  I have set their profiles for young kids it still shows PG and G movies and shows which I don’t like for my kids to watch. 
Please make it easier for parents to filter what we want our kids to watch"
2020-10-04 14:28:24,One major complaint,4,DUHRANDOMDUH,False,"Usually I give games and apps five stars even if they have a few bugs or annoying things, because the developers worked hard on it, although this isn’t a bug and I’m pretty sure it’s been looked over. Recently, the subtitles have disappeared in some of the things that I’ve been watching. Countless times in Quantico, and quite a few in the 2 hour movie Enola Holmes.
Typically this wouldn’t prompt me to give the app 4 stars because I like almost everything else, but it happens way too much."
2017-11-16 00:55:21,“Bug fixes”,2,Jeorge500,False,"I was liking the Netflix app just fine until today when I got the latest update. The “bug fixes” addressed by the update changed the video player interface in less-than-desirable ways, such as no longer being able to pause by tapping the middle of the screen or jump forward or back using the sides of the screen. Also, for some reason playing videos now overrides my iPad settings of reducing the white point on my display. Since this was a work around to keep the integrity of colors on my screen, my Netflix now appears with severely distorted colors. I hope they can fix the bugs they made with this update."
2019-06-17 04:03:27,I don’t know what to title this,4,👨‍💻. 👩‍💻.,False,"Netflix is great, but when I start a show and I don’t want to watch it I’m still supposed to finish it or it will be on my to continue watching list which I don’t like it to be on. So, what I’m really asking is if there could be a way where we could choose on what we get to watch and what we get to “kick” off our to continue watching lost. I don’t know if this is just me if it is then that’s fine but it’s just a problem I have because I have a lot of shows I don’t watch on my continue to watch list."
2020-07-13 23:20:26,Needs software rework,2,ring6992,False,"Works great and love watching, the pain comes with the “Are you still watching?” Stopping playback that is becoming a giant pain. My son likes to watch a bunch of the shorts and it is always pausing playback, not sure if it goes off how many times it changes episodes or what, be we can watch movies with no problems but we watch 3 shorts and it keeps pausing... Allow me to turn off that junk feature and it would be good. I have contacted them about this via their website and I was told this feature works correctly and they will not do anything, but the problem is I do not want the “feature”, to me it is a nuisance."
2020-06-22 12:32:44,Love this app,5,123 PANDORA,False,I am always looking for a way to watch Netflix without WiFi and this might just be me but I can totally watch all my favorite shows on this without WiFi and the only problem is NOTHING I love this app it is the beat and I can totally at get this app it is like watching tv on your phone please get this app and guess what? It is free that is right free so if you don’t have this app then I don’t know what you have been doing your whole life like gat this app you will LOVE it thx for reading xoxo
2020-04-07 11:07:40,Shows,5,nelyanna,False,Please put friends back on here or put living single. And can you please have the dubbed anime already like saiki is a original Netflix series why is season 2 & 3 still in Japanese season 2 been out since July 2018. Also can you release the other seasons of black butler and fairy tale because I don’t pay for Netflix to be waiting so long why haven’t you added more to the anime section or more season the the ones already there I watch most of them already I need more
2020-03-17 03:33:17,Amazing!!!,5,jsheidbr,False,"I love everything about it! Most movie sites don't let you choose kid or adult movies. Like how Kids can watch kid shows,and the adults can watch movies like rated Pg 13 and 14. Most sites don’t let you choose. It is also amazing how there are many movies to chose from. Like hundreds! There is also no adds in the middle of the movie or episode. Which is amazing ,because every time I  get to a good part of a movie on some different site, a few adds show up. So as you can see, I LOVE NETFLIX!!!!"
2019-06-23 22:17:55,“My List” never works,1,Empty0623,False,"I do not understand why they even offer this option because it never updates.  I have stupidly added titles I want to watch later and removed then when I am no longer interested.  Yet, the app never refreshes “My List”.  

My second complaint is that suggestions have become too heavily weighted almost exclusively towards Netflix content for my tastes.  I would like suggestions that favored my own viewing preferences rather than items Netflix is currently pushing.

I’ve been a longtime Netflix subscriber from back when they only mailed you DVDs.  But this year I have begun to question if the cost of their services is justified, and I’ve become inclined to look elsewhere for entertainment."
2019-04-06 23:00:03,Why don’t you want me to hear your content?!,2,ashytj,False,"I love Netflix. The app is mostly cool, but I can’t use it to stream videos from my phone onto my projector if I have plans to hear it at all. 

I don’t own a TV. I just have my phone, and a projector. When I first got my projector, maybe a year or two ago, I could plug in my phone and watch no problems. Then, there was an update that wouldn’t allow sound to be played through projector. I got a Bluetooth speaker to make it work and now with this new update not even that works. 

I just want to watch Netflix on my projector with ease, why is the option to connect to a Bluetooth device no longer available?"
2019-01-20 22:28:53,Better check your bank statement twice!!,1,netflixisafraud,False,"Netflix flies under the radar by billing through different platforms be it iTunes, GooglePlay or Netflix or some other platform!  And it can result in you paying for the same account more than once per month! And they will not attempt to make you aware of it!!!  They will allow the double charging to occur as long as it does till you discover it and then will only refund you 3 months!  No, they do not ever claim responsibility for such errors!  They site it as a personal financial responsibility they YOU catch the double billing!!!  ARE YOU SERIOUS???  
Yes!!!  They billed me for over a year using 2 different billing platforms and they REFUSED to fix the problem and refund me!
I WILL NEVER USED NETFLIX AGAIN!"
2019-01-20 03:01:35,I Love it But...,4,Brenz1227,False,"I love Netflix and I think it has great shows and movies. But, I really really wish that the shows came out weekly instead of coming out as a whole season. I just started Riverdale a month ago. So, I obviously started late. I finished the 2 seasons. I was left on a cliffhanger (spoilers ahead) when Archie got arrested. Now, I see all of these things about the episode called “No Exit” and I really wish I could watch it on Netflix but I can’t; so now I have to wait until late May to see what happens. I really wish I could watch it now though"
2018-11-08 03:15:28,Problem with Subtites / CC,4,Joshesto,False,"I often watch a lot of shows in different languages on my phones and the plain white default subtitles make it hard to read what it being said. 

I’ve already tried going on the Netflix website (not through the iPhone application itself) to switch the captioning settings to no avail. I update the settings and go back to the app only to find that nothing has changed. 

**I also tried turning my phone off completely and deleting and reinstalling Netflix, doesn’t change anything.

I also went on to changing the captioning settings via the internal iPhone settings (Settings > General > Accessibility > Closed captioning/subtitles) and again it didn’t work. 

But yeah, other than that the app works much to my liking. The app would get a 5/5 from me if it weren’t for those captioning issues.

I’m on the newest version of the iPhone 6s version by the way."
2018-11-25 06:48:01,I need more anime!,3,patato_princess,False,I want you guys to put more anime’s like “Angels of Death” or “Noragami” and more and don’t forget “Noragami” season two! So please put the anime’s I said and more. Dont take out the best anime’s like “Ouran High School Host Club” or “Naruto” and “Blue Exorcist”. Also can you make a third season to “Vampire Knight”! And for some anime aren’t Dubbed but Subbed and for “The Disatrous Life of Saiki K.” Season two is not Dubbed but Subbed so can you guys Dub it so it can be easier!So please hear me out and put “Angels of Death” and “Noragami” please I have you guys three stars because I want no anime deleted and those two anime’s to be in Netflix and for more new seasons for every anime in Netflix!
2018-08-18 19:35:39,"Netflix, Please Read !!.. Just A Few Things",4,plajshdfbddijddndn,False,"Just a few things I would like you to add to your next or any future updates ;
  .A Skip Ten Seconds Button
  .If The Movie/Tv Show Is In German, Spanish, French, etc .. Anything Except English, Please Let Me Know !! It Is Extremely Frustrating When I Press On A Movie With An English Name And Description But When It Comes On, It’s In A Language I Don’t Even Recognise !!
  .More Serial Killer/Slasher Movies And Tv Shows - Scream And Slasher Were Amazing ! I Sat In My Bed For Four Hours A Day Binge Watching Each One .. When I Was Finished I Moved To FBI/Police Movies and Tv Shows. Speaking of those;
  .Can You Add More Of Those ? I Love Action And Mystery And Those Are The Things That I Look For On Watching Apps Like Netflix. 

Other than that, Netflix is an AMAZING app and I encourage anyone who might not have cable or might want to watch something that might not be on Tv, DOWNLOAD IT !! It is not free but it’ll be worth your money."
2018-07-29 23:22:42,Read‼️ please,4,Bluesnow1111,False,"I do like Netflix but there is a problem for me. I recently watched a couple of movies and it still showed in the continue watching,  so I went to my account and took it off and then I went back to Netflix to see if it was gone and it was still there. Then I went back to the viewing activity and I didn't see it so I'm just very confused on why it's showing up on my continue watching and it's annoying because it's taking up the space I need to see the actual things I want to continue watching."
2018-03-04 03:12:53,It’s mostly good,4,Kitten_lover,False,"I really enjoy the app. It has a large selection of movies and shows, and I can easily watch them. My only problem is the continue watching list. It’s helpful when I haven’t finished something yet and want to continue. But, sometimes I’ll be watching a movie, and then I’ll decide I don’t like it. I don’t want to finish it, but I can’t just remove it from my continue watching. This is annoying because I don’t want it there, and I should be able to get rid of it. Other than that, it’s a very good app."
2018-07-03 05:51:12,Recommendations Not Helpful,2,clsc1980,False,"My issue with the app is even after I thumbs down selections, days later they remain in my suggestions. Especially foreign language movies that are not even remotely similar to what I watch (genre). Yeah, it looks pretty but unless I know something specific, I am stuck with stuff I won’t and can’t watch. Tried making a new profile from scratch and it was the same issues. I gave it only two stars because yes, it’s smoother looking and yes, I can access profiles a lot easier. But overall, I’m seriously debating leaving Netflix all together since all they want me to do is watch stuff where I don’t even know what they are saying..."
2018-06-14 15:11:50,New Update Ruined the App,3,xXEmRoXxHiXx,False,"I used the app yesterday morning and then I updated it to the new update and now, even with my secure internet connection and the fact that it’s my own personal network (and nobody can use it but me due to my strong firewall and passcode) but every time I open the app it just loads and loads and loads. I let my phone sit unlocked with the app open (and no other apps open) but even after an hour it didn’t load whatsoever. I have the best WiFi in my room with full bars so I’m confused as to why the update broke the app. Please fix this because I’d like to watch Netflix again."
2018-01-22 03:33:06,Could’ve been a 5 Star,4,CHRISBORGAMIZZPRIME,False,I’m going to keep this quick and simple. I would say that Netflix is amazing. But there is one thing that keeps grinding my gears. Now for some reason there is a random space at the top and the description for each episode is not fully visible. Every time when I want to know what the episode is about I can read it until the very last line. If it were not for this one thing the app would be a perfect 5. So far that is my only problem and I hope that it gets fixed in a future update.

Undercover, Stuck in The Middle, and Bizzardvark. I love how you guys still have Liv and Maddie, Bunk’d, Radio Rebel, and Zapped. Its just those others were my favs!

2020-07-27 18:01:48,New maturity rating is out of line,1,Sheena99,False,"As a parent who uses the App Store maturity rating to help control what my kids have access to I am extremely shocked and upset that sometime over the past few days this app has changed from 9+ to 12+ (and category that includes the majority of questionable social media apps) when the internal Netflix controls already allow for much greater control over material for younger family members.  Now my children cannot access the app, and their personalized accounts, because I am not comfortable opening their devices to 12+ rating apps. If the age rating cannot be reversed for whatever reason that I can’t make any sense of, perhaps you can release a Netflix kids app?"

I really like what you’re doing bringing old movies and shows back. I suggest you add some more things like the drarry series (Harry Potter) I really tried looking for it. I know I can count on this app! I hope you read this. This is just a suggestion, you really don’t have to add it ❤️😅. I love this app so much!

2020-05-22 08:07:06,Shame,3,Dencho95,False,"First Netflix was outraged by how much money they were losing from people sharing their Netflix account with others, now they are giving link encouraging them to use it? 
Cmon, 
Please do not share the “gift” link Netflix gives y’all its just a way for Netflix to keep an eye on how many members share their account with others. Y’all should know nothing is a free gift from greedy companies. Share your account login info manually, do not share the link they so generously give people to “help” them share the account.

However, I travel weekly for work and your app is garbage. I’ll downloaded shows and halfway through my flight, it’ll stop and I’ll just get the spinning wheel. I can’t rewind or fast forward through your flawed download. Additionally, you want to say that my paid for, subscription downloaded show has “expired!” or I’ve reached the download “limit?!” First of all, I wouldn’t re-download a show if it didn’t “expire.”
Get your *stuff together Netflix. I pay you so I can watch your media. Not to have you tell me when it’s convenient for you."

Netflix is SUCH a great app, I really recommend it whenever you want to watch some TV shows or old movies you haven’t seen in a while, even though it costs money. This review is about the shows, though. That’s so Raven. That’s so Raven used to be on Netflix and then all of a sudden, you guys just...DELETED it! That’s so Raven hasn’t been on Netflix for years! That’s so Raven is one of the most loved 2000’s shows on Disney channel. I know that for a FACT! Please add it back. That’s all I gotta say. Please."

My question is, why is there a time limit on how long I have to watch an episode before the download deletes? On top of that, there’s a limit to how many times you can download certain movies/ shows. Why am I paying for this app then? It honestly makes no sense. Don’t increase your prices if you’re not going to provide better service. I should be able to download whatever show I want and not worry about my downloads getting deleted if I don’t watch the show for a while. Now I can’t even redownload that episode."
2019-07-19 15:58:01,"Get it together, Netflix!",2,npursell,False,"I have been a Netflix customer for years. I loved the service and quite a few of the shows they produced. However, they recently raised their prices and said it was due to them making more of their own shows. Many of these new series and movies are awful. It appears Netflix has decided in favor of quantity over quality. Yes, they put out a lot of their own productions, but it wasn’t worth the increase in price. Now, they will be losing several shows and series that I actually watch. I am now considering cancelling our subscription. Why should I pay more for something that I will now use less?"
2019-04-04 22:14:32,Good app but change one thing,5,kaka0@00,False,I like this app but I want you to change one thing you in every series or movies there will be a response section where you can type in things you think about the movies and series or you could tell the developer to add a season and this will go straight to the developers but not the Netflix developers the real developers and I hope it comes soon and other Netflix fans will like this version of Netflix and thank you
2019-03-31 23:47:27,Mostly Good,4,Lilly2179,False,I like the fact that there’s a selection of movies to choose from. Since the last updates things are not looking well. For example...when removing shows or movies added to my list that I have watched already and have removed from the list they are still showing on it. I would like to keep what I have added without having to go through each show or movie to check if it has the check mark letting me know that I added it to the list. Please fix this problem.

I noticed there were people watching in the account from Florida and Pennsylvania (I’m in Ohio). I changed my password and 2 days later I checked back and there’s people watching from Colorado and Pennsylvania. What the heck is going on Netflix. I have authorized a couple family members to watch and they are both in Cincinnati with me.

2019-01-01 04:51:15,THIS IS A GREAT APP,5,attalovitch,False,"I love this app, it has MOST of everything I want. The thing is it should have more Youth movies for 10 to 13 year olds. For an example it should have Spider-Man and dead pool, those kind of kid movies. It should also be able to be downloaded on older devices. For me I can not download it so I have to use my moms NEWER iPad to use the app. I fined that sad because I really want it to be on my iPad so I can watch stuff whenever I want. But overall it's a great app and if I where you I would download it. Thx 😀😎😄😃👌👍"
2018-10-08 21:56:57,Evilflix,1,ICUEvrywhere,False,More and more you’re pushing sexual content especially homosexuality too those who don’t want to view it. You’ve failed your subscribers by offering no filters and yet you’ll claim discrimination to those complaining when in truth you’re discriminating against those who do not approve of behavior like that. More and more you’re wrecking Netflix experience. Nobody wants to watch a full screen advertisement of another show while they’re watching series. Tell your Netflix crew too stop with the screensaver or put an option too disable it. We pay you money and without us you will cease. You’re being very disrespectful to those who don’t agree with content that goes against their religious views or beliefs.
2019-04-09 03:26:34,Fantastic but never perfect,4,Rob Nick Pi,False,The title says it. I’ve a subscriber since it’s inception. I guess the lack of feature constancy between the app formats is mildly agitating and the thumbs up/down rating system blows. I would like that if you give a feature a poor rating that it would disappear from your selections. Other wise it’s solid and I will keep on keepin’ on especially as they keep coming out with stunning original content. (A few more major releases in the streaming library would be good but I’m sure that’s more just legal issues).
2018-07-31 18:11:27,Good but a few suggestions,5,gabfdngbfvc,False,"When I was searching through I realized that most of the shows didn’t have all the season that the creators had posted such as the anime fairy tail only had 1 season on Netflix and really had 8 season in total but they just weren’t there on it. I really wish that you could do more to get all those episodes overall that’s all I have to say especially since I love watching fairy tail very much so please could you update that?   
Thank you so much!"

2. The ability to remove something on the “continue watching” list. Yes, I hated that movie and turned it off after 10 minutes, and no I never want to continue watching it. Please stop the torture of making me look at it.
3. Your newest version crashes every time I open the app or open a specific episode. Please fix.

Otherwise, keep up the good work. My procrastination is at its finest. :) Thanks!"
2018-03-24 17:02:34,Netflix app on iPad,5,Irene Sloboda,False,"This 5 star rating is for the excellent app on iPad. I can sit on my dining room table eating dinner and have no problem watching my shows with my WiFi connection, unlike some other apps where the show I’m watching constantly freezes up (for example the xfinity app). On the other hand I’m rating Netflix 3 stars for some of the awful recent changes. For the most part I still consider Netflix to be worth the money, hence the reason for 3 stars instead of 1 star."
2018-01-17 21:27:40,Love it but unfair,2,Superior Savage,False,I love being able to watch stuff on Netflix but technically it’s not free if the app is free then you shouldn’t have to pay for anything but you download the app thinking it’s free and then it says you have to pay every month and that’s not free they need to either make you pay for the app and be done with it or keep the app free and keep it that way for in the app so you don’t have to set up anything to pay it’s stupid to pay for it when the app is free so make the app free and charge NOTHING at all so no payments whatsoever no plans or anything or charge for the app make up your mind you can’t do both it doesn’t make any sense and that just isn’t fair
2018-01-06 22:19:32,Suggestion filters based on Ethnicity,3,Annoyed and still downloading,False,"I love all the movies and tv episodes available to watch.  I love to watch lots of different things based on my mood at the time.  I usually choose to watch a movie based on a story summary or category (romantic, food, comedy,...).  I am frustrated that after I watch something that has actors/actresses of a specific ethnicity;  the suggestions appear to be based primarily on that ethnicity.  I like movies with African Americans, Indians, Spaniards, Asians, Italians, ...   I want my movies suggestions based on categories first.  If I wanted movie suggestions based on ethnicity, I would choose to search based on that."
2017-10-19 13:52:08,What’s up with the screen orientation??,3,Lovethearts,False,"I’ll have my phone flipped a certain way, but when I load a show it’ll automatically flip to default, which is the opposite of what I want. So, I flip the phone around a couple times until the app recognizes I changed the orientation. Finally. I can watch my show. BUT. If I close out the show, (staying in the app) and load another one, the app will re-flip the orientation. It’s beyond irritating! Why won’t it automatically recognize which way I have the phone? It used to just flip as soon as the app opened instead of me manually having to flip it."
2017-10-05 17:05:09,I loved using it,2,SirMisha,False,"My problem now is all these frustrating broken updates. The rating system is useless at best. I know you guys are trying to go for more original content but you keep taking away all the shows I used to watch. It no longer informs me about new seasons of shows I have in my follow list unless they are Netflix originals. Last of all when it shows recommended movie/tv shows after you finish one it only recommends Netflix originals it doesn't matter that you just finished watching That 70s show, it recommends you watch True and the Rainbow Kingdom (Netflix original). Honestly why change something that worked well."
2020-10-07 22:23:46,Freezing and Crashing,3,doh1234567890,False,"I have had Netflix for quite a while and I have had few app issues until lately. Almost every time I open the app and select an account on my mobile device the screen freezes on the main menu and won’t let me select a show. On the slim times I can, the screen while watching the show has a delayed reaction to any time I pause or skip or access the menu like closed captions or episodes. The app is great but the recent updates have seemed to cause these issues. I hope they can be resolved in a future update."
2020-07-16 03:20:56,Needs more updated movies and episodes,3,heyyyyyyyq,False,"Netflix is great and all and I totally recommend it. But it doesn’t update the new episodes of some of my favorite shows. For example, one of my favorite shows is “One day at a time” and season 4 is still not on Netflix. Season 4 came out a few months ago and I’m still waiting. If there are no updated episodes how are you suppose to keep rewatching to series? Eventually you get bored don’t you? Anyway, it’s a great app but I need to stay entertained by the show and I can’t keep watching the same episodes over and over again."
2020-02-16 17:44:43,Good but got some bad spots,3,Addybell12345,False,"Very good and fast app, but hard to operate with constant updates and changing the way you use the app. The app also tends to delete all of the very good shows and adds either not very good ones or just very dull looking. To add to that I was  recently watching one of my favorite childhood movies and I noticed that they took out one of my favorite parts to the movie. It was only a little part but still why do they need to take this out. I don’t know if it was just a bug or something a little bit bigger but I think that they definitely need to fix it."
2019-12-31 20:37:40,READ THIS,1,one direction lover og,False,I love Netflix but I also love one direction and I am very mad that they are taking “One direction This is us “ of of Netflix we just got it back and now you are taking it away why most you destroy my dreams this make me very sad and a lot of other people are also sad too I am also very sad that Netflix is taking off “The Vampire Diaries” that show is the peanut butter to my jelly and so is the One Direction movie you see if they just left the One Direction movie and The Vampire Diaries alone then I would have gave them a five stars but they are going to take them off of Netflix so that is why I am giving Netflix one star so thanks for making me sad I still love Netflix I just they would leave those two things alone
2019-10-13 06:56:04,Subtitles?,5,aj.-.,False,"Ever since the new IOS 13.1.2, my subtitles on Netflix have gone to the option I made on my iphone settings in accessibility. So when I turn on Netflix, the subtitles don’t match up to where they’re supposed to go in the Netflix original subtitle box. So I get two white lines where the subtitles are supposed to go and it’s annoying. Don’t get me wrong it’s not a big issue but it’s an issue, and I need to watch with subtitles on but I can’t with those lines in the way."

He doesn’t want to change it again since so many people use it and he doesn’t want to have to tell them all what the new one would be. Our password has a “)” in it, on my phone this symbol doesn’t show up when i go to type in the password. When i go on any other app except netflix, it’s there in full glory. Please fix this if you can.. (No other complaints i love this app so much😁)"
2019-05-23 17:02:31,It’s a great app but... uh...,5,Doofjisjsckod,False,"So I had an account from a while back, and eventually had to stop paying, for reasons, and today I decided I want to start using netflix again, so I go to my subscriptions and choose a plan, not knowing that they delete your account after 10 months... so now I’ve made a whole new account, with the same email but I have to pay again, this kinda bothers me, could I get my money back for the account I thought I had but don’t?"
2019-03-11 04:44:54,Please bring back some movies,3,alisweetie,False,"Okay so I really like this app but a few updates ago you deleted some of the movies that were really popular. Example; mean girls. Like why?? They were really big and big movies= money! Like why would you wanna make less money? I don’t get it. Also, the late show problem. So for an example I’ll use riverdale. Riverdale has 3 seasons, right? Netflix only has 2 seasons, but if you go on The CW they have all the seasons, just like that. Same with flash! And you said season 3 isn’t coming out til May. Really? Like don’t be cocky here, you’re not our only source. Thanks for reading."
2018-09-02 07:07:37,The Big Play Button,4,c0c002,False,"I love Netflix hands down, but recently the past month in a half or so the play button, rewind and fast forward was an option in the middle of the screen. And now I’m just realizing it’s changed back!? Idk if it’s just my phone but it’s better the other way with the big play button in the middle of the screen. Before all the time I would rewind by accident instead of pausing or playing the movie!! Welp that’s it
Ps. Idk if the company is going to see this  or just for people to download the app or not......."
2019-03-07 17:32:05,Please fix the MY LIST category,3,Jasmine Minor,False,"I love Netflix and I spend the majority of my day watching different things via the Netflix app. The only problem I have as of now is that when I select my list, it still contains titles that I have removed from MY LIST! I don’t quite understand why this issue hasn’t been fixed yet but hopefully it is resolved soon. Also, would it be possible to show the most recent things added to my lift first. I would much rather see the titles I’ve added to my list today or yesterday, show up first, rather than the titles I’ve added 3 months ago!!!"
2018-09-09 13:48:22,What happened to the descriptions?,1,Doomwah,False,"I cannot speak for the version of Netflix that would stream on a TV screen since I watch mostly on my tablet, but I have no problem offering a low rating for the recent app update that eliminates program descriptions of any kind. This deceitful omission is fine for movies I have already seen and shows that I still watch, but the vague tags are a poor substitute for a summary that would actually touch on the plot of a show/movie previously unknown to the viewer. 
  We’ve already had to deal with a useless rating system and “match” percentages that are based more on public popularity than actual relation to what we watch, and now we have one more reason to ignore new material."

So not just this movie but others movies has issues same.."
2018-08-08 05:55:31,Summary,3,Stiles stilinski 😍,False,"My family and I have had Netflix for 5 years now and had never stopped loving it and the content it offers. However, with one of the recent updates, the summary feature was taken away and now you can’t read what the show or movie is about without watching a trailer or going into the move blindly. Although a trailer might give you some insight to the story line, some of the tv shows and movies included on Netflix don’t  have a trailer. In my opinion, this feature shouldn’t have been removed and hopefully will be reinstalled in the near future."
2018-08-06 20:25:39,I love but,5,Jozhiah,False,"I absolutely love Netflix I can literally spend all day on it and I love all the original shoes and movies and all the sections of shows and movies but the only thing that bugs me is this glitch/bug that shows shows that I already watched on my account and wants me to rewatched it over again and when I do it won’t go away and idk how to get rid of it but if you could fix it , that would be fantastic and I would love Netflix even more than I already do"
2018-07-14 19:17:32,All Netflix apps are terrible,1,H. Peabody,False,"The auto-continue-playing “feature” is excruciatingly annoying. I want to watch credits after a show or film, but the screen shrinks down, and I can’t read anything. So I try to rewind to read some end credits, but it’s an annoying game of pausing it in time before the screen shrinks down. 
Trailers auto-playing is equally annoying. One, I only want to watch trailers that I choose. And Two, there’s junk floating on top of the video. 
Netflix wants their customers to keep watching content, but their methods can easily annoy viewers and force them to find workarounds or fight with a countdown to watch what they want to watch. 
Netflix needs only to add some optional settings to remedy this."
2018-07-02 19:17:09,Deleting app and canceling,1,tim0310af,False,"Nothing but Old movies that no one wanted to watch when they came out the first time and Boring comedy routing that just talk about politics from a very liberal perspective and insult the president. (Which is fine, it’s their opinion. I just don’t want to hear about it because it’s not real comedy.) If I wanted to watch this I would watch CNN not Netflix. Netflix has become far to liberal and politically involved for my taste, you hear it enough on tv I don’t want to hear about it on an app I’m paying for. I don’t want to watch liberal comedy because it isn’t funny, I want real unbiased jokes that are actually funny not political and I don’t want to hear anything about the worst president this country has ever had (B. Hussein Obama)"
2018-05-31 01:57:06,"Used to work, now fails to recognize password though website does",1,Anondson,False,"The Netflix app suddenly stopped streaming and all searches failed to bring up results. I removed/reinstalled the app but an error popped up saying I had an “incorrect email or password”. So I signed into the website and my login saved in Keychain worked perfect. I returned to the app and tried signing in again and the same error, “incorrect email or password”. Recover password in the app was nonfunctional.
I signed into the website (with the password the app says is incorrect) and changed the password. Returned to the app with the new password ... guess what. “Incorrect email or password”. Guess it is hard to afford enough software QA in the Bay Area nowadays."

I had the fire stick playing in my daughters room on Netflix and Netflix playing on the Xbox in the living room and I turned off the tv in her room so I can watch tv on my phone and she can watch tv on the Xbox while she eats. It keeps saying I’m still logged in on the fire stick even though I turned off the tv, unplugged it, and took out the fire stick completly. Then I deleted Netflix and reinstalled it to try Again and I tried to turn off my phone. It’s been 40 min and it still says Its on the fire stick. No one has my account so it can’t be that. We do this every day it’s so annoying! Update this please"
2017-11-23 03:32:23,Hard to enjoy the entertainment,3,Xnxuzjsjdh,False,In version 9.46.0 the developers changed the interface so a huge pause button pops up in the middle of the screen every time the user just taps the screen. When I want to check how much time is left in a show or film I want to be able to continue my show instead of the picture being blocked by a giant pause button. Another issue I had with this app is many TV shows and films get removed after they have been very popular with many people I talk to. Other than these issues is a great app with manny great shows and movies.
2017-10-07 13:06:05,Please read this and fix it,5,Eliistocool,False,"It's is a great app and all but I don't know if I am the only one struggling with this problem but it keeps saying I can't play this title instantly and then it says try a different title I don't know why this is happening but if you guys can do an update that would be great. October 7, 2017 update I wanted to come back and say thanks for fixing the last error that occurred but now every time I want to watch Netflix it loads and then crashes

2020-10-19 11:40:20,Amazing,5,LillyLeilaNola,False,"Netflix is so good. I use the app a lot. The thing is you need to allow us to watch from more than one device. And give us more to watch!😃 I love this app and it is amazing. It’s also good for family. You should get the app!👍🏻 You should also add a teens section where the tv shows, movies and more are not kids or adult movies, but in the middle. And please don’t think I don’t like this app but its a brillance app. It allows you to watch so many different things. I love it."
2020-09-28 06:27:15,Request a movie back,5,prettyluhciara,False,Netflix is just great all alone especially with quarantine have us stuff in the house with nothing to do they brought back some great throwbacks like sister - sister and moesha and soon to be the Parker’s I would love for my favorite movie of all coraline to come back on here it’s really a great movie and teaches kids to respect their parents I’m hoping you see this but please developers bring the movie back and keep anaconda on here for a while to thats a great movie as well 💕✨
2020-09-12 20:46:49,"Netflix, are you serious?",1,Netflixyoupedo,False,"I’ve used this app for over 6 years now and it was an absolute joy. Hours upon hours of different shows and movies spread across different genres. The UI was intuitive and user friendly, the recommended usually hit right on the dime, and the movies were actually quite entertaining. But what kind of movie is Cuties and why do you think it’s okay to film underage children performing what is basically soft core porn. It is disgusting. It can’t even be played off as a “mistake” because there had to be funding for this movie, a crew for this movie, and production for this movie. This is only enjoyable to literal pedophiles and that disgusts me, this one movie completely ruined my view on Netflix."
2020-07-12 19:26:14,Terrible Usability,3,Christine Marucci Magidin,False,"While I love being able to pick up watching a movie or show wherever I left off on another device, I cannot report problems through the app. For this you have to use the website. I wanted to submit a request regarding subtitle errors, and, although I’m pretty good with technology, it seems my sights are set too high. I made the poor assumption that the app would allow me to do all the same things as the web portal, but it doesn’t. Also, I would like to be able to see where a film/show was made (geographically), as it provides contextual insight."
2020-07-06 16:12:56,Netflix,5,LlamaAlpac1,False,"Netflix is an awesome app but also I have found out when you push kids the movie Tall Girl and so I clicked on it and about close to the end there’s some inappropriate words and also other movies that are the same and that we also know that younger kids will watch stuff like that and I know there is a little kids section but you know how younger kids are very clumsy and curious so maybe don’t put as much of those movies on there please! 

Thank You!"

I also would like to suggest that they add ‘ The Big Bang Theory ‘ because there getting rid of the office which is my favorite show. I also I’m suggesting ‘ Bob’s burgers ‘ and hopefully they will add all 10 seasons and the new episodes."
2020-02-22 13:53:54,So stupid,3,KayKay_;p,False,"This app is great and I love binge watching and watching shows, but it won’t let me download movies because my stupid sister has it downloaded on her phone too so this stupid app doesn’t let me because it’s downloaded on another account’s device. And that one streaming at a time is so freakin stupid you shouldn’t need to pay to be able to watch on one device. My sister and I always have to take turns watching when all I wanna watch is Stranger Things my god. And if you have to pay for it, at LEAST make it permanent. More than 5 dollars for just a freaking month? Pathetic."
2020-04-12 05:19:45,Please consider my review for an update,5,4DLlamaAlien,False,I personally love Netflix however I am the type that needs things to be very organized. This means that whenever there’s a show that I’ve stopped watch that is still in my ‘Continue watching’ I get rlly irritated and end up deleting my profile and making a new one. I mean I can deal with it but it’s a hassle each time. Could you make a function where you can remove shows from your continued watching?

My little brother also likes watching shows on Netflix but he watches the same thing over and over again. I want there to be more seasons of what he watches and what I watch like for Motown Magic and Alexa and Katie for me. I also want there to be a lot more teen selections like Alexa and Katie as well. Other than these problems, I think Netflix is awesome and AMAZING 😉

2019-06-02 23:06:54,are you still watching? 👁👄👁,4,Almighty Emoji,False,it feels like ive watched everything good on the app but i like to use it as background noise or for the kids to watch their shows...it gets extremely annoying when the app cuts off the kids shows after a couple episodes and i have to look for my phone and connect back to netflix and look for the show all over again. Couldnt you just give us the option to turn it off?? were paying therefore of we want it to run nonstop why cant we??
2020-01-12 15:18:20,"Overall, I Like -though a few improvements would help",4,"Rockport, Maine",False,"I waited for a while before subscribing from Disney Plus for a few bugs to get worked out. Overall I am happy but there are a couple improvements I wish they would work on.

First, when trying to rewind a movie with the 10 second rewind button, it usually only works once on my iPad. I have to scroll with my finger to go back, then I also get another push of the 10 second rewind button only to repeat the scrolling... I have not tried the forward button but imagine the same problem. If that is the worse problem I have with bugs then I feel they are headed in the right direction. It is a very minor annoyance for me.

The other thing I wish was that Disney had more of their 50’s, 60’s and 70’s live films available. There are many I want to watch again and are not available yet. Hopefully, Disney will continue to add more movies every so often. Monthly would be perfect. I also wish there were more options for breaking down what movies or shows to choose from by preference. I like live filmed older family movies from 3 generations. Sometimes I would like to know more about the stars of the film and what other Disney films they were in, even if the films are not available yet. But, I imagine in time many changes and improvements will be made."
2020-08-12 13:52:46,My Honest Opinion 👀 (please read),3,avabella,False,"Disney+ is a pretty good app especially for hardcore Disney fans. But there are way too many issues for an app that you have to BUY. To begin, the volume quality is the worst for me. My hearing isn’t the best so I tend to turn the volume for things all the way up. I did this on my NEW computer, and NEW iPad and the volume was very low. The iPad volume was a bit better but still not as loud as I wanted and/or anticipated. Furthermore, it keeps recommending the same few amount of shows, movies etc. I want to be able to find new things to watch easier. Don’t get me wrong, I’m a hardcore Hamilton fan and I am pleased to see it on the main page, but everything else keeps getting recommended on and on and on. Continuing from Hamilton, this is not a necessary addition but I would like to see more musicals. It already has Hamilton and Newsies, and I enjoyed them the most out of anything on the app. But like I said this is an option and I know it’s meant for Disney things, that’s just what I want. There are a couple of more issues but I’m going to leave it on this final opinion, which is the 10 second fast forward button. Most of the time when I fast forward with the 10 second button the screen is just frozen. It happens on all of my devices and it’s quite annoying. Using the scroll bar with mostly my finger is not fun. That’s really all I have to say so I hope you, the reader take these notes into consideration. Take care!"
2020-05-07 19:15:25,Good content but the app is very buggy,3,Jordan Boisley,False,"The have a lot of great stuff in the app but the app itself has a lot of bugs. When the screen pops up that says new episode, I try to press it but it does nothing. While playing a video, you have to be careful where you touch or else it will exit out of the video even if you touched nowhere near the back button. The play button buffers. Not the video, but the button itself. There are times when I want to pause the video/movie and I can’t because I have to wait for the play button to buffers. Sometimes the app just crashes for almost no reason. I’ll be watching something like The Simpsons and the app will just crash. Don’t get me wrong, it is not a bad app, it just needs some major improvements. They do have a lot of stuff on there. I personally have watch led a lot of their classic movies and the Disney+ originals. I recommend The World According to Jeff Goldblum and High School Musical: The Musical - The Series (i am a big High School Musical fan). I think Disney just needs to make some much needed changes to the app and fix all of the current issues. Also, in my opinion, they should add some of the ABC shows like Once Upon a Time or Blackish or Marvel’s Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. They should also make certain shows like The Simpsons the original aspect ratio. With certain older shows and movies, you miss some key details showing it in a 16:9 aspect ratio rather a 4:3 aspect ratio."
2020-09-19 19:25:26,Great content.  App interface needs work,4,=emuJuice=,False,"My entire family has been enjoying the variety of great content.  The service has also been steady and reliable for us, with only one or two glitches over a few months now.  However, the app/ Apple TV interface could use some improvement...

My kids are young enough that I don't really want them to have complete access.  Its great that they can have their own profiles with limits, but if it exists I've yet to find a way to prevent them from just using my profile.  (We mostly steam via Apple TV in case it differs)

Further, there is little to no useful history.  Yes the continue watching was tweaked, but it is still far from enough.  How hard world it be to provide a simple list with thumbnails of everything a profile has watched and when, preferably sortable but at least in reverse chronological order?  (As a software developer that's rhetorical.  Its easy!)  That would let me monitor kids use of my profile (until it's protected as it should be) as well as see what they're watching in their own profiles.  It also should not be hard to add a watched count and last watched on date to any show I go to the details of, and a progress bar for anything partially watched.  This is basic stuff  that should already be in your database.  Let me see it too please!"
2019-11-13 21:30:24,One major thing missing & Please don’t change movies!,4,troicole,False,"I love how they have ALL the Disney Chanel Originals which was the biggest thing I was wanting. I’ve only been exploring for a little while but it has sooo much. 
  I am frustrated with not having a “currently watching” list though, that is a pretty necessary thing when I stop watching for a bit I don’t want to have to re-search for my show. That is the only reason it is not 5 stars.
  One last thing is I’ve read that some older movies may be censored due to racial or ethnic jokes/slurs or whatever. I really hope they DO NOT do this because that is not only changing beloved movies and shows it is an attempt to alter history. Whether it is approved of or not in today’s society it is a fact that people thought differently in former years and it shows in how they made everything from film to art to books. If there is concern on how it will affect today’s children then it should be seen as a conversation point not something to remove, and if it offends adults then they have the right not to watch it same as we all do for anything. If censoring must be done then make it optional so that those who want to watch the shows in their entirety can freely do so.
  Having a commentary or intro series for each explaining the societal and cultural environment of the time would be welcome"
2020-01-30 02:10:37,"Decent app, security not so great",3,Michellee_007,False,"My issues with Disney+ was that my account got hacked, the password was changed and I changed it again after realizing it was hacked. However, THE EMAIL WAS CHANGED TOO! WITHOUT ME EVEN KNOWING! How that was possible, I don't know. After calling customer service and being on the phone the first time, we changed the email and password, only to find out by the first not helpful representative, that they don't give the option to sign everyone out even though you are the administrator of the account, so changing everything was pointless. He basically states that the people who hacked the account will still have access even though I changed all of the login information. I was ready to quit the whole Disney+ until I called customer service again the following day and spoke to Shay, her kindness and helpfulness convinced me to stay with Disney+. She revoked the account immediately and then helped me make a new account. One thing that should be added is better security. For someone to take over my account so easily and change the email and password was a horrible experience. Another thing that should be added is being able to log everyone out as an administrator of the account. The app is decent because of the shows it offers, I do not encounter any buffering and so on; however, the security and privacy isn't that great. ."
2019-11-27 00:57:54,Getting better,4,chr1scastl3,False,"Addendum: They added a  continue watching and a recommended for you. Increased to 4 stars, now just waiting for new content to see how it goes.

I got this app for the bew star wars stuff coming out which is awesome. And it has things from the vault, old cartoons. It has sub sections: star wars/disney/marvel etc. that being said. Theirs things to work on. Theirs no continue watching, you need to either add it to your current watch to the watchlist or search every time. And it wont always remember where you left off especially for shows itll just replay ep 1 however i havent had this issue with movies, it remembers my place most times. It freezes often requiring you to close and reopen the app(ps4) havent had freeze issues on tablet. Itll also freeze and then go back a minute replaying things as it tries to correct itself. The current library is very limited to older disney movies. As i believe other streaming oroviders have current contracts for certain movies they prolly wont be able to add them to disney+ till other hulu/netflix movies are done with their contracts example is a limited marvel movie selection. They have plans to add more shows/movies so i think itll be like netflix where they add and remove shows and movies. When its less buggy I’ll prolly give it 4-5 stars at that time."
2019-11-15 15:57:07,Absolutely love it!!!,5,JJ1989$,False,"I LOVE this app and have really enjoyed introducing my kiddos to all of the classics! I feel like I am a kid again and am in 7th heaven when I come home and ALL of the Disney movies are just waiting for me! My kids love it and everyone has a new favorite show. All of our other streaming services have officially been forgotten so thank you Disney for saving my hard earned money and for putting all of the most amazing movies in one place!!

Please do not remove older shows due to older views and fear of offending people. I love all Disney movies and appreciate them for what they were and acknowledge that views have drastically changed over the decades. Some items may be offensive, even to me as a African American woman but as so many other have pointed out these are better used as talking points for our children. We cannot alway run from the offensive history that we have, it happened, and it is better to learn from it than pretend like it has always been perfect (which it is far from perfect today).

Also, I really hope we can an area that shows what we are “currently watching” and when I open up the movie it could have the bar that shows how much was completed. I know we have a “watchlist” but it doesn’t help having to search each time."
2020-09-03 23:00:55,What I love most about Disney +!,5,NagolCraft 2,False,"“I Love how Disney + has all of the Star Wars movies, TV shows.  I also love how Disney + has almost every Marvel movie, and I hope they are all on there someday!  I also really like that Disney+ has all of the Disney TV shows, from the 90s, and all the way too 2020!! However, and I’m sure that you know this, but I hope that Disney + get the movies, The Incredible Hulk, Spiderman 
Homecoming, and I’m pretty sure that Disney+ will add Spiderman Far From Home, Dog With a Blog, and anything Else do you have yet to add.  Oh, and how could I forget that the first thing I thought of when I heard of Disney+ was, I really hope that there are no adds, or commercials like, the app Disney Now, and I am glad that there aren’t any.  I’m also looking forward to more movies, and shows, that Disney+ will create in the future.  I think you’re doing a great job with all of your Disney+ originals, and I can’t wait for more.  I also like how Disney+ is only $6,99 per week!  Even thorough I got it for free, for an entire year, through Verizon.  I’m also shocked that a streaming service like Disney+ would ever be created, but I’m so glad it was, and I couldn’t ask for anything better, then, Disney +!  And this show’s every reason that I rated Disney +, five stars!”"
2020-07-07 20:13:46,Amazing! But a few things,4,YassQueenzzz,False,"I wrote a review a couple months ago and they fixed things! The app was missing a couple tv shows but we’re making progress as far as getting them on Disney plus. Slowly but surely 😊! A couple problems I have is sometimes when I reload the app it won’t keep my place in the episode and I’ll have to reload a couple times to get it back to where I was. Also sometimes for no reason I can’t see the episode clearly. 😫 I really want to enjoy my sitcoms with no problems whatsoever. And there is one major problem that is getting on my nerves. Some of the shows I watch it’s incredibly obvious that the episodes are out of order. For example in Kickin’ it one of my favorite tv shows almost every episode in season two is out of order and a few of the episodes in season 3 and 4 of Kickin’ it are also out of order. I don’t know if this is a problem with just my device or if multiple people are having this problem but it is very aggravating. And it’s not just Kickin’ it I’m having this problem with a lot of other shows. For example it’s also a problem with Shake It Up, Austin and Ally, Bizaardvark, and Lab Rats. If it’s possible I really hope you can fix this about the app. Other than that totally love it!!! ❤️"
2020-02-16 06:10:05,Nice content but needed update...,3,Irwinhoodler,False,"this review is more geared towards the developers...I love and appreciate all of the disney content on this app but the app seems to only push specific series and not any that are tailored for my experience. It would be much better to see suggested series or movies instead of the same few disney originals that Disney wants to push so often. It makes it kind of hard to see or consider watching all of the content that is on this app unless I specifically search for a title to watch on my own. Along with this, I have had the same problem with this app since the day that I’ve downloaded it and i’m hoping this bug gets fixed soon...Every time I press the reverse/forwards 10 second button the movie will reverse/forwards to where it needs to be, but the loading animation would stay on the screen. The problem with this is that it prevents me from pausing or reversing/forwarding any other time after this one time because the loading animation would still be on the screen if I attempt to do so. The buttons do not reappear. It doesn’t obstruct the view of the streaming media and it’s only there when I tap to attempt to pause but it prevents me from taking any other action after i’ve done it once before. I hope mentioning these things has been helpful and I look forward to this bug being fixed soon."
2019-12-09 22:32:01,"Good content, lots of problems!",4,TallyProf,False,"I use Disney plus all the time to watch all of my favorite Disney shows and movies. There are a lot of problems that will HAVE to be figured out! But the one that upsets me the most, actually two or more: one; if I switch devices it will often forget where I was in an episode and restart it from the beginning forcing me to skip to where I left off. Also unlike a lot of other streaming platforms, there is no PROGRESS BAR per episode, to show how far you have watched through an episode. If you open the show it will not automatically place you in the season you are watching, you have to go and choose season and scroll to the correct one. On the mobile app there is no way to view episodes if you click on the resume watching box, unlike a lot of other platforms! My mobile device will also often not automatically play the next episode, when I was a kid I dreamed of the day it would automatically play the next episode and guess what everyone else has figured it out! I like the blue circle around the play button about 5 seconds, but it is often not there! So frustrating! I like the idea and content but the curtain should have been held as we say in show business, before release!"
2020-02-20 06:47:33,ADD MORE CONTENT !!!!!!!!!!!!!,3,pig pie🐥🐎🐌,False,"There is a lot of great old shows and movies and some new stuff but I would really appreciate it if you would add more new stuff like Gabby Duran And the Unsitibles, Bunk’d, and The Owl house. I think these are shows that the targeted audience of Disney plus like to watch. DisneyNOW has all these shows but sometimes there isn’t the full season of shows that are slightly older and it never works very well. I love that you have National Geographic shows on it because I cant really watch those any where else except for the National Geographic channel and a few on Netflix. I really enjoy watching the shows that you do have and I would really appreciate if you would add more Disney Channel shows. Please tell me why you do what you advertise and don’t let me watch all the Disney shows. I got Disney plus because DisneyNOW didn’t have very much content of shows that I didn’t watch very much but Disney plus doesn’t have most of the shows I do watch and now I have nowhere to watch Disney shows because it is almost impossible to get DisneyNOW to work and it is even harder to find Disney shows on the internet. I am begged you to PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE add more Disney Channle content. It would be really appreciated by me and a lot of other people my age. Also please   make the internet on DisneyNOW work, it is driving me CRAZY!!!!!!!"
2020-09-04 16:10:31,My Heart is Broke,4,megleawalker,False,I know Mulan was probably a expensive movie to put together but I already have Premier Access so why do I have to pay for the exact same thing just to watch one movie? I know you guys still have to make money during the pandemic but I’m not gonna pay 30$ just to watch one movie and your probably gonna do this again and make everyone who had payed 30$ for Mulan pay an extra 30$ to watch another movie. I was so excited to watch Mulan because I had Premier Access and I didn’t understand that I had to pay for it twice because the wording of it was weird all I understood was “Avaliable with Premier Access” I asked my mom if we had Premier Access and she said yes. I waited until MIDNIGHT to see if I could watch it and when I saw I couldn’t I nearly broke down in tears. No joke. I searched when it would be available and it turns out I have to wait an extra 3 months before getting to watch it. December 4 is a long way off and with school starting it’s gonna take even longer. The more bored you are at school the longer the year is gonna take. Which means by the time It’s December 4 I’m probably gonna forget this movie exists and I’m gonna go on to Disney+ and be saying to myself “I’ll watch it later”.
2019-11-17 21:06:56,Forget Netflix,5,chelsmystique,False,"Just kidding.. but really Disney+ may be a competitor to Netflix but since I started my free trial & now Verizon promotion subscription - my family & I have been watching Disney+ non-stop. Of course being that this is a new app there are some small bugs but nothing that isn’t going to deter a Disney fan from loving this app anyway! Some of the movies listed aren’t available until certain dates like January 1, 2020 or sometime in April but it’s not all of the movies and I think for the most part most the hit movies are available to watch. It would be nice to have an open platform with all the movies available but you know what? For only $6.99 a month you can’t beat that. Thank you Disney for being a millennial-friendly subscription - all your movies especially Pixar have grown with my generation in mind. We appreciate you! If you have a Verizon unlimited plan definitely enroll in the Disney+ promotion it is so worth it not only for those of you who have children but sometimes us adults need some Disney magic in our lives as well - pretty sure Walt Disney himself said something of that sort at one point. Don’t come for me if he didn’t but I’m pretty sure he did :)"
2019-11-24 02:40:58,Great app but...,4,Hey-Gir,False,"Here is the thing, I love Disney, my family loves Disney. Everyone young and old loves Disney. I think it’s an amazing app, with some even better features, and yes it has a bunch of glitches (which I’m not stressing about because in time those would be fixed), there are some things missing, (again could be fixed in the future, maybe something’s just need to be developed better, whatever the case may be). Those things don’t bother me. This is what I don’t like...,,

...The majority of the people who’ll be using this app are people who aren’t tech savvy or children. They aren’t always using the most up to date device or software, some children that are using Disney plus (which o can attest to) are children using gen 3 iPads. Or iPhone 4s. Things that are Easy in the hands of children. But unfortunately the app doesn’t support those devices, as they are too old for use. 

It would be fantastic if it was, I think they would have a lot more viewership but at this rate it’s very hard to use such a wonderful app on such an old  device. I mean Netflix does work on things that old. Disney please consider this. Not everyone can or will upgrade a child’s device just so they can watch Disney movies."
2020-01-15 20:38:35,Love hate relationship,1,ian is on time,False,"First off I love all the amazing movies from the past and The Mandalorian Is soooo good!  But recently the customer service has been sub par. On all my devices, as of two days ago after the few months it has been working fine is no longer working when on my home Wifi. Restarted router, uninstall reinstall all apps and support says it’s a WiFi issue. To test that theory I wold start a vid on data then quickly switch to WiFi and it works fine... I would even Fast forward/rewind pause and play to make sure it wasn’t just saved buffer and it all worked just fine. When I would exit out and try to resume the vid it then gave me an error message saying not able to connect... all customer service continues to do is say it is something on my and even after stating the facts then has yet to respond or give any details even requested a call back they said some one would respond in 10 days... My computer  can stream just fine when on WiFi when I stream through there website so this is another indicator this is an app issue but no one wants to look into it or address this it seams. If they would make more of an effort I would not write this review. 100 some bucks isn’t a big deal for a year but it’s the principle of lack of accountability and assistance. A few other friends scattered around my town and local towns have had the same issue..."
2020-01-03 23:14:20,I’m so happy my fam got this! But...,4,The iPad Queen,False,"So my family has gotten this and it is a great app! But the only thing is a minor bug. So I was bringing our iPad on a car trip, and before we went, I downloaded some episodes of my favorite Disney TV show so I could watch them offline in the car, and I stared watching them on the way to our carpool mates, and I noticed that it wasn’t as smooth as it was supposed to be... So I just thought, “Oh, this happens all the time with Netflix, so it shouldn’t be a big deal with this. I can fix it later.” So we dropped the iPad off at our house, and a few hours later, we came home, and I started to watch some more of the show, and it was still... Grainy, if you know what I mean? So I went to my dad and asked if he could fix it, but he didn’t know how, so I tried restarting the app, but it wasn’t smooth still. I tried restarting the whole iPad, but it still wouldn’t fix. So I finally figured that if I delete the app and then get it back again, it would be fixed. And we signed in again, and it worked that time... Quite an annoying situation, but it was... Kind of an “ easy” fix, but maybe you guys could fix this problem for an update.
Thank you for your time!

2019-11-18 04:30:44,Stop being stupid people just enjoy the app.,5,qwbtr123,False,"The app is perfect, but these crazy reviewers are the boneheads ..look people right now there is no feature of “what I watched last “ or history the app would slow down you want that go back to netflix and stay there. 
Just because you can add 7 people to your account is does not always mean you should. You really trust those 7 people with your account info? Remember only 4 streams allowed and You have should known that you have to have control over these devices. If your password gets changed it will be your fault deal with it. Then you free phone deal will not matter at all. The movies could and will edited if Disney sees fit you should have know this. 4.3 ? No no no 
5.5 and nothing else . The app engine is pure and clean cues up easy , logo guides are clear to understand and easy find. Pick Your items then play them from the largest Disney library of gems no worries 🎥🎧🎬

Do do you ever wanna watch Disney movies or tv stows but you don’t know what do you want to watch or do you ever want options between Star Wars or Marvel? If you have that problem then I have a solution for you get Disney+! I have Disney+ and I love it! One reason why I love it is because I can have it on my tv iPod, iPad, or  phone. Also if my sister is watching tv and I want to watch Disney+ then I can go on my iPad and watch. It’s awesome!! Another reason why I love  Disney+ is because I can choose from so many different Disney movies or tv shows. Also I can watch all shows like Hannah Montana. Here’s one more reason why Disney+ is awesome.  The quality is excellent! It’s super cheap and it’s so great. What I mean is there’s so many movies and TV shows I can watch and it’s not a lot of money. I can watch a new Marvel movie without going to the store and paying for that movie to buy it. I Disney+ I can just watch it and there’s more options! I can just watch the movie the fort so I remember and then watch that new movie so I can remember what happened before! Thanks for reading this and I hope you love Disney+ like me."
2019-11-13 03:17:08,Over all great but could use some fixes,4,Delia_99,False,"Overall I love Disney plus. There are so many shows/movies to select from that it’s hard for a Disney lover to decide where to start. Since today was launch day I know there will be some kinks that need to be worked out. I just wanted to list some issues or recommendations that could/should possibly be addressed in a future update. I saw one review mention that stuff they were adding to their watchlist wasn’t saving. I ran into that same issue. Another issue I ran into was my auto play wasn’t working. I have that setting turned on but when watching a series it does not automatically play the next episode. I also noticed that an episode was missing from season 1 of the little mermaid series. My recommendations for possible updates are: (1) add a “continue watching” section that shows what I was last watching and didn’t finish. (2)when watching a series have the episodes that users have watched marked in some way that shows they’ve been watched. Currently having to remember what episode I left off on. (3) maybe add a DCOM section so all those are in one place. Overall, I love Disney+ and I’m so excited to keep streaming all my Disney favorites"
2019-12-08 15:55:33,"Truly wonderful, but needs a few adjustments.",4,zxcdfyhvbjkn,False,"I absolutely love Disney+ it has brought me back to my childhood and that’s a wonderful thing to give to the world right now. All the Disney channel originals i could never find anywhere else is all right here and it makes my heart so full of happiness and nostalgia. But there’s a few issues as others have said. First, why does it have the second movie and not the first one for some titles not all but I have been noticing it with a few movies. Like with National Treasure for example, the first one’s not  coming out till April 2020 what was the thought process there?! Second, when you go to rewind a movie with the touch screen in your phone it’s not accurate at all. I’ll go to a certain time take my finger off gently i might add and then it either jumps way ahead or behind of what I actually chose. Third, like others said the continued watching section is terrible why do i have to go back and search for where i was on some movies I’ve never seen, that’s just asking for spoilers just like the rewinding situation. I think with some adjustments you have yourself a truly fantastic app and a gift to the world. Thank you. 🤍"
2019-11-21 17:22:37,It needs some work,3,Shellamon,False,"It’s cool that it has older tv shows that I  grew up watching, no doubt I love that!, however it doesn’t resume my tv shows, I often times have to look for the exact one I left off at. It’s really annoying. (Especially when you have a crying child!) It also needs the “you just watched this” feature right up front so I don’t have to go searching for it. When I get on to Disney plus it’s always the same movies.. and I’m not interested in those. I want to see only what I’m interested in. That’s the reason why I bought it. Another feature it needs is. “Because you watched this, we suggest you watch that” I’m getting bored of the same things, nothing new is on there. Well not that I know of.... another suggestion that you also separate the “coming soon” movies from the other ones. People can get excited about the up coming year, instead of being supper bummed when they see they have to wait till the month of November in the year 2020 to see the movie or tv shows. I was really upset when I realized I couldn’t watch what I wanted till next Christmas. I’m not to excited about this any more. It’s not a good set up. I feel i was conned out of my money. I bought the year subscription and I wish I hadn’t."
2020-04-27 17:22:37,Great service bad app,2,gjygbb,False,As a streaming service Disney plus is very good but as an app it is bad. This is not a review of the service but a review of the app. One of my points for Disney plus being a bad app is that it crashes randomly and will not open for a bit after it crashes. Recently my power went out and since I had a lot of stuff downloaded on Disney plus I thought I would watch that until my power got back on. But when I opened the app it went to a dark blue screen and then crashed I tried again but the same happened. Then I tried to restart my iPad and try again. When I opened up Disney plus after I restarted my iPad the same thing happened. So instead of using Disney plus I had to use Netflix. When my power got back on I had to delete Disney plus and redownload almost 100GB of shows and movies. The reason I’m writing this is because just now a few days after I I redownloaded Disney plus and all my shows and movies the same thing is happening I thought it would be solved with the new update but no. I have not found any way to stop this and I am very mad. Disney plus needs to put more work into there app and it’s quality control. If anyone from Disney plus is reading this please help me and thank you to every one who has read this.
2019-11-14 02:45:58,Update Suggestions,4,Ashd81019,False,"So our family of Disney-lovers find Disney+ to be everything we wanted it to be! Can’t wait for more of the original content to be released, also! 

I just have a minor suggestion for a future update that would make things a lot easier for us (and I’m sure others). Our son LOVES to watch the Mickey & Friends shorts. So much so, that we re-watch them constantly. However, after an episode is over and it’s continued to auto-play, if we go back to a previously played episode, it stars playing at the credits. There is no “play from the beginning button”. That leaves me scrambling to manually hold down the rewind button. Now it’s not so bad to have to rewind something, but the real problem is once that episode that I rewound is over, it will auto play the next episode and (because it was previously viewed) starts playing that from the credits again! It’s extremely frustrating considering the episodes are only 3-4 minutes long. On the Disney Now app, if the episodes were played to completion, any rewatches go back to the beginning. PLEASE MAKE THIS A FUTURE UPDATE! I fear my sanity and productivity are in jeopardy until this is fixed."
2019-11-28 08:07:20,"Great Service, Missing One Key Feature",4,Caseyguse,True,"My wife and kids and I love the service so far! There’s tons of stuff for everyone to watch and we’re enjoying showing them the classic movies we watched as kids. The app works quite much better now that they’ve squashed some bugs and added the all important continue watching feature. 

The app is still not perfect however. After using the app more, I’ve noticed some peculiarities that don’t make much sense. The first is that when someone watches something on their profile, it will often show up on the continue watching list on my profile even though I’ve never watched that show on my profile. This happens quite often with my son’s episodes of Mickey Mouse Clubhouse. The other weird thing I’ve run into is that Moana can not be found on a child’s profile. This means my 5 year old who loves Moana must have an adult account that is more difficult for her to navigate in order to watch her favorite movie on the service. 

Overall, we’re very happy both with the service and the app. Once a few minor tweaks are made, I think Disney+ will be able to play ball with the big dogs."
2020-05-29 03:49:14,Charged twice,1,Julieta Conte,False,"I have been charged twice for the same account since December of 2019. One payment is being withdrawn from Apple and the other from Google Play which never has my information on the first place(with different billing dates), I repeat, FOR THE SAME DISNEY+ ACCOUNT. I called Disney+ to get an answer and they kept telling me that it wasn’t their problem and that SOMEHOW Google got my information (email and credit card number) and that even though they were accepting two different payments methods FOR THE SAME EXACT ACCOUNT, they couldn’t do anything. That I had to call Google Play and tell them that I was being charged from Apple too and ask them for my money back. I called Google and they told me that my report for a refund didn’t meet their policy and that for them, this one was the only payment method for the Disney+ and that I needed to call Disney+ (which I already did but they kept tossing the ball to Google or Apple). Then I called Apple and guess what... THEY SAID THE SAME THING, that they are not connected to Google Play and they cannot give me a refund. I don’t know what else to do, I realized that this happened to so many people and they still don’t have an answer. Disney+ is authorizing payments from two different sites for the same service/account and not doing anything to solve the problem."
2019-12-18 21:05:17,Fixed the Bug so YAY,5,abby_b247,False,"OLD REVIEW:
So, I gave this four stars because I do love the app and would love to give it five stars if only this one problem would be fixed. I was initially annoyed about the no “continue watching” feature but with the update that fixed my problem. Or so I thought... when I first got the continue watching update it worked on all of my devices. Unfortunately, now- no matter what device I am on- it restarts the episode that I was on. The continue watching will show me my show and say 7 mins remaining, or something like that, but when I click on it it will load to the beginning of that episode. 
This is not the worst because I will fast forward to where I was, but I do feel it is an inconvenience and would love for it get fixed. Again I would like to emphasize my love for this app and getting to rewatch all of my favorite Disney shows and movies. Please fix this little bug so I can change my review to five stars.
NEW REVIEW:
I love the app and have changed my review to five stars because the bug mentioned above was fixed. Thank you Disney+ this app is amazing."
2019-11-28 19:41:38,Love it but 1 issue,4,Ckcb0704,False,"I love this app and have had it for a little while now. All my favorite Disney channel original movies in one place, talk about a childhood dream come true! 
The only issue I have had that doesn’t seem to have been addressed in the update, is that my watchlist isn’t working right. Currently, it’s missing some shows and movies that I can look up and see that I’ve added to my watchlist already, though it’s not showing up when I open the watchlist. 
The watchlist is also duplicating the items that do show up on the list. I’m not sure if this is connected to the other problem I noted above or if it is a completely different issue. 
Obviously, I still love the app and have even recommended it to a few people. I just wanted to mention this issue that I am having as the other reviews I have read didn’t seem to mention this.  I hope this is an easy fix, as I do think this app is great.
Disney as a company is amazing! I am so grateful that I can watch all the movies and shows I love that are more recent, while also having the option to revisit some old favorites that I grew up watching (and loving)."
2020-01-25 05:10:23,Surprised,2,beebo11,False,"Update: So somehow as you watch content it is saved into documents and data. I have no content downloaded within the app but somehow over 6GB of documents and data?? Also it shows multiple episodes downloaded in the storage setting view of the iPhone that aren’t downloaded within the Disney plus app itself. After deleting those episodes that aren’t downloaded but somehow are, there was still over 590MB of documents and data. I deleted and reinstalled the app and it had mere kb of data. As I start watching content again, the documents and data keeps increasing, what gives? I have tons of other streaming apps that don’t do this, it’s a major hassle, please fix!

Original review:Lots of things already available. The menus and selection content loads quickly and the playback quality is very good. Also tried it on the Roku and it also looks way better than every other streaming app I have. Things load and begin to play quickly. They have a search function but they also have multiple ways of categorizing so you can get to what you want pretty quickly as well. So far it’s working and looking great, have to see how it does when millions of people are using it at the same time."
2020-01-03 04:12:51,"Nice service, app needs work",3,Strider1882,False,"We (obviously) enjoy a bunch of the Disney content, and even some of the “original” content (like The Mandalorian) is very well done. However, the app itself leaves a lot to be desired. My two main complaints are:

1. The app always begins playing a show immediately with no buffering, but then, at exactly 20 seconds in, buffers for 5-10 seconds. This is extremely annoying, especially when you’re watching a Pixar short that is only two minutes long. Also, since the update, the app has begun buffering randomly in the middle of programs, sometimes 2-3 times in a row. For reference, we also have Netflix and Britbox, and neither one EVER stops the show at any point to buffer.

2. The lack of a working “continue watching” bar. I know that this bar showed up in the update, but it doesn’t work on either of our devices. The bar is there; it shows the programs we’ve been watching, and how far we’ve progressed into them. But when I tap on one of the programs in the bar, it nearly always restarts the program from the beginning. About once in ten times, it will restart from where we stopped watching, but those aren’t good odds."
2019-11-18 04:15:53,One little thing,4,Boones Farm,False,"Alright, so this is going to be short and sweet. Disney plus is amazing, I use it all the time to watch my favorite movies, and recently I’ve been binge watching the marvel movies. It works out pretty well for me. New episodes come out within a few days (which is pretty awesome), you get to watch anything owned by Disney, and it’s just awesome. (Especially The Mandalorian) But there is one thing that could make it better, and I’ve seen other people make this suggestion too. Disney plus should definitely have a “currently watching” section. It’s the one thing left that I need. Otherwise I have to look up the movie that I’m watching, find the right one, and hope it starts off where I ended. And it does, but I think it’d take a little less time and effort if you put a currently watching section right on the top bar of your home screen. That way I can click the app, scroll down a tiny, tiny little bit, and click the movie or show that I’m watching. So yeah, my suggestion (which you should totally add) would be a currently watching section. Otherwise, Disney plus is basically perfect for me."
2019-11-17 16:57:20,Almost complete,4,Grand Wizard Theodore,False,"The service is off the a great start and I have no doubt that Disney will continue to add more movies, shows, and shorts as it continues. However, while there is a lot of stuff in the service at launch, much of it feels like filler material and some of the things not included can felt. Such as not a single Indiana Jones movie, or the fact that Disney now owns all of Fox’s catalog but only include the Simpsons and avatar. No alien or fox X-men movie? 

I know these will probably be added later on but I feel like a streaming service that wants to truly compete with other platforms like Netflix should have many of these films already included to form an unbeatable backbone and then continue to support the platform with original content and other  new releases after their run in movie theaters. Otherwise you get what we have now, which is a service that has a couple of main classics here and there, and a few originals, but is mostly made up of Disney channel original content and lots of live action D-list filler movies that only someone who grew up with would enjoy watching for nostalgic reasons."
2020-01-05 01:54:14,TV shows out of order,3,gatorbryce,False,"For what I use the app for it works fantastic.  I have noticed updates being rolled out and see the changes happen which is fantastic. The biggest con I have is the older tv shows are out of order. Watched the new Ducktales and Talespin and the first 2-3 episodes for each are hidden randomly throughout the run.  I know it’s a cartoon but it is nostalgic and watching it as an adult and wanting to know why certain things happened would be nice to know at the beginning.  Other complaints would be stretching the old Simpsons 4:3 into 16:9. The old Disney cartoons are 4:3 so why not the old Simpsons?  The app works well with chromecast. Every now and then the programming will stop playing whether it’s 2 episodes in or 8. It’ll randomly stop.  They need to add skip intros to all tv shows like The Mandalorian has.  I look forward to the future of this streaming service and can’t wait for the whole MCU to be available. Also, please add more classic Mickey Mouse programming as big blocks. Not individual 6 minutes episodes. I have to search for and stream one at a time. Fix these issues I have pointed out and this will be in my eyes a five star app."
2020-02-15 19:18:01,BLUE SPIRAL OF SLOW and bugs...please fix,2,ElDough,False,"Have a 150+ Mbps internet connection and think Disney + should work fine when you pay for it?  Yeah, me too.  However, the app is buffering nearly all the time and sometimes stops in the middle of shows to show the “BLUE SPIRAL OF SLOW” as the app attempts to catch up.  I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling, closing and restarting the app and device more times than we care to keep track of, checking for updates and...oh yes, I would think a minimum 150 Mbps download should be adequate for an app that requires 5 and 25 Mbps for HD and 4K playback, respectively, but who knows?  Also, as an added insult, try using the forward or backward playback arrow just once in the app to skip ahead or back a few seconds and you will incur the wrath of the blue spiral for the rest of the episode that you happen to be watching.  I might expect such problems from lesser apps, but naively thought Disney would have fixed them early on...and yet here we are.   I have asked before (to no avail) and shall ask again...please fix the problems!  You get 2 stars because the content is and would be nice to watch, but the bugs in your app for both iPhone and iPad make it difficult to enjoy."
2020-07-22 21:10:18,"Content is mostly what you expect, UI is dreadful",3,CRShelton,False,"It’s pretty clear they are hoping to coast on the popularity of the brand, and it will probably work. My kid likes Disney enough that I’m willing to jump through the hoops. 

Still, there is a ton of stuff that is not available because of prior licensing agreements, which is extremely frustrating when the only thing the service has going for it is the promise of a comprehensive repository. They definitely should have waited until they had reclaimed all their content, or offered an extra service where they handle explaining the intersection of greed and intellectual property to my crying toddler who just wants to watch Tinkerbell.

As an app, it does a fine job of providing the underwhelming experience it’s tasked with, so I didn’t knock off all the stars. The service itself has been very slow to catch up to the basic experience other streaming options offer. Overall the whole service and app feel like they were rushed out in beta and are only now beginning to resemble a finished product, which is disappointing from a company that has all the resources it needs to do things right."
2020-02-07 21:44:32,To good to be true!!❤️❤️,5,#Jesusisking.nataleerose,False,"I’m obsessed!! I love Disney+ because it has everything! Like i remember on Netflix i would be watching girl meets world and then before i even finished watching the series they took it off the app and i was just like REALLY YOU'VE GOTTA BE KIDDING ME 😡 so then i downloaded DisneyNOW and i would watch an episode of something but then have to wait like 2 weeks to see the next one and it wouldn’t even go in order! I was like JUST PUT SOME STUFF ON THERE PEOPLE COME ON!! So i just deleted both and then Disney+ come out and i was like HALLELUJAH!! One thing i will say is there is a lot of glitching like when I’m watching the show will stop and pause randomly and then you have to push the button twice. Also when i turn my tablet around it will turn the screen but instead of like turning sideways it goes into the corner, i don’t think that made any since like AT ALL lol 😆. (Im tryin here lol 😝). Other than that this is just amazing i love it so so soooooooo much!Thank you guys so much for this you are such a blessing!! Thanks a million! God bless!!🙂🥰"
2019-12-01 23:32:48,Horribly optimized app,2,Rip8810,False,"Getting two stars because of this app missing the simplest streaming features out there across all devices. Not being able to easily resume a movie/show gets beyond irritating. Especially when they release a resume feature couple weeks after launch only to find out it’s broken, you have to manually search through the app each time to find what you were watching; find it, hit resume and it simply restarts. Thought it was my device messing up, but same happens on mobile, pc, fire stick and playstation. Don’t understand how such a big company that claims to be the new kings of streaming can’t even manage to have the simplest features work. Playbacks constantly skip where the video freezes and the audio continues. This can last 5-10 seconds, goes in a loading loop and then rewinds back to the spot before it hit the video freeze. This has also been happening since launch and happens quite often. Overall it’s a pretty crappy app that was rushed and never optimized for common use. Great selection but unless you want to deal with a headache trying to watch what you want, i’d wait till Disney decides to fix this app as it feels like a Beta testing."
2020-09-17 02:29:35,Disney+ is Okay.,3,Angry Elephent,False,"Disney plus is an app you have to buy, for an app you have to buy it has some low points. To start with is the thing that I hate the most. You can’t use the Disney+ app when it needs an update. Disney+ takes up sooooo much storage already and when it needs an update you have to wait until you have enough storage on your device! I also had to keep the Disney Now app just so I could watch new episodes of currently airing shows which is REALLY annoying and takes up more of my storage. I also hate the fact that a few shows, like Andi Mack, don’t have the entire season! It’s like starting a movie and skipping an entire hour of it! It is also quite annoying that there are the 1st and/or 2nd movie in a three movie series on Disney+. I watched the first mighty ducks but the second and third one are not on Disney+. I do however like the fact that they have all the original Disney movies that you have to buy on your regular TV. This is a good app for someone who is into only the older Disney movies and shows. However, it can be quite annoying for someone like me who likes old and new Disney shows and movies."
2019-11-16 18:13:10,"It’s a very nice app, but still need some work",4,Lminiclip1997,False,"I have an account and like I didn’t want to be selfish so I let my friends come on it since you can add up to 7 people. The thing is, what if one day I decided I don’t want them on it anymore but they refuse to leave. I can’t do anything abt it except cancel the subscription but then everyone else would be effected by just one person . The owner should be able to have more control. Like the owner can do stuff with other profiles and manage stuff more and ppl who aren’t the owner of it shouldn’t be able to like change or go on other ppls profile unless allowed or something. Like you can go on the owners profile even if your not the owner. The last thing is, I trust my friends so I gave them the password to it so they can login but what if for some reason(I doubt the ppl that are on my account would do this bc they are my closest friends) but one day they could just decided to change the password because even if your not the owner of the account, you can still change the password which isn’t right.

When they brought this up I was like it’s not like they’ll have Snow White or Crash and Bernstein! But when got the app this morning...🤯! SOMUCH CONTENT! Basically my whole childhood, my siblings childhood, my parents childhood, my Grandparents childhood, and Even my great grandparents childhood! I mean Starting off with Disney! So many TV Shows I can’t find anywhere! So many movies! So many series! And way to many things to even count! Marvel has the OG X-Men y’all! I mean I’m not even kidding! We have some Star Wars! With CLONE WARS!!!!!! And they got some FOX OG’S! Including AVATAR,HOME ALONE, NIGHT AT THE MUSEUM, THE SIMPSONS, THE SOUND OF MUSIC AND MORE!!!! Take my advice and get it plz y’all! If you don’t like these and like documentaries😒... they got those too with... National Geographic? I’m being honest I don’t really like Nat Geo but HEY THEY STILL GOT IT! But being honest there is some technical difficulties Disney is having so if it says “No Connection” just exit and re-enter it’s no big deal! So take my advise and get this!"
2020-03-22 20:57:59,Love but frustrating,3,searhal34lo,False,"I love Disney plus, has great movies but I’ve been using it more recently and getting more frustrated with playback issues. I watch on my PS4 but also on my iPhone as well. There are several things that are continuing to happen that make it harder and harder to enjoy movies... 1. When I try to rewind it, the picture freezes, but the sound keeps going until it catches up with the visual, which is frustrating cause I continuously have to rewind. 2. Sometimes while viewing, the picture will freeze and sound goes ahead but then the video rushes through the scenes to catch back up with the sound. 3. Other times while viewing, the picture freezes, the sound goes on, and then the sound rewinds further back until it matches the picture. Very frustrating when I’m trying to enjoy a movie. 4. I also very often get logged out out of my account which makes me log back in every other day if not every day. 5. When finishing my movie and trying to go back to home it freezes and everything is just a grey screen. So I constantly have to shut down the app and open it back up."
2019-11-14 16:54:25,App needs work,3,Reliant show,False,"Your content is there. The app needs work. Profiles need personalization or more than just having a watchlist. For example, there’s no “continue watching” section so hope you know where to find whatever it is you were watching. Also, you can something to your watchlist. Finish it, but without knowing how to manipulate the bugs, remove it from your watchlist. Strolling through all the features, you can click on a show, and even if it’s in your watchlist, it won’t show that it’s in your watchlist, leaving you to believe programs you add to your watchlist aren’t actually there. In regards to manipulating the system to take something off of your watchlist, you have to click add to watchlist to ADD it again, then click it again to remove it. That seems to be the only way to remove a show from your watchlist. And this is a problem on ALL my devices not just mobile devices. This includes the Apple TV, and the firestick app. Disney, y’all are great but with so much content on this service, a person needs a better way to keep track of what’s in their watchlist and what they’ve been watching. Please correct this."
2019-11-13 03:32:25,"Great content, series pages need work",3,TNTisKING,False,"The amount and quality of the content here is great. However the way older TV series are being handled is inconsistent and pretty rough. Some pre-HD shows are presented in their original 4:3 aspect ratio and look fine, but others for some reason are zoomed in, stretching the image and cropping the top and bottom of the screen which looks terrible, and there is no option to switch. Additionally, nearly all the shows I browsed had every episode listed under one season, which means you can’t look for episodes by season and have to scroll right through dozens of episodes to find what you want. Some episodes are mistitled or misnumbered, meaning they auto play out of the intended viewing order. And if you plan on watching a whole series, it doesn’t appear to save your spot so you have to again scroll through the 50-80 episodes of “season 1” to find where you left off. Hopefully these issues will be addressed soon because the rest of the platform seems great and I am very excited for how much content is available to stream for the first time ever thanks to this platform."
2019-12-29 03:40:40,"Great selection, but lots of tech issues",4,GW101010,False,"I only gave 4 stars because the selection is awesome — there’s something for everyone and every mood. However, I stream Disney plus on my iphone hooked up to my TV and that has presented problems. For one, ANY notification (including phone calls) will cause the picture to pause but the audio still continues. Seldom times the show will catch up and continue, but a majority of the time, I have to restart the app. From there, the issues continue. The show seldom saves where I left off; it restarts and I have to fast forward to where I left off (or the best of my memory). Sometimes it’ll say “oops, can’t play this selection right now,” which is even more annoying because I have to unplug my phone from the adapter then reconnect it.  Also, if watching a series, I don’t like it doesn’t automatically start the next episode. Otherwise, as previously mentioned, I love reliving my childhood shows and sharing them with my children. This is priceless. If the tech issues could be resolved, I’d give 5 stars."
2020-03-20 02:55:45,I love it but there’s two things...,5,Jeylaine Gonzalez,False,"I love this app.  Is such a great way to go down memory lane and easier to find Disney films but I have two little problems. 
     I use this app in all of my devices, my laptop, my consoles, my phone,  including my smart tv. In all of those providers I can change the subtitles except for the smart tv. I found a way but it wold be a lot easier if I can do it directly in the tv. My way is going to my phone putting the options I want and turn the tv off and put the show in the tv. But sometimes it gets annoying.  So please fix that. 
      Another issue is there’s some shows that don’t have their full episodes, and I know is a new a provider but I would love to have all the episodes of violetta. A few days ago I finished the first season and when I was about to start the next one I find that the rest of the seasons aren’t there so please it would be great if it can happen. 
    But beside that Disney plus has been a great app. Keep on the good work."
2019-11-21 20:08:21,"A fantastic app and service, could use an additional feature or two",5,Spaceman11374265,False,"I hate to sound like I’m parroting other reviews, but... I honestly can’t think of another word to describe Disney+ aside from fantastic. From some of the earliest classics that put the name “Walt Disney” on the map, to the legendary pictures that make up the face of the studio and the stream of new films, shows, and other projects, there’s something on here for almost everyone.

I understand that at the time of this review, the service is just over a week old, but if there is at least one thing I would like to add to Disney+, it would be the addition of a section dedicated to some of the content that Disney has rights to (and might add to the service) that are geared towards more mature audiences, such as “The X-Files,” “Deadpool,” and other such properties or materials that might not be suitable for younger audiences (in case such a proposition isn’t already in effect).

Aside from that suggestion, this is definitely a streaming platform for fans of Disney and beyond."
2019-11-14 07:07:43,Worth it! My cats and I cant wait for updates!,4,Modern Cat Lady,False,"Let me start like so many reviews by saying that the amount of content is out of this world. I will just say I look forward to updates on this app. 1.) I would like a way to mark what episodes I’ve watched already in a series. My memory isn’t good enough to do this for long seeing as my mind is filled with the needs of my cats. 2.) I would like a “last watched” section to easily remind me what I was watching before my cats got into a major fight and I went running from my comfy chair to save my poor fat cat from her distress inflicted by my sleek sporty male cat. 3.) When my lap is being occupied by a sleeping cat, I don’t often have hands to touch my phone between episodes and since the auto play option isn’t working between episodes, poor fat cat is having to move once again. While the app is working well for my cat’s diet and fitness plan, I think these slight modifications would make it more cat lady friendly. And yes, if you did read this all the way through, the first thing we watched was Aristocats."
2019-11-19 01:43:58,BEAUTIFUL but just a few things,5,Gibgab12,False,"I absolutely love having all the movies in one place. The movies from the vault are such a blessing and it’s like I’m reliving my childhood again but the app itself could use a bit of improvement. I love how they offer a variety of section to search in and maybe find a diamond in the rough to watch but then when you do and suddenly get distracted, you lose your movie and oops! You forgot what it was called!! So I definitely definitely think it needs a “continue watching” section.
Also I heard about some of the older classics being ban being of the culture it depicts... I think this is not smart at all and hope it does NOT happen. Yes those movies depict a culture of a time that is no longer relevant, but it’s still history. What’s the good in censoring history when it’s a fact that it happened? Those movies are just what they are, classic. Definitely, most definitely, should not be put back away.
Over all love the app but maybe they could make some improvements!"
2019-11-18 05:52:06,Great so far,3,Advicegiver8213,False,"This app has all the old and new Disney including all the other major companies like Marvel and Star Wars. It didn’t have new releases but I will hope that they will be available here before release on Red box and other sites after they leave the box office. The reason I am giving three stars is there needs to be improvements made and this is a new app. There is no place to stop and save in the middle of shows and movies. It also does not tell you what you have already watched, so it is hard to pick up unless you remember yourself. I also wish they had a “currently watching” tab included with the “my watchlist” just to make the app easier to navigate. That being said I have always loved Disney and this app is a great new way to rewatch all of my older favorites that I didn’t have easier access to before this platform. Continue improving on this app Disney and there will have more people subscribed than it already does now. 
I recommend this product highly as it is reasonably priced as well for the amount of content you are given, and also has multiple profile options."
2020-05-11 23:09:11,Please Fix Sound Issues,3,alldisney,False,"I have to start by saying I am a huge Disney fan & love everything Disney. My house is all Disney & I even have a Disney Room. I’m obsessed with all Disney movies & all Disney music. And Needless to say I was sooo excited when you launched Disney+! That being said it pains me to write something negative about Disney. I absolutely love it EXCEPT there is definitely a sound issue which is very very frustrating to say the least. I checked all my equipment & compared it to other channels so I know it is just on Disney+. Sometimes you can only hear the lead singers but nothing else in the background including music! You can only hear their voices. Sometimes you can hear the music but no voices. And it changes-sometimes a movie will sound fine, other days not at all. So I know it’s not just that movie. Some of the movies have been-Descendants (all 3). Zombies & all of the High School Musicals. This is aggravating to no end. I might expect this from someone else, but DISNEY?!?-Very disappointing. Please fix this issue as I have seen other reviews saying the same thing. Come on guys, BE DISNEY!! Please & Thank you"
2020-01-06 06:07:31,Worst. Streaming. App. Ever.,1,Dan.Swendsen,False,"I was so excited for this app to come out. I have used many streaming services over the years, but have never even come close to experiencing one that is done so incredibly poorly. Even after the updates, I have never watched a solid 10 mins of video without getting an “oops something went wrong” and during those ten minutes the video glitches horribly. I have the fastest internet available, no other apps have problems. I love Disney, I love the ease and comfort of the features on the app, and it is visually attractive. But for a company as large as Disney, it is appalling how horribly the service actually streams video, end it takes me about 7 tries to watch a 1 hour long episode of The Mandalorian, regardless of what device I’m using the app on. Incredibly disappointing that Disney our the bar the lowest it’s ever been. Either they’re trying incredibly hard to not spend the money required to fix it, or there are some people that REALLY need to get fired because I wouldn’t trust them to change the batteries in a remote. Everyone I know has stopped or slowed down using the app for the same reasons, it’s hard to watch such a marvelous idea waste away because it’s being designed by idiots."
2020-07-27 23:02:42,Great But Not On iPad,4,Cool Person that u can trust,False,"I am in 6th/7th grade and my mom had always been overprotective and made sure what i watch is kid appropriate. I am a big Disney fan and so I decided download this app on my iPhone, xbox, and tv. It works great and I love the app. There are no problems, they have plenty of kid friendly shows and movies, and plenty of adult movies. There is even a setting to change your account to the kids account. There’s just one problem, I downloaded this app on my iPad and it never works. It will just say, “Oh no, something went wrong playing...” and that’s it. No options to fix the problem, and explains no real reasons it went wrong. I went to the information section of this app on the apple App Store expecting it to say something like doesn’t work on iPads. But it says, Compatibility: Works on this iPad. I don’t really know what to do except just watch Disney plus on other devices. I wouldn’t recommend this unless you have a different device to watch it on. If you do, I think you should really purchase an account."
2020-06-19 23:00:56,THIS APP IS AWESOME 😎,5,superfan890 ;),False,So I fell in love with Disney+ a minute I got it all the shows are appropriate for all ages. All the shows are super attractive they have shows from like the 2000s From 1960s even two today it’s great because there are no ads and they are really no problems the only problem I have is sometimes it logs me out or pauses or when the Device I’m using is off and Disney+ just starts playing by itself but anyways some of the shows I recommend our shake it up Or K.C.undercover or good luck Charlie or JONAS they also have a great movies they have nature Pixar Disney this app has pretty much every show ever OK that’s a little exaggerating but they have movies and shows for adults they have kids cartoons literally two-year-olds can use it. It has like shows for little babies everything on this app is totally appropriate for kids and adults there are no ads and you’re paying is so worth it! I hope you like Disney+ to because it for me and my family is amazing!!!!😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊
2020-03-18 23:35:32,AWESOME except.. READ THIS!,3,CreativeNickname🤪,False,"Ok. So personally, I love Marvel, and it is the main reason we got Disney+. But I have one major problem with it (certainly not the content 🤣).
Whenever I am watching something, like Black Panther for example, if I decide to close the app, I can still hear the audio playing in the background. Several seconds later it’ll stop, but when I open the app back up it crashes. I also have it downloaded on my IPhone. So, when you have the IPhone version you can download videos from the app so you can watch them anywhere! I was happy when I found out about this, but I soon figured out that the app must stay open and the phone on for it to download. If you close the app, it will completely get rid of the download and waste your time.. as a warning if you download on your phone pay attention to make sure Disney+ doesn’t close or your phone doesn’t automatically lock -_-. Other than that, great app with amazing graphics and tons of content and variety! PS- SPIDERMAN HOMECOMING AND FAR FROM HOME NEED TO BE THERE PPL COME ON! Also, glad Frozen 2 came and am now waiting for Rise of Skywalker..."
2020-07-29 04:53:26,One problem & recommendations,5,Disarmedtulip23,False,"From launch till today, Disney + has been a great addition to the streaming business. Almost all of the problems that I had have been fixed. Only one thing remains, anytime you go into the download section of the app, depending how many movies you have, the list will take a long time to load and when exiting a movie it glitches and you have to wait at least three seconds for it to go back to normal. For most people that wouldn’t be a problem, but for me, who has at-least eight movies from all Disney franchises, it’s noticeable. 

This next part is more for recommendations.
One recommendation I have is that when you download the movie, you should be able to get all three options of quality and calculate much storage each of the qualities take. Even though most people don’t care about deleted scenes, a minority,  which I am part of, like the commentary, deleted scenes, etc. I hope Disney will add a feature to install deleted scenes and commentary. Now this is more of a personal problem, but because I am bilingual I don’t have problems with the language barriers of the app, but to my parents it’s hard because not much content is in Spanish or has Spanish subtitles.

Apart from that, all the app is overall a great streaming service. Despite me having this one issue and some recommendations, I will rate it five stars because of the content and the quick to update responsibility. Thank you for reading this."
2019-11-13 23:42:29,Thank You Disney!,5,Cayley C,False,"Let me start off by saying this is truly is a beautiful app, and well worth the wait for the sheer amount of titles that Disney has graced us with. That being said, the initial glitches and hiccups were definitely to be expected with the overwhelming number of first-time users. However, the app is still very well designed and all encompassing, while still leaving plenty of room for future growth. I would like to see a “Continue Watching” section (emulating similar streaming apps) as I find it time-consuming to be continuously searching for what I was watching rather than having it conveniently placed on top of the list at launch. The saving grace to this minor flaw is that the app does allow for auto play, so you don’t have to go back and fast-forward to where you were previously watching. In summary, Disney + is highly anticipated app that lives up to most expectations, and can be easily improved with consumer feedback within the coming months."
2019-11-15 18:52:14,"Amazing content, app could be improved",4,MarvelAddiction,False,"Overall the content is great! There are some concerns about the app though that I hope gets fixed. Here are a few: 1) there needs to be a continue watching section so you don’t have to re-search the movie or show you were watching and have to remember which episode you were on, 2) if you’ve added something to your watchlist it should show that if you click on it again and should have a way to remove it from the list after watching, and 3) the “recommended for you” category doesn’t seem to change and is showing the same stuff even after watching multiple things so I do not believe it takes into consideration what you seem interested in. All of these also make it seem useless to have separate profiles if a single person’s specific shows are not going to show up as continue watching or recommended. Again love that I have all of this Disney content now, but would also love to see improvement in the app itself!"
2019-11-21 01:58:14,Forever a Disney Girl,4,MoMoLynnSal,False,"I am not giving 5 stars for a couple of reasons... 
First, there isn’t a “recently watched” or “continue watching” area in the home screen. Every time I want to continue watching where I left off, I have to go to my profile and then to my watch list and select from there, which brings me to my second issue. If you are watching a tv series, you select the series you’re watching from your watch list, then you have to scroll down past each episode and hopefully remember which episode you’ve left off on, because if you just click the play button at the top without going to the actual episode, it starts at the very first episode and very first season. Also, unlike Netflix, if you’ve watched an episode, it doesn’t show you in some way (a progress bar or check mark) that you’ve already seen that episode. 
Other than those 2 things, so far I am enjoying Disney+! I love Disney, and I am curious and excited to check out the “through the years” of Mickey Mouse!"
2019-11-13 05:06:58,Fabulous Launch Disney!,5,Gee You Nit,False,"Download, login, and browsing happened with perfection... the first surprise. Then the content, WOW. I knew they had to offer a lot since the claims being made by Disney prior to launch were quite bold... and they weren’t kidding, the library is comprehensive, extensively built starting with the very 1st Mickey Mouse film, and including practically everything you could possibly want from Disney (a few movies or offerings have an upcoming release date if they’re not currently available, and I certainly expected a few titles to be withheld for many possible reasons, so not disappointed about that). 
I’m personally very excited to check out all the National Geographic shows & movies that I browsed through, and watch a whole lot of movies I loved as a child & haven’t encountered for 30 years! 
But AS FOR MY YOUNG CHILD, this will now bring a lot of happiness to his life as we get to share all the incredible Disney movies with him now!! YAY!!!!! Thank you Disney!"
2020-02-08 03:45:48,"Great content, but app needs work",4,Vake Xeacons,False,"It’s great having all the major Disney content in one place, from original Silly Symphonies to latest Pixar releases. There’s still a lot missing, but D+ is new, so there’s room to add. 
My first major complaint is the video. There’s absolutely no adjustment for slower internet. I don’t always need full HD and the lines get crowded late in the day, streaming slows down. Instead of dropping resolution (like virtually every other streaming service) I’m sitting here waiting for my movie to buffer.
Next is the organization. Obviously, my “keep watching” needs to be at the top, so I don’t have to search through three pages to find the show. “Next episode” link doesn’t always appear at the end credits like it should.
A few more minorities tweaks, and it should be fine. Like I said, it’s great having them all here and a lot of these shows take me back. I don’t normally dabble in streaming service originals, or which are usually crap, but Mandalorian alone is worth signing up for this."
2019-12-12 19:09:48,Needs work,3,MTFrazier,False,"Disappointing. There are so many little things that other platforms have improved on over the years, how did Disney not check out the competition and get a jump start. 

The app is overly simple with very little ability to navigate. You constantly have to navigate back the the home screen and then step by step to your destination. The ‘continue watching’ list (in my opinion the most important space in a streaming app) tends to not show up; and when it does you have no ability to open the show’s page (thus allowing for episode selection). There is no skip to next episode button. No episode selection while in video. No tracker to show what you’ve previously watched (to know what episode your on). And difficult navigation to your own watchlist. The app is great for browsing and that’s about it, but since most people have a good understanding of what Disney has to offer this isn’t all that important. 

I love having access to all this content but that’s not what Disney+ is, it’s an experience and it’s lacking."
2019-11-12 08:38:11,Clean. Snappy. Add a back button on the left.,5,bmlm1989,False,"Just downloaded the app. I loved how clean and simple the design is. Disney’s enormous library is immediately apparent. From Marvel to Snow White, it’s all hear. As a parent of two, I really like the streamlined nature of the kids section. I was prepared to add every Toy Story movie on my own, but instead there is an entire curated collection made by Disney for easy discovery. Having all your favorite Disney movies in one place will turn digging through binders of DVDs to find your copy of Hocus Pocus at Halloween an absolute breeze. With Mandalorian already out and Marvel with a lineup of original series to come, Disney there for the parents too. All I ask is that a back button of some sort be added to the top left of page for the movies you tap on. The little X in the top right is ok, but it being on the left on smartphones is way more natural, even a drag and remove would be good. Fantastic showing from Disney otherwise. 5 stars"
2019-11-17 05:32:00,"Good... BUT, not great... yet!",4,Stanman237,False,"Disney+ has been amazing, so far! My family and I are thrilled to be watching all the old shows and movies again, as well as, all the new content! I love the Mandalorion.. so freaking good! However, I do feel there are some major key things missing that could help improve Disney+ overall experience!

1) to start, having to fast forward through the movie or show to where you left off gets real annoying real quick! Or, even having to remember which episode you are on next.

2) there should be a newly added section or some sort of indication to know that there’s a new episode or a new movie uploaded to Disney+.

3) My family and I watch it on our Samsung Smart TV which works great, but the only issue I see is when you click into a couple of shows and then click a suggested show or movie, in order for me to get back to the home screen I have to constantly click the back button. There should be a menu pop up or a way to instantly click to get to the home page or go back straight to your watchlist.

4) Speaking of the watchlist something is wrong with the add button. You can add a show or movie to your watchlist, however you can’t deselect it from your watchlist.

I’m sure there could be plenty more improvements I can help resolve, but overall, great job! I know it just came out, and we all knew there were going to be bugs and things to improve on from the start. Keep up the great work!"
2020-01-06 02:16:09,I literally love Disney+,5,plaid and stripes,False,"My friend told me about this and I thought I could give it a try. I asked my mom and she checked it out. And it was $6.99 a month! A really good deal for Disney movies, considering that Disney has a long history for classics and favorites. We bought it and I rapidly went to search for Gravity Falls. All of the episodes were there. I loved that there are some movies that aren't on Netflix and are in Disney+. The movies have a remarkable sound quality and great visuals, even though some of these movies were published in the 1930s. All of them have a variety of blockbuster films to choose from and they release earlier than Netflix does. It would take a few days or months to get a movie on to their page but with Disney+, you could admission your favorite films that were released only a few days back. Not only Disney movies, but the Star Wars series and the new and original trilogy, documentaries, Marvel movies, and finally the Simpsons."
2019-11-21 09:58:30,Don’t reinvent the wheel!!!,2,JanLouTem,False,"First let me make it plain that I love Disney+. However, there are things that are needed, and I can’t figure out why they were ignored. First, WHY is there not a “continue watching” or “recently viewed” section??? It’s very annoying that we have to search for what we were watching. Secondly, when I’m setting in my chair trying to find something to watch, it can be very hard to see the title from across the room. When I hover over the movie, there should be some sort of pop up that helps me see the selection title more clearly, the rating and a short snapshot of what the selection is about. Thirdly, when I pick up watching the movie from where I left off, it says “play” instead of “continue watching”. I realize you’re trying to be different than your competitors but there are some things they’ve been doing right for a really long time. Do what they’re doing and STOP TRYING TO REINVENT THE WHEEL!  I’ve paid for a year’s subscription but will probably cancel if these simple things aren’t fixed. By the way, I took one star off for each of the three complaints listed."
2020-01-19 05:01:15,"Great, but one slight issue",5,N8JUMPER,False,"I have been using this app for the last few weeks and I can say that I absolutely love it. However, I have experienced one slight problem. When you turn forward or backward the show or movie you are watching by 10 seconds, it gets stuck loading on the iPhone 8. This prevents you from pausing it or turning it forward farther. You then have to exit the show or movie you are watching and re-enter it. This is more of a minor inconvenience than a complaint but I still feel that it should be addressed. Also Both my kids and I used to love watching dog with a blog together on Disney channel amongst other things, as well as some distinct short films like John Henry, Feast, The Little Match Girl, and Tick Tock Tale, however I have been unable to find them on Disney+. While I acknowledge that this comment will most likely be unacknowledged by most everyone, I would love it if these changes were addressed to."
2019-11-18 02:12:29,Good app,5,andreoow,False,So the app is great and has so much but is too much shorts that are not really interesting but no Indiana Jones I mean Indiana Jones is even at Disney world. But maybe babies will watch the shorts but I think they are a waste of time and are really stupid and stop supporting gay people it is wrong read your bibles and stop making movies about nerds and wimps and maybe make them about people who actually have talents and stop making your Disney Chanel stuff so stupid they’re so stupid and are not even entertaining like nobody wants to watch people bash each other with a stick in the head those are my complaints and one more thing stop making live action remakes it makes nobody remember the old ones you walk up to a kid and you say have you seen Aladdin and they say yes but they are really just talking about the remake and if you keep making them then don’t try to shove communism and demacratism and atheism down are throats and don’t make stuff so stupid
2020-09-25 18:07:56,Amazing! Just a couple problems.,4,Star Wars fan 27,False,"Disney+ is a magical place streaming literally the best movies, with a wide verity of Action, comedy, and fantasy. Awesome Disney+ originals, and Star Wars and Marvel TV shows and movies. How ever it’s pretty hard to enjoy a series when there is several movies in the series missing. 
It all started when I was watching the Pirates Of The Caribbean, which is a truly amazing series, and a fan favorite, but the 4th one was missing. Like seriously, really? And a bit later, I watched the first X-men movie and was like ‘OMG this is good where’s the next ones?’ There were only two others which were way further in the series. So when I looked up if they were on Disney+ there was a website saying watch X2 on Disney+, and when I clicked on it, it brought me to the app, and said ‘this media is not findable’ or something along those lines. 
I understand, copyrights, and distributing trades, but this is a very annoying thing to deal with. Thanks for your consideration, and have a nice day."
2019-11-21 00:35:56,"Great content, but some issues",4,Casual gamer101,False,"The content is great. The UI is relatively friendly on both IOS and AppleTV. However, why is there not an option to resume play or to start over when you pick a movie? Having a young child we watch the same movies. Over. And over. Being able to restart from the beginning for the 90th viewing of Little Mermaid would be nice to be done at the touch of a button instead of having to pause and rewind. Also, why no chapter skip/chapter select feature to skip automatically to that one scene that the kids just have to watch repeatedly? It feels like I’m reliving my childhood not only in movies that are being viewed but also in how I’m viewing them since it’s akin to watching on VHS. If they can get these small issues resolved, which should arguably have been there at launch, it will be a 5* review. PS, Mandalorian is great!

Update: the above issues for restart and resume have already been addressed. Chapter select still lacking though."
2019-11-14 20:35:54,Needs to add option to “continue watching”,4,WeinWife1107,False,"While I am pleased with the service overall, there are a few things about it that I find to be disappointing. It is mildly inconvenient that my watch list isn’t shown on the main page, but what’s even more inconvenient is the fact that the service doesn’t seem to keep track of where I left off while watching a tv series. Every other streaming platform has a “continue watching” function, but Disney + lacks this ability. 

On a minor note, the available content is great. However, when I first heard there would be a Disney+ streaming service, the first two shows I got excited about finally being able to stream from beginning to end were The Famous Jett Jackson and The Proud Family. Imagine my disappointment when I discovered neither show was available on the service. I hope one day these get added to the service, but for now. I guess I’ll just settle for That’s So Raven and Lizzie McGuire."
2019-11-19 00:57:11,It’s a Bugs Life,3,Joy4mymourning,False,"Buggy. Incomplete. Almost like a Beta? 

While this is a new platform and is bound to have room for improvement on its initial launch, I am surprised (and honestly quite disappointed) that a company of Disney’s caliber neglected to polish their flagship streaming service this much. It fails to incorporate important elements of what I would consider basic streaming user experience while boasting a user interface that feels clunky and often quite glitchy. However their programs are organized decently well which could be a testament to their forethought or the fact that there just isn’t that much variety in content yet.

Missing elements: 
- ANY way to track series or films that you are in the middle of watching. You have to go re-search it again.
- Even when you find the new program it does not track which episodes have been completed.
- No way to customize your home page to your favorite programs.

Glitches:
- Switching from user to user will glitch
- Loading series will sometimes glitch to where only certain episodes will show- sometimes no episodes will show! 
- During streaming difficulty in scrubbing to a specific spot

Positives:
- Disney content. Let’s be honest it’s why we’re all here. Their years of labor and/or buying up other companies’ labor has paid off.
- Easy to find a specific show or movie. (Just wish I didn’t always have to!)

Long way to go in my opinion to be a polished well established streaming service, but they’re in the right track."
2020-03-01 14:14:45,Some of us aren’t five.,2,Overmaal,False,"The app is fine. It works as it should other than it buffers often. The content, on the other hand, is not what I expected when I paid. I did not pay for adult Disney movies to be edited or cut to remain “family friendly”. Movies such as “Splash” are not what they once were. As a thirty-two-year-old, I was excited to hear that “Lizzie McGuire” was being brought back and that Hillary Duff’s role as the lead, that I once loved, was being brought back as a fellow thirty-something and not the typical, stupid shows that bring them back as a parent. Not all of us are at this age. Once again, Lizzie was going to be relatable. Hearing that it is on hold to be revamped into another elementary-age-friendly show was extremely disappointing, in addition to the other edited movies. As an adult, save your money. Pay for your Marvel and vintage content, if this is what you were after. I’m cancelling my subscription and will possibly pick up the subscription to Hulu—where I hope Disney makes the right choice and places an adult Lizzie and other content they don’t feel is suitable for children."
2019-11-13 02:45:56,Can’t wait to see what the future holds,4,KOGrod74,False,"I am 29 years old and will never forget growing up watching Disney movies. When I heard about the streaming service I couldn’t wait to download. Upon downloading I was not upset at all. Neat design, easy to use, and immediately you see newer marvel movies, as well as some of the old classics. The choices are endless.

The only reason I gave it 4 stars was I first downloaded it on my PlayStation and the app said it couldn’t connect to Disney+. Checked my internet first and everything was good there. Instead just downloaded on my phone for now. I also got to the same message a few times on my phone but it was within the app instead of at first when booting it. Also just to see the amount of videos I tried to go to “A to Z” and see everything and i wasn’t able to get past “Aliens of the Deep”. I do understand that all new apps have kinks to work out so I look forward to seeing the updates, as well as watch it on my PlayStation."
2020-02-07 02:23:57,Suggestions,4,Ldsginger,False,"I’m glad y’all put a “keep watching” panel on, and I love how many shows there are to watch. I like Disney+ more than Netflix right now, if not for anything other than the sheer amount of shows and movies that were previously archived. 
I do have some suggestions, though. First is that the “keep watching” panel is currently a few panels down, so I have to scroll to continue watching. This isn’t a big deal, but it would be nice to see it without scrolling down. 
Another thing is that Netflix’s titles seemed... bigger? The thumbnails for everything on Disney+ are a little bit smaller than on Netflix so if y’all could fix that it would also be great. 
Other than those two things, I am in LOVE. I get to watch all the childhood shows I couldn’t before, and I get to see new things on it that wouldn’t be on Netflix for several months. You could say I get “the best of both worlds” (yes I am totally rewatching all of those). Thank you so much for making this app!"
2020-02-08 04:37:23,"Great Service, But a Lot of Bugs",4,ITS LIKE POKEMON!,False,"Hello! I really enjoy this app. It has a lot of my favorite TV shows, series, and movies. Disney+ has a very neat and professional layout, and the advertisement is pretty decent. It is just kind of glitchy. The Disney+ app on my 6th generation IPad has been having some issues. Most of the time, I cannot pause the video and there is just a loading sign. Also, sometimes when I go back to my ""continue watching"" screen and click on a video I'm watching it will start from the beginning, instead of the place I left off at. I've also been having some problems with Disney+ on my PlayStation 4. Multiple times during movies, the picture will be paused, but the audio will still be playing. I could not pause them. It took about a minute for them to get back to normal again. Once or twice I've had to shut the entire system down. Anyway, despite these bugs and glitches, it works great! Thank you for your service!"
2020-02-01 07:58:26,love the app... but there’s one issue making disney+ my last streaming choice..,3,annon475195710,False,"it goes without saying that the app is incredible with such amazing movies to chose from. however, every time we try to stream something to our tv using our Google chromecast, movies or shows will just randomly stop and buffer. this can last anywhere from a few seconds to even several minutes. this totally ruins the movie watching experience. 

I always update the app (i have the latest version now), but that doesn’t ever help the issue. we’ve also closed out of disney+ and restarted it, ive re downloaded the app, we’ve even restarted our chromecast. nothing works. we have this same problem every. single. time. it’s such a disappointment. it’s made disney+ our last streaming option in my household, even though we would love to watch more of it. 

i haven’t seen anyone else mention this, and i never review apps, but i just needed to mention it. will this be something fixed in the next update? how can i fix this?"
2020-08-17 14:33:05,Disney plus is great but some shows and movies could be added to make it the best,4,Tewodros Abraham,False,"So I LOVEEEEE disney plus I watched so many Disney shows and movies through my childhood years and it’s great to rewatch them and watch some new ones too the price is so reasonable, and Disney plus barley removes any shows and movies only when their contract with the creators of the movies or shows expires. Here are some shows and movies I think should be added upside down magic, Spider-Man homecoming, Spider-Man far from home, Cory in the house, and you guys should add all the episodes for every season in andi Mack I haven’t watched andi Mack in a long time so I really want to binge watch it in Disney plus even though the grandfather in andi Mack did something bad doesn’t mean you have to remove all the episodes he was in andi Mack is a really good show so pleaseeee Disney plus add all the episodes of andi Mack if you add all these movies and shows I recommended should be added I would appreciate it and love Disney plus more"
2019-11-20 04:35:41,Would love it if it actually worked!,2,PETAsupporter,False,"Every time I click on a video to watch it says oops something went wrong, the sound doesn’t line up with the characters talking, or when it finally does start to work it will buffer forever while my internet is great, and start playing in English AD, then it will almost immediately say oops something went wrong. I don’t even select the English AD it just automatically starts playing and when I try to switch it back to regular English it locks up and takes forever. I can’t even close my phone. Tried to contact support and tried the online chat. Told me my wait time was less than 30 mins. At the 30 min mark it kicked me off. So I called and was on hold for 2 hours just for the person to tell me that he was having trouble with his app too and it was a technical difficulty and to try back in a few hours! I pay for this and don’t want to have to wait to watch it. It’s not even been out that long so why is it already messing up so bad! It would be wonderful to watch all the shows that I loved during my childhood."
2019-11-12 14:43:56,Love it but,3,Pocojazz,False,"Love Disney love that most movies are available. But here's the caveat that's not listed. For some movies a not available in your area error message comes up. I'm in the United States. Not sure but maybe if a cable network is showing movie in my area, I have to wait to watch? I'm also a smidgen peeved that recent movie releases currently on cable pay per view, are not available on the Disney stream yet, despite Disney marketing saying that they would be. Two examples are the live action Aladdin and the live action Lion King. No reason why these two aren't streaming as neither is in theaters now. 

The only other issue I see so far is the lists. For example, pull up Marvel. Not all Marvel movies are listed under this tab. But if you do a search on an actual movie title it comes up. 

So all in all this is still a great value and I will probably continue to subscribe. There are so many great movies on here. Hopefully these things I mentioned can be attributed to a new streaming service getting off the ground and will be fixed shortly."
2019-11-20 16:38:14,Needs some tweaking.,4,Yurilia2010,False,"Big disney fan. I was so excited for this app.  I really do love the content. All my favorite movies from my childhood, and all my favorite original series and movies. I love the movies. I get to sit down and enjoy a movie with my daughter for an excellent price thank you disney for thinking about the lower class. I really did think it was going to be expensive and almost didn’t try it out. Here are my buts. When i see a movie and have to leave mid way. I would be nice to login and be able to see and just start it. Instead i have to search for and then press play. And sometimes it restarts. Same for the shows. I love the simpsons but when i go back to watch i have go to the season i was on. Then scroll until i find the last episode. Sometimes its hard because i cant remember and there is no way to tell if i have already seen it. So of you could please work on that, to me, the app would be perfect. Thank you. Have a wonderful day."
2020-01-05 23:40:53,It was good at FIRST,5,thatwitch11,False,Ok we know that Disney is amazing enough to come up with this streaming service. But the first time I streamed something onto our old viso tv it was fine it was the mandolin and when I finished it my iPad was fine. Then one month later. I streamed the whole avatar movie onto the tv the same one and my dad was watching the playoffs so we had to do it in my moms bedroom. Then after the 3 hour movie I noticed my iPad colors started to act weird and when I called my friend my iPad started to act weird and as we called the colors started to change on every thing on my cousins hair started to change to silver and when his hair is brown and everything started to change to white black and blue. I still like Disney plus but not when they break my iPad and my mom said I’m not gettting another one unless I buy one and I am in no position to buy or demand one please fix this or tell me this an Apple issue
2020-01-01 01:51:37,Love the content but app leaves a lot to be desired,3,Bayuze,False,"No need rehashing all the good things about the content and nostalgia and all that good stuff - I’m going to go straight to the point. Two big issues for me: 1. Lack of auto play and 2. Being unable to skip end credits. Auto play should be a setting we can toggle off or on (or apply automatically) especially on the Apple TV app. My daughter loves to watch the Mickey and Minnie Mouse cartoons which are about about 3 min 30 second in length but due to the lack of auto play I have to be on hand (every 3 mins!!!+) to fast forward through the end credits and the click on the next episode to play on the Apple TV. On Netflix it works differently as auto play kicks in and loads the next episode. If this can be fixed, that would be great. On the app it’s the same but slightly different as there is still no auto play but a box pops up on the bottom left which my daughter has now learned takes her to the next episode but an auto play option would eliminate that."
2019-11-14 03:35:45,Minor “settings” not included with Disney+,4,PleaseFixTheseDisneyThanks,False,"There is not a “continue watching” or “recently watched” section so you have to search for what you were previously watching. Then let’s say it’s a TV show, you can’t just press play at the top bc it’ll play episode 1 each time starting you from the beginning. So you can’t press play so you have to search for the episode where you left off. And Disney+ doesn’t make it easier to search for the last episode you watched because all the episodes don’t have that colored bar many streaming services have that show how much of an episode you watched or if you had watched it at all. It looks like an app created for children in it simplicity. These are just some of the “settings” I've taken for granted that other streaming services offer aside from this app. Other than these minor problems that I’m sure will come with it’s future updates, it’s content is amazing and worth the price."
2019-12-03 08:14:43,"All the favorites, one small problem",4,Disappointed with iTunes,False,"Just like everyone else here, I was very excited to use Disney+ and watch all the old favorites along with the new original shows. I’m very happy with the service thus far but I’ve been having an issue with the auto play feature since the release of the app. I use my iPhone X to cast Disney+ movies/shows to my Google ChromeCast. When watching a show, the app will stop streaming after the second episode. It’ll go back to the placeholder screen that says “Ready to cast” but it won’t let me select the next episode. I have to disconnect my phone from the ChromeCast, close the app, then re-open it and reconnect to the ChromeCast. After that I can play the next episode but the same thing happens again after the second episode. Not sure what the issue is, this doesn’t happen when I use other streaming apps like Netflix or HBO GO. A fix to this would be appreciated. Other than that, Disney+ has been great."
2019-11-13 17:48:24,Needs some bugs to be fixed still... but understandable,3,Sneakymo192,False,"So, the interface design is elegant and clean, I haven’t experienced any weird lagging or anything of the sort and the image quality is really great (I can’t say for sure as far as audio because I don’t have a setup that could allow me to fully appreciate this at the moment). However, my biggest issue with the service right now, and this is not just for the iOS app, but for every format including Roku and the website itself, is the fact that there isn’t a “keep watching” section, thus making me have to do a manual search if whatever I’m watching isn’t immediately recommended to me or manually saved to my watchlist. To this I’d also like to point out that when I do the search, I’ll often have to remember where I left off in a series because if I just search what I was watching and press play, it’ll just play from Season 1 episode 1 of whatever series I choose, regardless of the device I’m watching from. Other than that good job guys!"
2019-11-27 10:34:15,Hard for Younger Kids to Navigate,4,.......Nikki............,False,"This is a really good app, and I can see it only getting better. Baby Yoda needs to be a profile picture option. I have a sister who has poor vision and can’t read, and the app is hard to navigate for her. She goes off of pictures to find her favorite movies and shows. I think Disney+ needs to take some pointers from Netflix’s kid section. It’s very easy for children to navigate, even if they can’t read. I feel like the categories need to be better organized. I don’t know what a lot of the category titles mean. The content is amazing, but I hope they add more or keep rotating content. I binge watch TV, and I see me running out of things to watch in a couple of months. It seems like the app has content more geared towards kids, but is hard for them to navigate. I love the watchlist though, because I went through all the movies and TV and was able to add her favorites, so she only has to look through those."
2019-11-17 00:36:10,"Great Nostalgia, Needs Tweaking",4,DanielChaidez3,False,"I am just as excited about having all the movies I grew up with available to me just as the next person. Any movie made from Disney is on here and so I can only prepare myself for what is surely going to be weeks worth of binge viewing. 
One thing that I, and many other viewers I have talked to that have the app, would recommend is the inclusion of a “recently viewed” or “continue watching” function. I would love to pick up where I left off watching wether it be a movie or a specific episode in a season. 
It becomes frustrating when you’re halfway into a season and there’s no progression to show which episodes have been viewed and which have not so it essentially becomes a guessing game. 
Overall, if the app designers include these kinds of functions, there’s no reason not to purchase a membership if you’re looking to reminisce at all the pieces that Disney has released ranging from their newest films to their old classics."
2020-04-01 18:29:54,It’s a great app! But I wish it had a larger variety of shows!:),4,Evabebeva,False,"Disney+ is really amazing for streaming different shows and movies on different devices made by Disney, they have a large variety and full episodes and full seasons, and great selection of movies too, I really enjoy the app, thank you! But, it would be a whole lot better if it had a larger variety of Disney channel/Disney XD shows for example ANT FARM, LIV AND MADDIE, AUSTIN AND ALLY, MIGHTY MED, KC UNDERCOVER. I was very disappointed in that department of the app because I had begged my mother to bye this app for me and for one of these specific reasons and I would feel really bad that my mom would pay the extra money for some shows that aren’t even on there:(, I EXTREMELY encourage if you guys could list a few more Disney channel/Disney XD shows on there then it would be a lot more enjoyable, if you could update the app that in this type of department of the app that would be really helpful😁. Other than that, the app looks great!:)"
2019-11-17 15:06:28,Still needs work guys,4,MaryJ808,False,"Disney just deserves at least 4 stars but the app needs work. When switching devices or watching it in the same device the next day, it doesn’t save which episode you were on. There’s no continue watching category. No watch list category 
It definitely needs more categories, I can tell there are more movies on here than I can see because when we search other things come up. It’s not displaying anything and there’s no where to view them. 
I love having Disney shows, Pixar and right now I’m watching National Geographic. I love having them all at my finger tips and I thank you greatly for making Disney+. I’m looking forward to updates...
I love how you can skip Intro. View similar videos than the video your watching. That movies like turner and hooch are on here also! Definitely could use more movies like that. That you can make as many profiles as u want! Super awesome feature, has to be your best feature."

However, when compared to a more experienced streaming service like Netflix, the manner in which the wonderful films and TV shows are being streamed to our devices falls a bit short. The mobile app (for both iPhone and iPad) glitches quite often and is slow at times. There is a recurring issue with the Chromecast feature in which is crashes if the user attempts to skip forward/backward using the 10 secs buttons. This makes it difficult to enjoy. Another Chromecast issue is the lack of customizable audio while streaming. Without the ability to choose another audio setting besides Dolby 5.1 (which my TV does not support), my audio constantly lags and it is very frustrating to watch content most of the time. I’ve always been a Disney fan and would love to see these issues resolved as soon as possible. Thanks!"

They also include marvel movies as well as starWars, National Geographic, and Pixar. The streaming app really gives me the chance to reminisce on all the old shows they used to watch when I was younger. But the only problem that I have with this app is that when I am watching a show it doesn’t have a continue watching so I would have to always go back and and search what show I was watching before find the episode that I was watching before and it really is a lot. Because half of the time when I am watching a show i always forget what episode I’m on or etc. so if Disney improved with this I wouldn’t have a problem and that is the only one that I have this app other than that it’s pretty cool."

But on to the good stuff. You can watch ALMOST anything that you want! Get your own channel and check back later! I love this app! While my sister’s watching “Bluey” I’m watching ZOMBIES 🧟‍♂️!

I got out of it, then later decide to resume and watch it. As soon as I open the app back up to watch it, the sound of the show starts playing but there is no video with the sound. It literally was playing out of nowhere without me even clicking on the show. And when I kept trying to press the show to resume, it played new sound over the sound that was already playing. Why was the show’s sound playing without the show even being on? Even when I logged out the sound was still playing! Only time it would stop is if I got out of the Disney plus app. I had to uninstall. This is bogus and such a waste of time. Fix your site/app Disney. You guys aren't broke.

I went to the support and read that it might help to uninstall then re-install the app. I tried it, but this time it would not even let me login to my account. All it said was, “We’re having trouble connecting to your account” I decided to try a live chat and was put on hold. My wait time said less than 30 minutes. I was waiting for about 20 mins trying to connect to an agent when out of nowhere the screen went blank and said “session timed out due to inactivity” I could not get ahold of an agent at all.

Another thing I think should be fixed/changed is how they post movies/shows that you can’t watch yet. It’s nice they’ll eventually be available but it’s on the app like you can watch it till you click on it and it says it’s not available for a year or so. I understand that someone else has the contract still but it’s like a tease saying here it is but you can’t watch it yet unless you have whatever other app it’s still on.

It should have been an easy answer: go to where you choose a profile and select “edit profiles” and then select yours and you will see “language”. No, instead the man right away told me to just click “App language”. Where? Instead of answering me he told me to then go grab my phone, translated app language for me to Spanish (because my phone is in Spanish) and told me to just select that. 1. I can speak Spanish, especially basic Spanish so thanks for the insult. 2. If it was that obvious I would have done that. Then finally I got him to tell me where to find that. I was so frustrated.

And if you minimize the app, when you reopen - Home screen. Not where you left off. And since there’s no continue watching option, you have to scroll/search to find it. And if it’s a series, you open S01E01 no matter where you were watching last. Also there’s no indication of having watched an episode, so you’re left picking through until you found where you left off. Literally, no one wants to do this!! This is why EVERY OTHER SERVICE offers some sort of continue watching..or better yet, when I reopen the app just show me what I was watching. Why are these simple options not on this app? And now with the new articles about the app being hacked and accounts are up for sale on the Dark Web within hours of launch? I’m not sold. It may be cheap, but that doesn’t make it worth it...."

I’m saddened by the fact when picking a profile icon Captain America wasn’t one of choices. I thought maybe it was because his contract was up but then I saw Iron Man! I’m crushed. I had to go with my second choice Yoda and I guess he’ll do. 

Joking aside there is a lot of content and I’m excited to give it a go. The UI is simple and easy to use so far 5 star experience ok actually a 4.75 you can have the last .25 when Cap is an option for profile icon 😜

6 months or so in and I like it still but I guess if I’m honest I’m disappointed by how little content there is for adults. I get the draw is family entertainment but you do realize that children sleep right? Thanks to Covid-19 there doesn’t look like there will be any new marvel content for the foreseeable future. I think the biggest mistake all the streaming services made when they launched they depending on their Library’s of already released content to bring people in. While yes people will watch them, for the most part they’re the added bonus not the draw. Especially if it’s still airing repeats on tv. Unless they bring on some content for adults and I don’t mean sex or graphic violence I would settle for sitcoms that aired like on abc or even fox to fill the time till the Marvel series premier.

2019-11-23 21:50:05,Missing Something....,4,SNAPhotog,False,"First off, thank you Disney for making this awesome vault of wonderful movies and shows available in one big app. So far, haven’t had any real issues with the app itself (I’ve only used it with my AppleTV). Wish going back to the main screen was a little easier with that after looking through a ton of movies that I added to my library. 

I’m also thrilled that you included Avengers, NatGeo and Star Wars into the mix of classics. But there’s something missing from the Star Wars collection... The two (if there’s more than that, I’m sorry, but I’m going off of what I used to have recorded onto VHS’ from back in the day) EWOK MOVIES!! If you’re going to include the side stories and collections from the Star Wars franchise, one canNOT leave out those love able, yet feisty bear like creatures, and their movies that give more background into who they are! So please, for all of the Pete’s (Peter Parker included) sake, give us our Ewoks back!"

There is only one issue I see as of yet that I’m hoping will get fixed soon: a “continue watching” section. It is quite annoying to have to go back to the search engine and type in the name of a movie you started watching. Netflix is generally set up the same as the Disney platform, so maybe do exactly the way they have it, one more of the sliding rows with the currently watching shows and movies. Only remove a movie from there when it is finished. 
Other than that, the platform is a thrill, some movies are still missing but i understand it has to do with the streaming contracts those movies share with other streaming platforms. Still, it would be nice to have them join into the platform asap. 

Over all, nice job! I wish more big studios followed in your footsteps."

Now with the shows it is great but it doesn’t have mighty med which is a show I know and love. Mighty med also have a collab with lab rats but they have one part of it and that is the lab rats one also not to mention that the viewers are left on a hanger then on lab rats it is like it never happened like it all just happened in an alternate reality. Another thing that is not on Disney plus is some of the Pixar and Disney movies. Pixar and Disney are a really great companies and I am GLAD that it is on Disney plus but some of the movies aren’t there like Toy story 4 or Aladdin the live action movie or Frozen 2.

So basically on Disney plus there are some movies and shows that are not there. I would really look forward to seeing some more of Disney XD shows."
2020-06-08 15:10:33,I want to love this app...,3,tinytina08,False,I truly do because of all the great content for anyone to enjoy. But for me I am having a lot of technical issues that don’t seem to get worked out with updates. Things I add to my list disappear being the biggest challenge. I will add a movie or show. Click on something else. Go back to said movie or show I added and it’s not been added to my list. Or something shows it is in my list and I go to my watch list but doesn’t show it in there. My list only shows about 10-15 things I’ve added and shows duplicates. I have added way more than 10-15 movies/shows. It’s on all the devices not just one. Everyone on my account has this issue. Finishing a movie does not take it off your “continue watching” section. Having an option to auto-play the next episode in a tv series would be nice. If the price went up for this I would not keep it because of these issues I have that do not seem to get resolved with updates.
2020-07-06 18:45:34,Great App and Content,4,dameech01,False,"I love the Disney+ app and the ability to watch all my favorite content. Things like old animated films, the Star Wars movies, and Marcel now have a permanent home for viewers to easily watch consecutively. The original content like the Mandalorian is also amazing, and I look forward to upcoming originals in the works. 

My only complaint with the app is it’s slow buffering time, especially when connected to Chromecast which is how I play content on my TV. I normally need to shut down the app and go back in which wastes a lot of time. Even when it finally goes to a certain place in the video, the user control for finding a place in the video is tough to use and again, buffers slowly. This is not as big an issue on the computer for me, but I think Disney can improve the software to make the user experience more seamless.

Thanks Disney for a great app. I think any fan should get it."

She got it and I asked her what was she doing. She said, “I’m getting this app for y’all to watch it has Disney movies and shows on it” by y’all she meant me and my brothers and sister. I love watching it too! I was so happy when my mom said she’s paying for us. Now I can watch anything on my laptop and phone! When we had Direct TV we could only watch some episodes of Disney channel shows. And it sucked. Now I can watch shows episode by episode. I’m so glad that this exists! I can watch any show/movie I want at home when I’m bored! This is the best app ever! I’m so amazed. I never thought my mom would let me and my siblings get an app like this! 5 stars!! 😌"
2019-12-03 02:45:05,Unorganized,3,90sLVR,False,"First off, this is my very first app review. I’m usually not so frustrated but I feel Disney needs to hear a few things if they’re going to be in the game with Netflix. 
Ok, great start. Really, I love seeing all my favorite movies and shows in one spot. Plus, there’s a little bit for everyone. Nat Geo, comics, Star Wars, Pixar... etc! 
However, not all the shows show up. For instance, I randomly came across Doug, The Simpson’s, Goof Troop, Talespin, 10 Things I Hate About You and so much more! The best way I’ve found to find my old shows is going under the “suggested” link. These shows should show up under the “shows” tab. 
Also, on my Tv I’m able to scroll over and see “my list”. In the iPad app, this doesn’t exist. So all those shows I hunted for and stumbled upon are just MIA unless I type them in. 
Overall, I’m excited to see my childhood favorites but we’re a month away from the year 2020! This needs to be streamlined and simple. No more hunting just display everything up front!"
2019-11-16 05:34:41,Needs playback memory and sound glitches,3,Tmntrc1262,False,"I really like how it has everything Disney on it. I have two major issues with it though. One is on the app as a whole and the other is specifically on my Samsung tv app. They DESPERATELY NEED a playback memory or “currently watching” tab with memory of where you are at in the program if you pause and come back to it later. Gets old really quick when I have to fast forward through a two hour movie to get to the spot I left at. The other issue is on my Samsung tv. Every program I start, no matter what it is, has a sound/video glitch in the first 5 seconds of starting the movie/tv show. The sound is then 5 seconds behind the video for the rest of the program unless I close everything and restart my program. Other than these two things, it’s ok. Like all the shows and movies, old and new. But unfortunately, based on technical difficulties and poor user interface, it only gets three stars for me."

Closed the app down, brought up, still the error but hit to retry and bingo. I was able to screen mirror from my IPad to my Samsung TV and watch a show around 10 am. Later that day Samsung had the App available for download to my TV. We watched a Movie that evening. As far as shows in a series being released once a week, that is normal since like when TV was invented. News has reported about how expensive it will be for people to be paying for all these individual Apps. Internet is about the price as cable and how much do we complain about nothing to watch. Not no more, just don’t get that many apps that it becomes expensive. Disney+ gets my approval. A new venture for them with a little rocky start so give the tech people a break to get the bugs fix."
2020-02-24 02:52:27,Great Nostalgia/Needs Improvements,3,dmock17,False,"When we first got Disney+ we were very excited and loved all of the cool nostalgic shows that they offered. Most of the initial bugs were worked out fairly quickly after the initial launch of the app. However, the more movies that I’ve watched that I am more familiar with, I’ve noticed that they cut some of the movies differently than the original Disney Chanel showing. For example some movies such as Lemonade Mouth and Camp Rock have key scenes cut that are important contributions to the plot of the movie. I’m sure there are other like this too. Movies on Disney+ should be cut the same way they are originally shown on Disney Channel. I’m not sure why Disney decided to cut scenes but it doesn’t really make any sense. Not sure that I will keep it after the free trial for this reason, but also because I feel that eventually I will grow tired of the familiar movies and TV shows. I would need to see more original content before I would consider keeping it."

I wanted to say this app is great and as said in previous comments, I love the diversity of older content that can be hard to find and it makes watching the newer stuff easier too. Lovely. But I have a few problems with the way things work within the app. Maybe it’s because I’m too used to Netflix (😱 oh no competitor name), but is it wrong for me to think that your movie or show should pause when you answer a phone call? I had to answer a phone call that ended up being longer than expected and when I came back, I was suddenly halfway through the movie I started right before the phone call. There are other issues similar to this that I can’t pinpoint at the moment but I’m not trying to be overly negative either. I enjoy this app a lot more than I expected I would and am glad for it. But issues like this being fixed would go a long way towards making it even better. Thank you for your time and have a great day 😁"
2019-12-08 02:14:12,This App should much better,3,A Disney Dad,False,"With all the money and all the resources available to Disney, this App is a sorry excuse for the brand. Extremely low quality operating system with a number of issues earns this 3 star rating. While the library and original content is all what you should expect, the user friendliness and overall navigation is far behind the curve of today's standards of streaming services. 

I used the download feature for the new Star Wars series and found it “buffering” multiple times during viewing and pausing and skipping. Any attempt to rewind or fast forward caused serious malfunction and unresponsiveness from the App itself. I never have such problems with titles downloaded from other services and should not experience playback interruptions once title is downloaded to devices “hard drive.”

I challenge Disney to improve the navigation within movies themselves i.e. Fast Forward, Rewind, Pause, etc; as well as the download feature."
2019-11-27 13:00:49,Needs a little work...,2,Aniyah_PYG,False,"I just want to say that I overall love Disney+ but there are some things that need to be worked on to get my rating of five stars. First of all Why is there no continue watching bar!?!?!? That is very important, it is irritating that I have to search up my show or movie again and again just to keep watching it. Second Every like 20-45 seconds Disney plus will start buffering in the middle of my show and it’s goes on for about a minute. I’ve checked my internet and WiFi and they are both fine so it is not me. And last but not least I think it would be a good idea to add new movies that are coming out from Disney in the time span of at least 1-2 Months. I think that would get you a lot more people to buy this app just because how early you guys put movies and shows on. OH and also I think another good idea is to put like little short videos on here of like either behind the scenes or just a little short clip extra of a movie so yea overall tho’s are my main concerns and ideas."
2019-11-17 13:22:17,Frustrating,3,Jbbrokenleg,False,"It is so frustrating using this app. My kids are younger, so they like to watch Disney Jr episodes over and over. Some days you can’t watch the episode because it always starts where you stopped. So half the shoes are stuck in the credits because the app will auto advance to the next episode right before the credits end! Also it’s really hard to rewind and fast forward. The show will stop and say “oops something went wrong!” Some movies and shows have scary parts for my kids so we fast forward. It’s not like we are letting them watch Marvel, it’s things like Jafar or the evil queen in the classic movies that make them afraid. I want the option to fast forward to be easier. 

Also, if I’m paying a monthly fee then I’d expect if a movie is available to buy in the store then I should be able to watch it on Disney plus, but no the newer movies aren’t on here. 

I’m glad to have so much on the app for the kids, but it needs a lot of work."
2019-11-16 07:39:55,The Little Things that Ruin the Magic,2,RJ Jackson,False,"Quick version: good content, bad app in experience. Binge worth content on anti-binge platform.
It’s great to now have (most of your) Disney content in one place. As they evolve I’m sure that they will be rolling out more content.
There are some major over sites that Disney has failed to consider. With all the content available how do you not have a “continue watching playlists”. This is a standard feature on most, if not all SVOD platforms. One is forced to remember and re-search there content and episodes when re-opening the app or exiting their current view. Also my auto play is currently not working. I’ve heard this is an issue for other users as well. You’d like to sit and binge your favorite new or classic Disney content but app is set up to deter one of achieving that goal. I hope the app developers know that they still have a long way to go to create a user experience that is on par with rivals such as Netflix. Nostalgia can only carry you so far for so long. Disney, you can do better."

I am a little disappointed at how disorganized the categories are (and I’d like to discover or rediscover more movies, so I was hoping for them to include all content that fits a category rather than a handful). Can’t complete my profiles or browse Marvel or Star Wars yet. I’m checking that up to a large amount of people trying to utilize the servers on opening day and don’t expect that to be an issue long-term. It does appear that they have a kids account. I have server issues when trying to set one up, but am hoping that I can select/control what content I’d allow for my child. 

I’m happy that they added documentaries and older content, so I won’t just be watching shows from my childhood or today’s pickings. So far, it seems to be worth the money. I’m not sure yet if it’s capable of working with chromecast."
2020-03-26 17:04:39,How is this app such a train wreck??,2,iFlipPhone,False,"Who is in charge of app development for the Apple TV?!  Most companies would probably fire employees for not doing their job correctly.  Not sure if it’s different for other gens but the Apple TV4k app is very buggy.  It’s as if they created the app and then never actually tried it out before release.  One of my biggest complaints is having to start the movie from the beginning after you’ve watched it through to the credits.  Most other streaming apps will consider the movie completely watched once you hit the credits at the end.  Disney+ does not.  If the movie does not play all the way until the end of the credits, it will resume to where you left off in the credits when you try to watch it again.  Most other streaming apps at least give you the option to Resume or Start at Beginning.  Why not here?!  

Sometimes when you leave the app, and then open it back later, it just resumes whatever you were watching earlier.

Other times you will get a black screen with the audio playing in the background.

Every now and then it just crashes and exits the app.

Some of the shows don’t have the option to pick an episode until you start the very first episode.  Then you can back out, scroll down, and sort through the episodes.

The only reason I gave this app 2 stars is because we love the content, and they have the different genres/franchises laid out nicely.

PLEASE TEST YOUR APP AND FIX IT!!!"
2020-01-28 23:58:10,Old Simpsons in 16:9 aspect ratio only? Shame.,4,AD.P.,False,"Overall satisfied with the app, but the old seasons of the Simpsons have been reformatted in a 16:9 aspect ratio to fit modern TVs. That means the original 4:3 frame is chopped and this isn’t how the show was meant to look. Some visual gags are even ruined because part of the frame is missing due to this reformatting. It’s a well known defect. FX solved this problem with their FXNOW app, which let users choose between 4:3 and 16:9 when viewing The Simpsons. The Disney+ app should have had a similar feature at launch and amazingly still doesn’t have it. Various publications have called this out. The Simpsons is one of the marquee Disney+ titles, and Disney has spared no expense and has done everything possible to make sure you know they have this show, but in 16:9 it isn’t quite the same Simpsons you know and love. It needs to be available in 4:3. Other than that, they did a nice job."

On the movie:I was only able to watch 30 minutes of it before I had to stop it. When I went to finish watching it later in the day, the app won’t let me. I kept getting a message so I just deleted it and will go back and watch it later.  On the show I downloaded, I was 10 minutes into it and the show froze up. I couldn’t finish watching it. Every time I tried to start it again the show just spun and then it kicked me out of the app.  So I just deleted it off my iPad and watched it when I got home.
Watching movies and shows on my iPad while connected to the internet seems to work fine. But I’m disappointed that I can’t download a movie to watch while on my lunch break or away from WiFi.  Thanks"
2019-11-13 14:37:42,"So far, great performance, and design!!",5,GBR4EVER,False,"Disney+ is here and it seems that it lives up to the expectations. I heard of some people having issues with streaming opening day but I have yet to have issues but also my internet connection is quite good. None the less, first impressions of the design and look of the apps interface is sleek and user friendly. Very similiar to Netflixs mobile app. Really like how they broke out their content into their own designated Disney “Universe”. Im a 29 year old male and have no kids but grew up watching all the Disney films and am a big Marvel and Star Wars fan so there is a lot here already to take in and its AWESOME. I got my 1st year free cause Im a Verizon Unlimited member but as of now if the price on the subscription doesnt increase by next year, I would consider paying the $6.99 monthly fee along with my Netflix and Prime sunscriptions. Happy streaming :)"
2020-10-18 23:05:59,It’s great,4,Totodile1027,False,"I really like Disney plus, I do have a few issues though. My biggest issue it Andi-Mack. Numerous people would agree that Andi-Mack is one of the best shows Disney has produced. I used to watch the show a lot and I never finished it. I went back to watch it but almost all the episodes are missing. I did some digging and figured out the reasoning behind it but most fans are more upset than happy about it. I won’t talk about the detail in any way but consider putting all the episodes on there. The situation is done and in the past, theirs nothing you can do about it and no fans blame the company in any way, shape, or form. The episodes you cut out show nothing explicit, so please do consider bringing them back. All the fans would really appreciate it. The show is something a lot of kids now days should be able to see, it’s very inspiring and brings light to a lot of bad situations."
2019-12-30 05:01:26,Overall great streaming service,4,Toby6023,False,"The content On Disney plus is amazing! The only reason it’s short of 5 stars to is due some features missing.

On roku for some reason i cannot turn on subtitles which is a big deal to me but i can when i use the app or log in online. Also on the roku it is difficult to rewind or fast forward because you can only move by 15 second frames, can’t hold it down and it doesn’t show frames like on Netflix so you can visually see where you are at which is very convenient.

Also i wish that Disney plus would allow you to sign out of all devices because i log into a bunch of devices and sometimes that results in people having 24/7 access to my account that I don’t want. I reached out to a Disney plus member about this online and the only way to do that is to completely change your account email which i do not want to do."
2019-11-21 02:14:27,In Love but still a little heartbroken,4,Mamameaaaa,False,"I loveeeeeeeeeeeddddd Disney when i was younger so this app is awesome for me and my little girl. Not only do i have some classics really almost all of them but it has Marvel and Pixar. The only thing i was hopeful of was seeing Proud Family from episode 1. Add that and a couple other shows and movies and it’s 10 stars for me . Also , it’s a little tedious that when switching from mobile app to smart tv devices I have to go search for what i was previously watching. And even once i get back to the shows page it doesn’t play from where i left off. It seems there’s a few ease of access updates that could be set in place. Right now it feels like you’re just trying to show us the endless availability of great shows and movies but i can’t wait to see the transition into making this app flawless through and through. 

But. Please. Add. Proud. Family. Lol 💙✨"
2019-11-16 19:25:22,Pretty great but needs a update IMMEDIATELY,4,ratseat,False,Disney+ is the best for watching all the old tv shows from the 2000s and Disney channel movies. I love that I have everything Disney at my fingertips but it needs to be improved on. First of all there has to be a counting watching tab. I want to be able to watch something and come back to it without having to search it up or add to watch list. Also I forgot what I have watched sometimes so a continue watching tab would be perfect. Second episodes and movies should have a way to indicate where you are in the episode or movie. I never know what episodes I have watched because it doesn’t show you anything. And lastly the watchlist needs some improvement. I should be able to remove things from my watchlist. Also movies and tv shows should show if they are in your watchlist and not all just show a + sign even if they are in your watchlist.
2019-11-17 03:56:54,"LOVE all the movies and shows, but the app needs to be fixed!",4,raaaaaaaaachie,False,"i absolutely love disney+! i'm so glad i can watch all of my generations shows and movies and introduce them to my son. but i've heard that disney+ will be taking movies off and cutting scenes due to certain ""inappropriate"" content. its sad that people now are so sensitive to things, if they are offended, they don't need to watch it or have their children watch it! it was normal for a grown man in the 50's and 60's to be smoking a tobacco pipe, theres no need to cut movies due to that! and along with everyone else, PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE add continue watching!! its so frustrating to try and find the exact episode and scene i left off on a show. again, please don't take everyone's favorite movies and shows off due to people who EASILY get offended, it's ridiculous. people need to ease up, there are many of us who can agree that it is not ""inappropriate"" in any way."

However, it’s completely inexcusable that my watch list is still broken even after all these months since launch. On the first day, I excitedly added tons of stuff to my watch list. I noticed over time that my watch list was glitched and it hasn’t been fixed at all. Not even half of what I’ve added is actually saved to my watch list, only random titles. Not to mention when I go to add something to my watch list it doesn’t get added anymore and when you click off the movie/show and then click on it again it acts like I’ve never tried adding it before.

Disney is a massive company so I know they have the money and resources to fix the issues with the Disney+ app but it says everything about them that they haven’t even made an attempt to fix my issues and many others I’ve seen in other reviews."

2019-11-12 10:44:23,Should I be ashamed?,5,sweetlittletink,False,"Let me start by saying the app downloaded and opened without issue. Great format, content is unsurpassed (duh) and I have experienced no glitching or anything as of yet. Great app.  
As a 35 year old mother of 6, I wonder if I should be ashamed of how excited I AM for this app. For myself, I mean! Lol I have been counting down the days and now it is here and I am so excited I don’t know what to watch first. Probably, Robin Hood, but having these Disney classics right at my fingertips is amazing. My birthday is next week and I have seriously been saying that all I wanted was Disney+ to hurry up. And health, I want my health back as I suffer with chronic, often debilitating, conditions. Disney+ is now here so maybe my health will follow. Lol 

Okay, to summarize, Disney+: GET IT NOW! The app is great and the content is everything you want and so much more! Happy streaming my Disney people!"
2020-04-04 18:01:58,"Outstanding, but could have more shows",5,Mckayla The Reviewer,False,"I love Disney! It is an amazing place to go to, and if you ask me, they’re the best ones to create shows and all kinds of movies. But, the only thing that should be fixed is the lack of movies that people love. And this is just my opinion, but, I would just want someone to look at this just in case they are questioning getting this app. But other than that this app is so amazing in a lot of ways. It only costs 6 dollars a month! Hey Disney, if you look at this, I am just going to say, I love everything that you have ever done. Disney + is amazing everybody, so don’t just take my word for how Disney + is. But if anything, this is definitely a 10/10 review. Just try it out, and you know you will like it. I sure did! I watch Disney everyday. So, I hope this helped. Bye, and thanks for reading!"
2019-12-15 07:56:20,I LOVE Disney BUT,3,NoelaniKai,False,"I’m a huge Disney fan since I was young. Trips to Disneyland being a So. Californian is a regular thing and movies are a treasure to me. But the glitches on this app is Killing Meeee when trying to watch things. It works half the time. Will load slowly or play the audio and pause on the video trying to load it then ends up playing from when it first glitched. Or when it isn’t working and I go to watch from where I left off it starts from a couple episodes ago. I knew it would the first couple weeks being that everyone in the world (who can) was pretty much jumping on board. But it’s been a a while and I’m sure they’ve had enough feedback and they def have the money to hire the best to fix these bugs, I’m sure they will, I just expected them to do it sooner than this because they are about quality. I’ll give them a better rating when they work better than Netflix. Common Disney! We need glitch free Disney Magic!"
2019-11-16 18:30:10,This is great! ... just not quite there yet,4,RebekkahCST,False,"I love the fact that there are so many options from Disney, Pixar, Marvel, Nat Geo, and Star Wars. As well as all the original Disney channel movies therefore fulfilling my childhood dreams and allowing me to be a kid again. 
With all the joy this new streaming service has given me there are just a couple of things that needs to be fixed and or added. 
1. There needs to be a continue watching section. I don’t like the fact that when I go to watch an episode of a show I have to scroll through and try to remember which episode it is the I am on. Same with movies. Sometimes I can’t finish a movie and I want to come back to it but I can’t because I don’t remember how far I was in the movie. 
2. There needs to be a way to Mark already watched episodes 
3. Keep the old shows the way they are don’t sensor them for more sensitive audiences. Keep them the way they were and instead write a disclosure about how this was a different time and the current Disney franchise doesn’t reflect the same ideals, but respects the original artistry of the shows and therefore will keep them as the were. 
4. The auto play needs to be fixed. Sometimes it works and some times it doesn’t. 
Over all I am so happy with my Disney plus but I hope that in the future updates these issues become resolved"
2019-11-12 09:27:48,"Needs More Original Content, But Excited for It Long Term",4,_Vices_,False,"Title says it all.  I realize part of it is the fact they're using the weekly release schedule for original content (to start at least), but it still feels a little underwhelming at launch.  Long term, I know that the Disney+/Hulu/ESPN+ bundle will be among the best values in streaming, especially for families.

By the way, props (or not) to Apple for being so underhanded and hiding Disney+ in search results for the app (I imagine because of Apple TV+ and feeling threatened, even though they haven't even proven themselves capable of being a competitor to either Disney or Netflix yet).  I had to pull up the page for another app and go look at all apps developed by Disney just to find it.  Granted it has only been up for a couple hours, but still, it's not like the thinking at Apple was ""not a lot of people will want to download this right as it goes live."""
2020-02-29 18:45:44,Amazing  but one problem 😁,4,Gamewardens girl,False,"I love Disney movies and if you do I recommend you downloading this app it’s amazing. You get to watch every Disney movie.  But there is one thing that was very confusing. One day my family and I wanted to watch Captain America on our tv. So we  put the HDMI lighting adapter.  in our tv like we usually do when we watch Netflix. But it didn’t show the movie on our tv. I would really appreciate someone would fix that thank you. 😊

    I really enjoy that you get to download movies that you can  watch anywhere at anytime. How come   Disney has  to have gay people in Disney shows.  It’s  disgusting little children don’t need to see that. God made Adam and Eve. Not Adam and Adam or Eve and Eve.  Walt Disney would not approve of this would he. Half of the people are not Gay in the world so why do we have to watch people who are so please don’t put Gay people in Disney movies. Thank you for reading."
2019-11-12 17:26:04,99% perfect,4,kktmvp,False,"The app is great and the content is even better. Through playing around, searching and watching, I’ve noticed a few things to improve to make it even more perfect. For starters, a resume watched section right on the homepage to show what you’ve been watching. Also it’s kind of weird when you play a movie then pause it, then go back to watch it the button doesn’t show that you’ve watched it or how much time is remaining. Also, it would be nice to move the watchlist to the homepage as well instead of in the settings. The homepage would be better if right below the Disney/Pixar/Marvel ect. buttons that you put a continue watching section, then the watchlist section, then continue with your originals, recommended for you ect. Also I love the collections feature on the app. Hopefully you expand that over time with different subjects and themes."
2019-11-28 01:38:46,App is great when usable,4,Copy1235,False,"I have been locked out of my account since the day I purchased the subscription and could only watch two episodes of content until that happened. Currently I can’t login at all without being told to call customer support and to add to that I’m put into the longest wait line ever because as I understand I’m not the only one. And this is all because they have had too many people sign up for the service as they said on their Twitter help, though I don’t understand what they were expecting being that they’re Disney. How could they, the largest entertainment company handle this so poorly?

Edit: I have now worked out the issue no help from Disney, I understand that they were limited but they shouldn’t have done it like this. Reminds me of Rockstar with Red Dead on PC these companies can’t just wait, maybe we should all just wait."
2019-12-21 13:13:51,Misleading Advertising,2,Q. Mediocrity,False,"I love the app; it’s worked just fine for me, except for a few sign-on issues at the beginning.  My only issue is that Disney advertises that it’s all of Disney, all in one place, but this is a total sham.  It seems like half the movies I search for won’t be available until such and such a date.  Many of these aren’t even brand new releases (some I tried to find were released in 2014!)  They advertise that “The vault is wide open,” but still keep much of their content under lock and key to keep us paying for their app until we can watch what we thought would be available from the get-go, based on their publicity.  False advertising!  It would be more accurate to say, “The vault is partially open, but you’ll have to subscribe for ages to get the content you really want.”  This being said, I have enjoyed viewing what content I DO have access to.  It was just highly disappointing to see the dreaded yellow print: “Coming in XXX, 2020” on so many films."
2019-11-19 06:00:20,No Currently Watching Area,4,Smartyskirt24,False,"I love Disney plus so far! However, one thing that is severely annoying is the fact that there is no area to view what you’re currently watching or have ever watched. You just have to remember what you were watching and search that up. There’s not even a progress bar when you click on that movie to show how far you were into it. Sure, it saves your progress and you can see that once you play the movie. But it’s extremely annoying to have to remember what you were watching and go find it again if you don’t watch it all in one sitting. That’s my only complaint. Otherwise, all the other features are great. There’s CC, skip forward and backward 10 second buttons while playing something, you can set up profiles for people, etc. Please Disney, make a currently watching or recently watched tab for us!!"
2019-11-16 03:29:48,Room for improvements,3,xdaBidx,False,"The content is great. Movies, older TV shows, shorts. The quality is pretty good considering how old some movies/shows are. Separating Star Waes from Marvel from Disney helps with looking for stuff. A couple of improvements:

A “continue watching” section is missing. Unless you’re watching something featured on the main page or categories, you have to use the search option to find whatever it is you’re watching.

When I have gone back to watch something I was watching before, it starts from the very beginning so I have to scroll through the timeline to find where I left off from the time before. So not only having continuing a movie/show where you left off but also accessing that specific title from the first/main page.... a la Netflix i guess. 

Scrolling through the titles is not the fastest. At least with a PS4, being able to use the L1/L2 or R1/R2 buttons time scroll over 4 or 5 titles at a time would be great. Holding down the left or right directional button only movies one title over, it doesn’t keep scrolling. 

Another PS4 issue, the subtitles do not sync up with the audio. The subtitles appear on the screen about a sentence ahead of time. 

Personalization of the profiles is pretty cool. Changing profiles names and being able to choose different characters is awesome. 

Looking forward to more improvements."

I don’t see myself canceling ever ever ever . My new go to. I l or the way the site and app is designed as well . I’m especially a fan of “out of the vault” for Disney fans we all know how special that is . I’ve been counting down the days for this and it did not disappoint. ❤️🐭✨"
2020-03-19 22:24:11,Great APP,5,chdygdgjdjeixc,False,This is one off the best apps I have ever downloaded it has everything I need all the old shows that don’t play anymore you met get a little disappointed when they don’t have one of the shows that you used to like but they so many other great shows that don’t play anymore you will just forget about it. Also on this they have some shows that don’t even play on tv. Also any amount of people can use one account unlike Netflix were you have to pay extra if you want multiple people to use that account. And that is why I like it is also pretty cheap to get. Saying how many shows they have on the app it just a great app and a good way to catch up on some old classic shows that rarely play on tv any more. And some don’t play at all any more this is just a great app to get.

Lol 😂 anyway, about the downloads thing. I downloaded some movies for a trip where I’d be offline. So when I got on the plane ✈️ , I clicked my Disney+ app ready to watch my favorites. It said my downloads were complete, it even had the check mark. But when I went to play it, it said it was unavailable for playback. All my downloads said it. I was upset 😢, cause now I was movieless on a very LONG flight. But I later connected to a friends hotspot, and downloaded another movie.  And it worked. So I recommend double checking, just to make sure your downloads are actually downloaded. 🙂 Overall I do love Disney+ , but I think it’d be nice if they improved their download feature. Well thanks Disney!! And thanks for all u do. 👍👍🙂☺️"
2019-11-17 00:38:33,Disappointed,2,_EdgeOfSanity_,False,"So I’ve been really hyped up to finally see what Disney+ is all about, my family in the states downloaded it and got an account. And I’ve heard absolutely wonderful things. This isn’t why I’m disappointed though. I’m disappointed because I am unable to access Disney+ in Okinawa, Japan—while being stationed here as a military member. I’ve heard that Disney+ has all my favorite childhood cartoon and movies, and it would be so wonderful if other people like myself overseas would be able to get a taste of home, y’know? Maybe one day Disney can possibly make it to where streaming in another country is possible, like Netflix. But for now, I gotta say, Netflix will probably be our go-to movie streaming app because we’re able to access it. I understand it’s probably hard to make these things happen, but imagine the possibility of being able to stream a movie or cartoon over FaceTime like we do with Netflix?? The long-distance movie date nights would be spectacular!!"

I just wish there was something small. I wish there was a ""watched"" feature like on Netflix and other apps. It would make it a lot easier to check if you've watched an episode of a show you're binge watching. For example, right now I'm watching Hannah Montana and I took a break from it for a few weeks due to school work and being really busy. Because of this I forgot what episode I left off on and I had to skip through a few episodes to catch up and remember what was going on. With a ""watched"" feature I would know where I left off the last time I watched something. Besides this, Disney+ is amazing!! I highly recommend it!"

Then I got to see all the classic Star Wars!!! 🤩🤪🥳 it has all my favorite movies on it, except.... Spider-Man. I think Tom Holland is my favorite actor. And I loved him as Spider-Man in the movies.

2020-02-10 04:26:43,Great movies,5,PeachLover__123,False,Maybe you guys should add more Disney shows. I love Disney channel and Disney+ but it needs more greater and better shows that can make peopl happy and we need happy shows that make you smile. Cause I love Disney+ but it needs lore shows all shows make you happy but we need some more like a lot of shows but if you guys have time to read this that would be fine cause I really need someone to read this. If you guys don’t wanna add more that’s sad. I’m just saying this is my opinion i’m trying to make this opinion for everyone that loves shows maybe they wanna watch a new show on Disney+ that’s what people need new shows I love big city greens and I love Disney+. If you don’t read this you won’t know the idea. This is just an idea for people that wanna watch different shows that they’ve never seen before.
2019-12-03 06:03:17,Disney Plus- Almost there,4,Scaler911,False,"After a little over a week, I’ve canceled one of my several other streaming services, because there’s a lot of content here. Time will tell if it’s kept fresh and updated- or if they did the “IPO” with a bunch of blockbusters to get me hooked, only to taper off in a few months. But I’m optimistic. 
The only couple things that needs refining in my experience so far are: if I leave a movie and come back later, when I hit ‘resume’, it just starts at the beginning again. No big deal, except when I scroll ahead to the point I was at, when I take my finer off, it’s jumps several minutes (like 10-15) the other direction. Not anything more than an annoying inconvenience. 
For developers: I’m casting to Chromecast  from an iPhone X. Everything is UTD software wise. 
Get that fixed, and keep up the selection, I’ll keep on subscribing."
2019-11-15 03:47:42,Issues=preventable bugs not “high” volume demand,4,ihaveknoidyeah,False,"Need to fix video format capabilities across platforms. Watch videos just fine on IOS IPhone X, XBox One, but can’t watch on Apple TV Gen4 without going to video format 720p SDR 60Hz specifically. Hope that helps others out there. Kind of crappy since TV and platform are fully HD capable. The app and content are supposed to be as well. Not so much an issue with volume straining bandwidth of servers vs bugs that should have been caught before this rolled out. 
Would have given much lower but with the amount and quality of content, I’m pretty happy as long as I was able to figure it out since there was not a single Disney provided solution for this out there. Otherwise from such a name brand that has the money and ability to have bug proofed this other than maxing out bandwidth before rolling it out, I’d given them a fat zero."

Butttttt i really wish there was a ‘continue watching’ tab or something like that becuz it’s kind of a hassle to go and search for something that might not be on the first page and if my watchlist is pretty full i still have to scroll and find what episode of that’s so raven i was watching. Being able to rate what you watched so if you’re watching something new you can remember if you liked it or not and help out with the recommendation suggestions because just because something is on my watchlist doesn’t mean I’ll love it. Still veryyyyy excited for everything on the service, it was a great idea. Great content and greattttttt quality. Absolutely love it.

2019-11-20 20:30:37,Alllmooosttt theereee!!,3,mr.duuude,False,"In the words of my girl Tiana the app is “almost there”. I LOVE Disney +. So far this app has been a dream, there so many things that I haven’t been able to watch or even find on the internet that I now have access to and I’m so excited for even more.
My main plight is the lack of a “continue watching” feature, I know everyone else has said it as week but I’m a Leo so I gotta make sure people see my opinion too lol.
I also wish there was a little bit more in terms of searching for things. The main page doesn’t show me everything on the app so it can make it hard to discover new things and I feel like I could get bored after a while being recommended the same things.
There’s still time though! I’ve still got to finish watching my childhood of Hannah Montana and That’s so Raven, I’ll come back to update my review after the first update or once the season are all gone, whichever come first."
2019-11-17 04:12:59,👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻,1,Ncbelle15,False,"Very disappointing, I just cancelled my trial before the end of the 7 days. I never heard about Disney + until it started showing up on my social media news feed so for a free trial I thought hey why not check it out. My daughter asked me to delete it off her iPad within 5 minutes and I have yet to find a movie available I want to watch. On the first day the app launched I found several movies I was interested in watching only to click on them and discover they were not available till 2020, one of them (I believe Maleficent) not available till late October 2020. This seems to have since been remedied with unavailable movies no longer showing up on the app but those that are available, out of all the Disney & Pixar movies made are seriously disappointing. Happy to stick with Netflix & Prime Video, their user interfaces are far superior & the watch options are so much greater. Nice try but a huge disappointment. Even for a small child a Noggin subscription is a better value since it has games + shows. 🤷‍♀️👎🏻🙅‍♀️"
2019-11-14 17:31:33,Excited but some fixes needed,4,kschlu,False,"I have been soooo excited about this platform. The selection is great and I cannot wait until there are more originals to watch. I don’t know how I feel about releasing an episode a week, but I am sure there is good reason. It just seems like a step backwards into the world of TV versus new technology a streaming. I noticed two things that I hope will be fixed immediately.1) many times when I start a show, the sound and the visual is off a few beats. I have to restart the program and it usually fixes it. 2) I have not figured out how to pick up where I left off in a show. It seems I have to track where I stop so when I come back to it, I can fast forward to where I left it? That seems odd. There should be an option to start from the beginning or to resume. Has anyone else been having these issues?"
2020-10-09 19:36:09,But we never get to watch Mulan!!!!!,4,Unicorngirl366,False,"Hi! I absolutely love watching things on Disney+ and every movie is free!.... well not every movie. Mulan is not free. It made me so sad that I gotta PAY for a movie! I understand if it was a lot of work and payed a lot of money on it but not so many people gonna watch it if u need to PAY for a movie! My mom is also disappointed in this that you gotta pay. Like she gotta pay on groceries, she gotta pay on traveling, she gotta pay for Christmas presents ( she makes presents every Christmas ) like it’s not like we have to pay for these things. And as you saw on the title it says we NEVER watch Mulan. We really want to but we gotta pay! My brother disappointed too cause he loves when his favorite movies turn into movies where real peeps act the movie. He got very mad too. ( he gets mad if something not going right ) so plz plz PLZ let Mulan be free!!!!!"
2020-09-20 01:52:51,Great for kids. Gets old quick for adults. Not much content,3,rabz9,False,If you have young kids it’s great.  Don’t think twice -get it.  My review is for people with older kids and fans of Marvel and Star Wars.    My teen girls do not watch it at all. As a Marvel fan and Star Wars fan that has seen all the movies it’s ok to watch here and there but completely lacks new stuff.  One series that had little action the Mandolorian. Not better than any of the movies. Content just lacks. I guess Netflix spoils us. Disney has almost no weekly new releases for all ages like Netflix. and when they add new movies they want you to upgrade to a more expensive plan when you’re already bored of the current plan. Because there’s no new content?  I can not justify continuing after Verizon’s free year.  I rarely use the service.  Rare to see anything new for adults that doesn’t require a costly upgrade. Did I mention I’m bored of the same content?
2020-05-28 15:41:28,Great App + A Suggestion!,5,[please insert nsme],False,"Hi Disney+ Team! I love the accessibility of this app and pretty much everything about it! I have watched so many movies while in quarantine, so out of the vault, others being brand new. You’re new movies are amazingly done, such as the talented CGI of the live-action of The Lion King, the impressive storyline and animation of Onward, and the heart-warning, emotional story of Stargirl. 

Suggestion: I think the app would be even better if on the home page there was a “Coming Soon” section to get people excited for upcoming tv shows + documentaries + movies, such as the long-awaited upcoming adaptation to the Percy Jackson and the Olympians series! 
Lastly, thank you so much for making the recording of “Hamilton” come out so much sooner! Me and so many other people are very grateful and happy. 
That’s all! Sincerely, a huge Disney fan."
2020-04-26 01:06:50,Nothing compared to Netflix,3,KingsKid101,False,"I’d like to start off by saying that I really like the app, and I like the content but the app is so much harder to use than Netflix. Here are my list of problems. 1)After finishing an episode, it doesn’t automatically play the next, so I have to manually scroll to the next. It wasn’t a problem until now I’m on episode 50, and it’s really annoying at this point. 2) It’s so hard to find new things that I like. I know there are a lot of good movies on here, but I can never find anything unless manually search for it. I don’t know if an algorithm is used to display movies/tv shows but what I’m seeing is definitely not what I want to watch. 3) Finally, I don’t know if it’s just my phone, but after I close the app, the content continues to play. It’s kind of annoying to have to make sure it’s paused before moving on. Other than that, I really enjoy using this app so far!"
2020-03-31 04:05:25,Won’t waste my money!,1,Kmurray78,False,The kids have been dying to get Disney+ even though we’ve seen 75% of the movies on here I thought why not try it out and see if it’s something we’d enjoy $6.99 a month really isn’t that much I mean come on you waste more than that on junk you don’t use so since the kids are out of school I decided why not try it free for a week to see how much we’d actually watch it I am so glad there is a free trial! I would be very upset if I had actually paid for this it is so annoying every time you start a movie it cuts off and has to reload it does put the movie in the continue to watch section so you just go down to that and start it back up but if you had searched for something then all the results gone so you can’t watch the movie then hit back and pick a different movie you have to search again start the movie it cuts off reloads and you scroll down again to find the movie in the continue to watch section I’ve cancelled my subscription it’s too aggravating to pay for
2019-11-26 08:24:37,Watchlist Messed Up,3,50pixie05,False,"I added a bunch of stuff to my watchlist the first day I got the app and everything was fine and then a few days later when I scrolled through my watchlist it stopped about halfway through as if there was nothing else to load. Then it would load more items but they would be the same things that I just scrolled through, so it’s like half of the movies and shows I added get repeated twice but a bunch of other stuff is missing. It’s been this way for about a week now. Definitely makes it annoying and difficult to find things I want to watch because I can’t browse everything I’ve already taken the time to add to my watchlist. Glad a continue watching section has been added to pick up from shows and movies I’ve left off on, but it would also be nice if the individual episodes had some sort of status bar of how much I’ve watched them, if at all."
2019-11-15 00:20:17,"Content is great! Ease of use, not so much....",3,Emma_ily,False,"I was so excited for the app to launch because I kept hearing great things about the content. Content is great and it’s so nostalgic to see movies and shows from my childhood! However, the ease of use is awful. The watchlist is not easy to access. Why do we need a widget on the bottom bar for downloads? It would also be great to be able to leave a movie or an episode and have the app save where you left off! I have also noticed that the app does not show if you have watched something either. Now I need to remember which episodes of what series I have watched and if I leave something in the middle I have to remember where I left off. I hope this is improved in a later update! It would be great if the watchlist and download placement was switched, and if the watchlist also included things you were currently watching. Looking forward to seeing updates!"
2020-02-11 12:44:31,Constantly doesn’t work,2,hholly80,False,"I downloaded this app when it first launched and the whole family loves all of the content. Disney+ has a huge variety of things to watch. There were frequent down times at first. Which was to be expected with the app being so new. Things soon leveled out and worked perfectly. Still occasionally it would have a “ bad day” but after going through the fix all with all things electronic things would work fine. I am currently having issues with the app. It has been over 2 weeks since it worked. I have deleted and downloaded again, disconnected from the internet, I have even reset my network, and still no Disney+. Every other app works so I truly believe this is a Disney+ error and needs to be rectified immediately. I realize things happen and it takes time to fix but I feel like 2 weeks is plenty of time. This Is a service we are paying for and to not be able to use it is not okay."
2020-03-22 22:26:08,Couldn’t even get started,1,Jlbrock41,False,"I am a huge Disney fan and was finally going to hop aboard the bandwagon and get a Disney Plus account, do the free trial, and see if it was something I would pay monthly for. However, I created an account, put in my email and password and then was met with a notice to contact customer service. I tried multiple times to log in on the app and on my laptop, to no avail, saying my account is blocked.

My one star is for the company, not the app specifically. After a search on Reddit, it seems that this problem has met a lot of others besides myself that planned on being payed customers that are discouraged due to these unknown errors that caused them to be on the phone with customer service for hours. The results are workers admitting that they have no idea what the problem is and the customers having to create a new account and cancel the old one. I will have none of it. I will not call customer service for 3 hours to have them tell me that there’s no real problem. Please fix this."
2020-01-25 01:10:41,Great app but content loading Too slow !,4,Yassytorres,False,"I downloaded this app days after release. I love the app and so does my daughter. It has all the best Disney, Pixar, cartoon and even marvel movies! My daughter is non stop at rewatching her favorite Disney princesses movies. But i do have a problem with lagging. I have Verizon wifi so i never have problem with loading movies or anything on other sites. But i do with this Disney plus. Every Time i put something on for my 3 year old the movies always freeze and the audio continues or take very long to load. I barely use the app as much now because my daughter complaints every time it freezes so i have no choice but to put Netflix for her. I use the play station console to use the Disney+ so i dont know if thats the problem but i never have loading problems with any other. Please fix this. I love the app."
2019-12-12 05:17:11,Not impressive,2,User_Nombre,False,"Here are my issues with Disney+

The main screen: The main screen is a series’s of rows of thumbnails, just like Netflix’s setup... but there is barely anything there. What I mean is, you scroll through about ten or so titles in each category which is in reality a tiny fraction of what’s actually available. So, in order to find something to watch you have to think about a title you’re looking for and search for it in the search bar. What I found even dumber was that the same thing is true in the more specific “categories” sections. For example... you can visit the Star Wars category and scroll through all day long and NEVER find “The Last Jedi” but it’s totally available, you have to search for it though. Dumb. So dumb. 

Subtitles: My partner is hearing impaired and we watch tv with subtitles on 100% of the time. The subtitles on Disney+ across all of the platform always show up about 6 seconds too early, causing confusion about who is speaking on screen. 

Loading: There is always loading problems. Skipping, loading, restarting when the scene finally loads up... really annoying. I actually turned off the app and decided to watch Avengers:Endgame on a different platform. One that doesn’t have loading issues. 

All in all I’m not impressed. But I paid for the year so I guess I’ll tune in again when the new Marvel TV shows come out in the spring, binge those, and cancel."
2020-02-24 03:43:52,Not up to the Disney standard quite yet,3,miresi26,False,"I wish I wouldn’t have been so anxious and waited before purchasing a year of this service. It’s still very buggy and slow, which is to be expected but it’s making the user experience a bit frustrating. I LOVE the content and the simplicity of the app. But trying to remember which ocean doc we’ve already watched so that I don’t keep clicking the same one, is insane!! I literally keep a list of which Nat Geo and shorts we’ve already watched. Please fix. 

Also I forgot to log out of a device while traveling and now everyone who visits that Airbnb probably is using my account free of charge. I wish I could log out of it! Please fix. 

The content is there and you’re adding new things all the time but it’s hard to get pass those two issues for me. I hope we continue to see more issues resolved since I’m stuck for a year with this service."
2019-11-25 16:11:43,love the app but a few suggestions,4,qveenjayxxx,False,"I love the disney plus app and all of the classics that are there that i watched as a kid, however it could definitely use some improvement. I understand that it’s fairly new and upgrades will come with time, but these are just some suggestions for the future. 
First, i wish you could make a favorites list or something so you don’t have to re-search what you were currently watching.
I also wish i could go back without having to refresh/restart the entire website (on pc).
Next, I think there should be a way for you to skip end credits and go straight to the next episode/movie, similar to netflix.
Lastly, for some reason, the skip intro button doesn’t skip the entire intro, not a big deal,  but something that can get a bit annoying when you’re binge watching a show."
2019-11-25 04:48:39,Almost fantastic.,4,Whoisthedoctor_sherlockrocks,False,"I was so excited to finally get Disney+ because I would finally be able to show my kids the stuff I grew up watching and also see some new stuff myself. My first disappointment is the lack of a “continue watching” section, especially given the fact that there was forethought into being able to set up multiple profiles. The other disappointment is with a number of movies being listed but not actually being available until 2020 or even 2021! I mean what the heck Disney? Are you telling me that D+ isn’t going to be fully up and going with all content for 2 more years? That seems a little lame considering we’ve all been waiting 2 years to get this service after it was announced. I guess for now I’ll enjoy the content that is available and try to wait patiently for what’s still missing."
2020-04-27 16:53:39,Overall Great App,4,FurryHorseGirl3000,False,This app has been great!!! I have it on my Roku and on my IPhone! The only downside is it doesn’t stop like Netflix or other apps do! It will play all night without stopping and you wake up at 8 and it’s still playing!! There also aren’t shows on there that should be! Like who wants to watch “Diary of a Future President” (which by the way that show is crap) when other shows like A.N.T Farm aren’t even on there. Plus you can’t advertise that you have all of the movies and shows when clearly you don’t!!!! I am still waiting on movies like Enchanted to show my 5 year old sister!! Read people’s reviews on what shows and movies they want before adding crap!! We are in QUARANTINE nobody wants to watch movies about the Earth. Or Diary of a Future whatever. All of these new shows (besides HSMTMTS) are crap. Walt Disney would not have wanted this!!
2019-11-19 01:02:29,No “Continue Watching” feature,3,Dixielanddog,False,"Mostly a good experience. No problems with the workability of the app. I like that I can watch the old Disney movies I grew up watching.

I don’t like that there’s no “continue watching” feature. You have to search for the tv show you were watching then sift through all the episodes trying to remember where you left off. It’s hard to remember, especially when your binge watching, where you left off. With a show like The Simpsons, with literally hundreds of episodes, it can take awhile to find where you left off. 

The only other thing I don’t like is that they’re kinda misrepresenting themselves by placing icons and titles of movies in rotation that aren’t available. They will be available, but not for a few months or even a year on some titles, which does nothing for you now. It’s annoying to see a title while browsing through the content and get exited that this title is among the available titles. But, no. “Due to licensing issues this title won’t be available till October of 2020”. Wait, what? Why do you have it in rotation with the watchable content? It should be in its own category(“coming attractions” or something) instead of in the “Action and Adventure” category with other titles which are available.

But the app itself hasn’t given me any issues and is mostly user friendly."
2020-05-01 00:20:41,Please do more anime 🥺❤️🍥,5,🖤💎🖤,False,"Ok I have no way to watch anime aside from DVDs and CrunchyRoll is 17+ so I can’t even get that but I’m a BIG anime enthusiast. Latterly the first movies I watched were ponyo Totoro and the cat returns and like every Other Ghibli movie my favorite show has been Avatar the last air binder, do you know how hard it is for me to be left hanging with naruto I can’t watch Naruto what ever that last word says until I’m 17! Sasuke is still with the bad guys!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!😭😭😭😭😭. Granted you do have one anime it was great by the way but as a webe I NEED more so in conclusion, I would appreciate more anime from Disney in the future.                                                                                                  
 P.S.      the inter time I was watching future Avengers, i was pumping my fists saying “This makes all my wildest dreams come true!!!”"
2020-02-22 02:39:58,Some minor improvements that need to be made,4,Daily Mimi,False,"Overall Disney+ is hands down one of the best streaming services and I love it so so much. There are still somethings that could be improved like the continue watching. After you don’t watch a show for a while the show goes away from your continue watching list. This is really annoying especially considering that a lot of people may not be able to watch anything for a few days considering work, school, etc. Another thing that could be  improved is that not all great Disney shows are on there. For example, the new season of Raven’s home. Season three is on Disney channel but yet not on Disney+. One main reason this deserves four stars is because some shows are not on it. For example, Mighty Med was a great show with lots of viewers yet they do not have it on Disney+."
2019-11-17 02:01:42,Has some kinks,3,Mdenington,False,"I’m disappointed that there isn’t a “continue watching” feature and each time I go into the app I have to search for the correct next episode in a series. It’s not that big of an annoyance when you’re a few episodes into season one but will get annoying very quickly as you move beyond the first few episodes of a series. It doesn’t even mark them as watched so if you take an extended break you’ll have to have a good memory to remember where you left off. 

The auto-play of next episode feature is also not working, at least not on my iPhone. I have to manually hit play for the next episode to begin. 

There are several Disney junior shows (kate and mim mim, Goldie and bear, Sofia the first to name a few) that no longer air that we were hoping to see on here, especially since one was recently removed from Netflix, but I’m hopeful they’ll eventually be included."
2019-12-23 05:34:40,Can’t Register/ Start Free Trial (FIX IT DISNEY!!!),1,D_Guyz,False,"I’ve seen and heard of Disney+ plus for a while, and finally decided to “try it” (after seeing so many cute scenes of baby yoda in the madalorian). So here I am installing/downloading the Disney+ app, and suddenly when I tried to click the “ START FREE TRIAL” button, it gives me this error “Sorry, something went wrong. Please try again later” with two options button that I can press “Retry” or “OK”. Press “retry” many times, nothing happens still on the same screen, tried the same thing pressing “ok” choice again same thing only without the “sorry, something etc, etc...”

Come on Disney fix these. These is the only ever and first time (I hope) that I actually commented to an app w/ a complaint even before “trying” to use it. MOST of all this is not a Good First Time Impression to your customers (that could be lifetime). I know you might not (deeply) care (being that you guys a what a multi billion even trillion dollars company) but at least hear this comment out from an average joe."
2019-11-20 06:18:10,BURY MY 1 STAR OPINION,1,MeaKmeakmeak,False,"Uhhhh, sadly it’s easily something to NOT love, we already own basically all the things that are on here. From movies to t.v. shows we have it. There isn’t really anything new with the exception of the mandalorian series (which only has TWO episodes that I see). Disney paid a lot of $ to hype this thing up and you can tell, vast amounts of ppl signed up. I can easily say I will be sticking with my other streaming subscriptions which have content that is fresh. It’s funny how the “from the vault” section or whatever is supposed to be something to be excited about...lol, guess what we already have them so how about I open my vault for free and enjoy them.... I’m not trying to dig you Disney I’m just saying that I was excited yes, but after a day or two we planned to cancel. You can charge me the $6 if you really need money for the 6 or 7 days we had it. BUT SOMETHING TELLS ME YOU DON’T NEED THE MONEY NOW DO YA....lol... I’ll be watching the web to see if you actually make fresh new content but as for now it seems boring and just ......MEH."
2019-11-18 16:57:32,Best thing since television,5,noperski,False,"Honestly I’m not that old to know if TV being brought out was that amazing however, I am old enough to know some of these classic movies. Those old VHS tapes and scratched sup DVDs that would skip over key scenes midway through movies is now a thing way in the past. I remember sitting with my family and enjoyed watching Star Wars and Beauty and the Beast as a kid, wondering man I wish we could have all the Disney movies. Well now that I have kids of my own, Disney Plus has really allowed me to have that on my phone!!!along with firestick.. etc... also, Disney has allowed my family the opportunity to relive those moments in time while creating new moments with the Marvel lineup and countless other Disney Junior lineups. One of the best apps ever created for family interaction and just utter JOY!"
2020-05-09 08:39:11,UX on AppleTV: 1⭐️ / Content: 5⭐️,2,AmplifiedLife,False,"Please fix navigating extras on Apple TV. Scrolling left to right in extras, while exploring, or just trying to find something specific is frankly unpleasant. The text describing details are cutoff, and even the program length (time/duration) is pushed out of view by long clip titles. How do I differentiate between a 2 minute deleted scene and a 2 hour behind the scenes documentary. A lot of video must be going unseen because of this.

The iPad & iPhone apps already scroll vertically when browsing extras so I can see everything “as intended” there. But on the Apple TV, where I actually want to watch this content, usually it’s not worth trying, because you can’t even see what your choosing sometimes. It’s so bad I had to write a review. The Content is obviously great. But Disney+ Apps (each and every single one of them) should be equally great. Period. The resources are available to the developers! so the expectations are high. As they should be."
2020-02-24 02:29:21,Cannot get it right,1,Kkkkkhhhhyyyt,False,Went through the Verizon plan to try for a year. After a few say I was kicked out of the app because apparently there was an issue with the birthdate link to my email. They supposedly fixed it by having us transferred to my wife’s email. A month later the app tells us our subscription ran out. When I call the supposed fix was never actually fixed. They put us on for another month assuring us that this time the issue would be fixed permanently. Even going as far as sending us an email so that we can correspond should the same issue arise again. Well another month has gone by and the app again says the subscription has run out. I try reaching out via the email and never got a response. There are far too many streaming apps to have to call in and ask Disney + every month to fix their issue. It’s obvious Disney was not prepared to enter the world of streaming. And it’s obvious that their product is far to expensive at the price of “free for a year”.
2019-11-26 22:33:54,One key feature to add (added!),5,Mr. T-O,False,"One key feature; continue watching. 

It’s nice to have all this content to watch, but it’s a hassle to stop mid season on a show and come back a day or two later and have to recall where you were. Granted, it does recall where you left off in the specific episode. It would just be more convenient to have a dedicated row to things you are currently watching. Where you are one click away to continue where you left off, instead of going to the magnifying glass, looking for the show, going to the season, maybe it was this episode, dang I should of wrote it down, okay it’s this one; it would just simplify things, in my opinion at least. Thank you for your time.

(Updated!): Disney + now has the feature “Continue Watching”, thank you guys so much! This makes carrying on where we left off so much simpler and faster. I can’t think of anything else to make this amazing service even better than it already is; other than wishing it was Friday again to watch the next episode of the Mandalorian, am I right?

Thanks again to all the members of the team that made Disney + possible, your names remain unknown but your exceptional work is visible for all to see."
2020-02-21 09:16:31,No Way to Delete Viewing History (Customer Service was no help!!),3,tatertot717,False,"I think this app is wonderful, don’t get me wrong, but there should be a way to delete the TV/movie history you (or somebody who also uses the same account) watch. One of my younger relatives sometimes uses my account and usually plays TV shows (that I don’t watch) so it kind of bugs me when my history is clogged with shows I don’t watch. I contacted customer service to see if there was a way to get rid of viewing history but they said they don’t even HAVE that made yet. They suggested to skip the entire episode but since it’s a TV show, it plays the next episode, even if I cancel out. Hopefully Disney will add that in their next update(!!!!!). It took Netflix awhile to add that feature (on their website, not on the app btw) so hopefully the people behind Disney+ will add it soon and not years later (like Netflix)."
2019-12-19 11:11:20,Platform can be better,2,temarisand333,False,"The content is ok. Love the classics and being able to see the all the Disney animated movies and shows. But Disney needs to stop playing it safe. There is not much content for adults, and what is for adults is still family friendly Witch knowing Disneys history makes sense but if this platform wants to be more they need to step it up and take some risks. The overall platform could use some work. The overall design feels lacking. It looks like it was made in the early 2000s. For a new platform I expected to look more clean and well designed. I experience crashes every now and then but it’s not terrible. I wish there was a way to tell if you finished an episode. And since Disney owns Fox I hope they will eventually have a new tab for Fox content. I’m probably just going to watch what I want for a month or two and drop it then maybe pick it up again in the future if or when things improve."
2020-05-29 16:50:44,OMG LOVING IT,5,har!!!124,False,😃😃😃 I loved that you can watch it on the TVs and it has all the Disney categories even for like toddlers and babies it’s a GRATE thing to have to watch and we all new it but then it got even more amazing you can do it on a tablet or a phone or a computer like yesss Queen and it’s so amazing like when you have a baby bro/sis and they keep on crying because they don’t have anything there’s a little category for the juniors and I love this because it’s a life Saver for me and they can watch it while they’re on a car drive or when your parents are at the store basically anywhere I love this app so much and I know it keeps getting better and better PS. I know it’s tough around these times and I know Disney keeps helping through this  over and over again so thanks from me
2019-11-24 08:20:11,Great content? Terrible product…,1,Whisky Traveler,False,"I’ve seen some of the content available on this app/service and I’m really interested. Unfortunately, it just flat does not work. I signed up for the free trial and a year subscription six days ago. I set up my family’s different profiles, set preferences and added some movies to my watchlist. Since then all I have been able to watch is the famous, but completely unhelpful error message with Ralph and Penelope (on mobile devices) or a spinning blue ring (on the computer.) The “login” button on the website appears to be a dead link, and when you work around to the actual log-in page you get the spinning ring. The app just plain doesn’t work. I hesitate to call something trash that could be great, but I wouldn’t pay a nickel for what I’ve experienced during my free trial. I understand these issue can happen, but it’s been over a week since they went live. Is there any chance that Microsoft is the parent company for Disney? I won’t be subscribing at this rate. Zero stars."
2020-05-26 17:49:24,Great but has many issues...,4,xsunkissedxx,False,"i love disney plus and use it all the time but the app in particular has many issues that should be fixed. first one is missing episodes!!! many shows are missing episodes and the majority of seasons. another problem is many episodes on older shows are out of order. another problem is inaccurate search results. whenever you search for a title, a completely different and unrelated title might show up as well. it just looks weird and out of place. another issue is the app is very buggy. it does not load as fast and the pages for movies load one movie at a time as you scroll down. another problem is inaccurate dates for movies and shows. this isn’t really an issue but it just looks like no one took time to put correct dates in."
2020-01-12 22:09:24,"Good content, badly presented",3,beamformidable,False,"I love having access to all the shows and movies I grew up with, as well as all the recent movies I love. My biggest gripe is how poorly the service has been set up. A lot of the older TV series’ episodes are out of order, or just plainly missing episodes. This doesn’t seem like an issue that should still be going on after the service has been live for a couple months now. Especially when some of the shows were fixed within the first week, and the rest seem to just be getting ignored. I don’t want to have to shuffle around the clunky interface to find the right episode. 

While the amount of content is great and nostalgic, the lack of response to problems has led me to discontinue the service. That and the fact there isn’t much original content currently, but it’s still a new service so I’m sure that will improve over time."
2020-03-05 11:10:51,"Great App, but Questionable Privacy",4,drmong,False,"My two sons(16 & 13) recently got Disney+ little over a month ago. They’ve enjoyed it and watched their favorites. They love it and think it’s good. But the strange thing is that their accounts won’t stay on their phones. My older son opens up his account to only see it’s logged onto his brother’s and neither of them have done edited their profiles. It is automatically there every time he opens the app up. 
   My sons also question the security of the app as they keep getting each other’s watch list. For privacy reasons, I think there has to be an update to secure individuals’ privacy as this malfunction makes my boys curious and a little worried about this minor error. Could Disney try to fix this and does anyone else having this problem? Other than that, Disney+ is great and my boys enjoy it a lot."
2020-04-22 03:05:16,Expected more from app,3,Frustrated drama fan,False,"Autoplay is the main annoyance.  (We use chromecast to TV)
It rolls to the next episode when there are still 2 minutes remaining of the episode, so you miss the end. 
The app also limits some series like Boy Meets World to only 2 episodes, then kick you out to the home screen. You have to search for the series again and select the next episode you want to watch. Then after 2, you get kicked out again. 
Why is there no ‘watched’ indicator on episodes? If you haven’t watched a series for awhile you can’t tell where you left off. 
The ‘continue watching’ list drops programs you were watching after a couple of days.  Apparently, someone at Disney has decided you can only have 4 programs in ‘watching mode’ after 2 days. Why? 
Another unexpected issue is when you stop watching something and return later. (This occurs only when we cast to TV)  We have to start watching where we left off on our iPad and then cast to TV.  If we start the app on the TV and then restart a movie, it puts us back at the beginning. 
Most disappointing, is that Disney knows about these issues. After U.S. launch they quickly added ‘continue watching’ feature based on customer complaints,  but appear to have stopped putting any more effort into making additional improvements."
2020-01-01 07:21:07,Languages available,4,LukasMoreno,False,"Hello Disney Plus, the app is great and have some content from childhood I didn’t think I’d have the pleasure to see again. I was even more pleased when I saw that I could watch a show in Portuguese (Timon and Pumbaa series) to be specific. However, for my disappointment it was Portuguese from Portugal (which has a very different accent) and even different words for the famous songs. I’d think you’d have added the Brazilian translation version of it since the likeliness of someone wanting to watch in Portuguese being a Brazilian vs a Portuguese it’s probably 95% chance to be Brazilian. Please swap to the Brazilian Portuguese translation or add it (as you did in Spanish) with European and the Latino Spanish options, that would be great for most of us who wish we can watch in Portuguese. Thank you, and again the app and context are great!!"
2019-11-19 00:54:01,Love it but it’s missing some thing!,3,Qube7654322,False,I love having all of my old favorites in one spot! I’m letting my kid explore all of the movies that I used to watch and she’s in love with Finding Nemo at the moment. The design is pretty and it’s been working for me with no problems unlike what some people have been saying. I just need it to have a “continue watching list” sometimes I go off and do things with my kid and my Xbox will shut off. I don’t like having to search for what I was watching every time. I need that list. Sometimes I’ll forget that I’m even watching a series and I’d love to have that feature. The second thing is that we don’t have the option to binge watch the series. It might seem minuscule but I have a two year old and if I want to have some mommy time I don’t want to have to come back and push next episode every 5 minutes because she’s watching a series instead of a movie!
2019-11-16 03:43:49,Amazingly well made app,5,BudgetAudiophile,False,"I got the service right when it came out and was extremely excited for the mandalorian. The main reason why I got the service was for the marvel shows, I was a little disappointed with how long it is going to take for the new marvel shows to come out. The first night it came out I did notice that the servers might have been overloaded because it wasn’t allowing me to get into somethings. If someone asked me if they should get Netflix or Disney+ I would say Disney+, the reason why is because it’s cheaper, Netflix will no longer have any sort of Disney movies, and the content is high quality and very entertaining to watch. Overall I would highly recommend this service to any one who needs to find some new shows/movies to watch."
2019-11-12 20:00:12,Needs Improvement,3,Mara2019B,False,"I was very excited to get the app for the content. My son loves everything Disney so this was a must for our family. The app itself is easy to navigate and it’s aesthetic is nice. My only issues are: when setting up a profile for my family, It would not save or show the profiles, so I had to create it again. When I came back to it after a while, I found all the profiles I created and thought weren’t saved there at once, when I tried to delete them, they would still be there. Secondly, the app crashes a lot and it fails to los several times. I checked my internet just to make sure it wasn’t a connection issue, but it was fine. Not sure if this is is a product of everyone using at once since launch, but I hope they do fix it. Its well worth it, but the lagging issues and crashing, make it really hard to experience Disney+."
2020-01-07 08:48:44,Needs a few improvements,4,FlameZone,False,"I’m writing this with hopes that Disney will see it and make the necessary improvements. The app is nicely designed and runs fairly well with the exception of 2 things, both on mobile device (iPhone 7). First, when playing an episode, there is never a pause button when the screen is tapped... just a spinning loading wheel. The only way to pause is to turn off my phone. The other problem is the difficulty leaving an episode or movie. The back arrow at the top left corner of the screen usually takes me 4-5 attempts before the device responds correctly. Most of the time when I tap it, it acts like it would if I were to just touch the middle of the screen, with the spinning loading wheel popping up. Please fix these things. Other than that, great app."
2019-11-18 06:16:03,Love it all!,5,Miss Puppy.,False,"I know, theres no “continue watching” list, but just think! Every show and movie is there again! I’m a big fan of “Jessie” and “The suite life on deck” and “Teen beach”, so to re-see it again is awesome! I love “Disney+” the way it is. Yes, it can be frustrating that you have to research the show or movie your watching, but still, like I said: Every show and movie made by “Disney” is there again. And yes, its MY opinion, some people dont like it, and I will respect that. But hey! I’m just saying its a REALLY great idea in my book! But yeah, I wish everybody would appreciate it because theres SO many shows and movies by “Disney” and people don’t appreciate it or how long it took to take ALL the shows and movies (and theres ALOT) and put it to all one app. So I applaud 👏 to “Disney” and their hard work 😌."
2020-09-14 16:27:53,Need more fixing on some of these problems I’m having,5,nyla4life147,False,"Ok first thing first I love Disney Plus and you know what made me sad the profile picture  options , I like to watch Disney Channel and there is about  particular show I love and it is called “Disney Star vs the Forces of Evil “ , can you add some more of the profile pictures from that show it is from Disney Channel . I just recently updated Disney Plus and I don’t see my history when I finish an episode of  a show, can you guys go back to the  version 1.8.0 please and thank you. Now when I don’t finish a movie or a show it goes away from my continuing watching list as I start something new it moves all the way to the end and goes away please fix these problems please in the next update."
2019-12-28 20:59:47,Amazing selection just one flaw with the UI,4,Mfern6108,False,"So I love the selection of movies and shows, although the UI can sometimes be a little glitchy. Sometimes the pause button is replaced with a with loading symbol like the video is buffering, although the video is just fine. Another problem is that sometimes when I look at different seasons of of show I want to watch it takes a long time to load, and even then some episodes aren’t even there. I do not believe this is my internet because I did not have these issues with other streaming services. All though these are still minor annoyances, the service is still completely worth it, I just want the developers to work these issues out (yes I know this service just launched but Disney has the money to fix it instantly)."
2019-11-18 00:50:36,Lots of issues,1,agiesm00,False,"I’ve been watching Disney+ on my FireTV and the content is incredible but it’s missing a continue watching feature, a lot of movies shown to be on the service won’t actually be available for a few months-a year and when I tried logging on on my laptop (it’s compatible I checked) the log in button wasn’t responsive so I tried going straight to the log in URL and it wouldn’t load. Additionally, when I downloaded the app on my phone (also compatible) it wouldn’t accept the email I provided, even though it’s the correct email and didn’t have any mistakes. I understand that they had a lot more people purchase a subscription than they thought would, however, they already had multiple streaming services to model it after yo flaws in the actual service itself shouldn’t be present. On top of that, if people can’t log in they’re going to get frustrated after a while and unsubscribe 🤷🏼‍♀️ hopefully these issues get resolved soon."
2019-11-17 22:39:11,I love it!,5,Lilian1010184,False,"When I first heard about it I was so excited. I was happy to watch all my favorite childhood shows and movies. I finally got the app and I’m so happy! A few things though, number one, I would watch a show and then get out of it when I’m done, but when I go back to watch more it just plays from the first episode again. Number two, I would like an area to where it shows all my movies and shows that I’m watching. I’m a forgetful person and sometimes I’ll forget what I’m watching and where I left off. I know it just launched so I knew there will be some bugs that will need to be fixed. Lastly, I’m so happy that I get to watch all these amazing shows and movies. I’m excited for future updates and more shows and movies to be put on. 

Thank you :)"
2019-11-15 22:48:25,Finally,5,a delko,False,I have been waiting forever for this app.  It’s even better than I thought. The only issue was when I first tried to sign up it kept giving me an error message and when I typed my email to try signing in it said it wasn’t available in all regions.  I expect some issues though because it was only hours after it launched.  I wanted a few hours abd it let me sign up.  I had expected it to be more of a pain than it was. I have been using it since and have hit no more issues.  It’s a great app and so worth leaving Netflix for.  It is also a lot cheaper.  There are more options and no restrictions.  The only thing that could make it better would be to know what we’ve watched already and what was started and not finished.
2019-11-21 04:16:29,"Love Disney, not the app.",3,princesskoko23,False,"I purchased the app a few days after the release date, as it would not let me start a free trial and when I tried to just purchase the subscription directly but it would not allow me to purchase. Once I was finally able to purchase the app it would not connect to the the internet and I could not watch anything on my iPhone. I also downloaded the app onto my 2019 Sony smart TV, the same problem occurred. I figured this was happening because so many people were purchasing the subscription. The reason I’m writing this review is that it’s still having these issues this late after the release date. I am still unable to connect to the internet although all my devices and other apps are connected to the internet and are working perfectly. Please resolve this matter so I can enjoy all the memories of my childhood."
2019-11-14 06:09:16,So much potential,3,Didiamoor,False,This app has so much potential but it’s expectedly still glitchy . All the shows and movies are amazing and it was so nostalgic going through it all. However... why can’t I select a single genre/type and go view solely that category ? It lets you scroll trough a few selections in a single category (scroll to the left) maybe ten selections or so and then it just stop . You can’t press on the category name and the only way I seem to be able see more options is when I press on one selection and see additional content on the bottom under “recommendations “. It also did t save my spot in two of the shows I was watching so when I went back to them today it started at episode 1 and didn’t even have the episodes already watched checked off. anyways I’m sure it will get better and I’m looking forward to updating my review.
2020-09-06 21:23:31,Disney+ is the absolute best!!!,5,Worst. Game. I. Ever. Had.,False,"I got the subscription last year, and trust me when I say this, I did not regret it for 1 second. I did have a problem with Disney+ a couple of months ago because it would freeze the second I opened it. Of course, a new update can out and fixed that problem. Also they’re are trying to make more money by adding this premier access thing. But I don’t blame them. #1 Nobody goes to the movie theatre, and normally it casts $50 just to let 2 people watch it, and now you can watch it with as many people as you want. #2 once you pay $30 once, all the upcoming premier access movies will be free. #3 I bet all of you guys would make 50 different types of premier access just to make money. So I loves Disney+"
2020-03-25 18:30:26,Good but bad,5,this app needs more,False,So to start with I think this app is really good and has good movies and really good organizations to find a movie you wanna watch for example like comedy. So now we can get to the bad part of it. I know this might be new to the developer but I really think it need more improvements. I do know that your are working on things but as a right now I just don’t feel it. You can put the small un- good movies but can’t put the good ol movies that people wanna watch? Not a lot of people wanna watch those newest movies such as like live action. But I really was looking forward to the live action Cinderella and beauty and the beast but now I have to wait until 2021 for the Cinderella live action and October 1st for beauty and the beast. It bothers me because not all the goods are on there.
2019-12-04 18:51:50,Love it!!!,4,fordmwg84,False,"I have been enjoying Disney+ since it launched a month ago. It has tons of movies and shows all on one app. I have enjoyed reliving my childhood by watching the old classic Disney cartoons along with the classic animation movies. Only reason I did not give it a five star is there are a few glitches and bugs Disney needs to work out. I have been watching it on my PS4. While watching a show or movie, the picture would freeze but audio keeps going. Other times you would be watching and it would fast forward a couple of scenes and you would have to rewind and sometimes that would freeze the app. You would have to close the app and reopen when this happens. All in all, I have enjoyed Disney+. I just hope that the next few updates will fix some of these bugs and glitches."
2019-11-14 13:36:58,Not available in a majority of countries around the world,4,Pasha102601,False,"From what Ive heard the app is good. It does have a few bugs and issues but it’s good. I have to say that I personally wish the app was available in all countries around the world preferably in the same year as it is released in United States. 
I wish that the Mandalorian, Clone Wars seventh season along with other Disney + TV shows were available to download for a reasonable price (usually between 30-40 US dollars per season) on ITunes Store and I wish they were available soon. 
Personally I would love to buy The Clone Wars Season 7 instead of paying hundreds of US dollars it s just not consumer friendly to say the least. It is very sad to see that the majority of the world can’t see Disney + TV shows and films majority of which fans have been waiting for a really long time."
2019-12-07 20:18:11,Worth it...but bugs,4,travie_mac,False,"Disney+ is everything I thought it would be! It has everything from my childhood plus a lot of the new projects they’ve put out with more coming in the near future. However, there are bugs I have noticed...one being it seems to only allow you to add a certain amount in your watchlist and once you’ve reached that limit, the list repeats from the top and then ends. The page on the certain movie or show will say it’s in your watchlist, but when you go to the watchlist page, it’s not there. I’ve also noticed that it doesn’t add everything, you can click add but it bugs and ends up not adding it. I still love the app with access to all those Disney projects, just waiting for the bugs to be worked out. Completely worth it in the long run!!"
2019-11-13 20:49:36,Great content but still has issues,3,Hothdweller,False,"We got Disney plus and we are on day two of the streaming service. Day one was plagued with issues of not being available but by the end of the day it all seemed resolved. Today is showing buffering issues every 10-15 seconds both on the TV and on mobile. On first look the service seems generic. The search does not work very well until you get the exact search strung gets put in. Also there service does not pick up where you left off. I had to leave in the middle of a show and came back and the show started over. Not a huge deal as the fast forward seems to work well. As previously mentioned, day twos major issue seems to be a buffering issue. I have tried both on ISP and over mobile and have the same experience. Hopefully by day three we will have the major kinks worked out."
2020-01-03 03:48:00,VERY IMPORTANT READ!!,5,Cesar lopezzzzzz,False,Do not share your password with anyone!! Unless you 100% sure they won’t share it with anyone. I shared my account with couple people thinking nothing of it until someone shared it and it kept getting shared and someone started deleting the accounts and messing with my account.. I changed the password thinking it would make everyone have to log back in but that’s not the case everyone will still be logged in and there’s no feature to boot people off your account so i talked to someone from customer support and one agent told me one thing and the second time I talked to someone else they told me completely different thing so my point is don’t share your password because I can’t even enjoy Disney right now
2019-12-09 10:54:25,Downloads but won’t share,2,A Good Grandson,False,"I got this app specifically for the ability to download content to my phone then later share it to my [samsung] television later. 

I would stream direct to my tv except that like everyone else I like to watch shows during normal (peak) evening hours AND I have satellite internet. So, my direct streaming experience has been mostly watching at 5am or watching a load screen every 12 seconds. Frustrating!!

So, I did some reading and found that I could (supposedly) download to my phone then airplay to my tv. However, that’s not really how it works...after having airplay freezing/studdering issues, waiting 1-1/2 hrs to chat with Disney about it (they didn’t), go half-nuts thinking it was an issue with my phone, tv or WiFi setup, I finally disconnected my internet modem and VOILA! It didn’t work at all!!! 

What seems to be going on is; Yes, you can download content to your phone or tablet at lower than 4K/ultraHD definition and you can watch on your phone or tablet just fine. BUT when you attempt to cast content to a smart tv, the tv doesn’t play the cast download but instead streams direct from Disney in HD. Apparently Disney has decided that they’d rather you didn’t see their content on a tv than allow you to view it in low def. 

In other words, Disney doesn’t want customers who don’t have the best internet speed."
2019-12-30 04:04:52,"Great content, poor usability",4,VBard1,False,"Let’s brush past the obvious: the content is great. Classic and new Disney movies and tv shows, literally everyone in the family from my 2-year old kid to my 75-year old grandma has something they want to watch. 

The other positive (as of writing) is the app lets you download a LOT of content for offline viewing; which was a lifesaver recently for a long family trip. Each family member got a decent selection they could enjoy on the road.

The major drawback is the video viewing experience: it is just not up to the standards of a Netflix or Prime Video app. Auto-playing a series, quick rewinding or fast forwarding, etc. are glitchy. In offline mode, some of these features just don’t work. Hopefully they fix these bugs soon; that will make this app a real winner."
2019-11-18 02:14:32,Disney please read this.,5,Jéssie Sarilho,False,"I just really want to thank all involved in this accomplishment. I feel amazed to be part of this mark in history, screaming on the morning of November 12th just because it was the day. Going so excited to open Disney+ and actually having trouble, spending a good amount of time trying to figure it out and them when all was fixed, spending hours watching Disney Channel shows that I grew up watching and that I couldn’t find anywhere else years before. 
The reason why I am writing this here is simply because I was looking at the movies catalog and it gives me so, so much joy that everything you could possibly want to see again (or for the first time) is there. 
I am truly happy with Disney+ 
It is just so, Disney!"
2019-11-26 01:35:18,PLEASE fix this app! We are PAYING customers!,4,FreddysNotDead4115,False,"Everything on my watchlist is on their twice, and when I add things others start to disappear. It’s super annoying scrolling through my watch list and seeing things repeat, while others are nowhere to be found. I had to remove a bunch of stuff I just added so I didn’t have to go searching for things that were at the bottom of my list aka ones I added first. And that’s another problem, when I add things I never know if they’ll be at the very top or very bottom of my list. And why isn’t there a section where we can see what we’ve already watched, I’d like to be able to continue where I left off as soon as I open the app, instead of having to go to my watchlist and look for the show or movie I want to continue."
2019-11-14 01:14:17,I love it but have one complaint.,4,CheyeeneCS,False,I absolutely love Disney plus. All the good movies and shows that I love watching. They also have stuff from my parents generation that they can enjoy. There is also no adds during any shows which is a great thing as far as streaming services go. So far I haven’t had any glitches which is a positive. The only complaint I have is that there are several movies that I was looking forward to watching on the service are unavailable until 2020 or 2021. I looked up one film and it said that “due to agreements this film will be available till april of 2021”. I looked up another and said “unavailable till december of 2020.” Why are they making us wait so long just to put several of their own products on their brand new service?? They need to do something about that.
2019-11-25 14:30:38,Great when it works,3,Bjbjbjbjbj92,False,"I’ve got mixed feelings for the app. Mostly good though- I haven’t experienced any tech issues with the app from my phone, so great when we’re out and about for my little one. At home, streaming the app on the tv is a headache and takes forever. When it decides to upload , none or some of the pictures are there for movie or show selection. And then when you click on the choice, it may or may not give you a okay option. Sometimes you click on it and nothing appears. Or it just spins and spins. It’s not a WiFi issue as this is the only app I have issues with. As far as the content that’s on the app, I can only say great things!! I’m thrilled my son can watch all the classics from my childhood (and even my mom’s) plus all the newest material. I’m looking forward to an update for tech reasons but aside from that, I think it’s a cool app."
2019-11-14 02:41:42,True Imagineering,5,dk dave,False,"On the day of launch I found some glitches. (which is bound to happen being it’s the 1st day it was open to the public) Here is some I found: The play button would not display nor did the episodes, loading times were pretty big. Honestly I’m not even mad about it because this is pretty much every Disney movie on 1 app for a really cheap price, you couldn’t really ask for more. Regarding the glitches, within a couple hours Disney updated the app and the glitches were fixed faster than you can say Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious. In the end, Disney+ is true hard work of imagineering. Congrats to Disney on such a wonderful accomplishment, I cannot wait to see what Disney+ has in store for the future. 👍🏻😁"
2020-08-01 20:59:58,Needs notifications,4,mattco121,False,I love it. It is a well-made app Best I’ve seen so far only one problem you don’t seem to have any notification settings and you don’t send any notifications that is a thing that I rely on when you’re sending out new movies or removing movies from Disney+. And I’m sure some people also have the same issue with there being no notifications I would like to see this added. And several people know that you remove things from Disney+ I don’t know why but you do one of those things that you removed is pirates of the Caribbean stranger tides but that isn’t exactly a problem I just wanted you to send a notification when it was removed so if you could kindly work on that I’m sure a lot of people would be thankful. thank you for reading this review.
2020-09-05 00:38:10,aMazInG,5,Mimilove CANDYEATER,False,"This app is absolutely amazing  I love it especially since there is the new Mulan on it, it’s an amazing app because the controls on my iPad allow me to keep watching in the corner of my screen other than that I just love almost everything about it...but there Is one minor issue, if you are reading this I definitely still recommend this app but just know, I have downloaded many things before, and after a hour they just disappear. Disney, if your reading this comment I hope you fix that, because my family travels a lot and plane WiFi doesn’t always make the cut, we all know what I mean by that, but I still love this app I would donate money to improve that download issue...that is, if I had the money."
2019-11-19 00:10:49,Disney as usual,4,JRandall69,False,"The app is as I expected from Disney. Disney does one thing and they do it better than anyone else, Entertainment. With that being said, there are some short falls. As many have said, a keep watching tab with the ability to resume a show would be awesome. I got cut off the other night and then had to scroll to find my place again in the movie. Also, since we’re possibly downloading these to a mobile device, how about the size of the movie or episode you’re wanting to download. If that is there somewhere, I didn’t see it. It’d be nice to know how big the file was. Lastly and sadly, not ALL content is available. One of my favorite Disney movies, Johnny Tremain, is absent. Song of the South, Tex, just a few that I’ve noticed. Whether it be political incorrectness or oversight, I miss those."
2020-03-29 16:50:51,"Great content, but terrible app!",2,Mr. Godeaux,False,"The content is great, but they removed some stuff which is disappointing. The app however is a totally different story. I’m having issues with my kids watching something on their profiles then it showing up on my profile as a continue watching which is very frustrating and inconvenient. It effects the suggestions. The app could be made much easier to navigate. When trying to watch it on my TV if we don’t have exceptions internet connection it won’t even work, but Netflix and every other streaming platform has no issue. I’m currently under a free year from Verizon, but if thing don’t change drastically I WILL NOT pay for it once that free year is up. I love the concept of all of Disney’s content being streamable, but it really feels like they’re much more focused on the dollar than the consumer. It’s quite disappointing from one of our most beloved companies!"
2019-11-18 08:19:06,Love Disney+!!,4,EpicUsernameMan,False,"I am absolutely loving Disney+! I love being able to watch all the old Disney Channel shows I grew up with as a kid. I love being able to watch all my Star Wars & Marvel movies in one place, well most anyway. However, I will recommend a couple improvements for the next update such as a recently watched section right at the top like Netflix does so that I can pick up where I last left off rather than having to search for it. Also with watching movies on Disney+, I sometimes don’t finish a movie in one sitting and so it is quite annoying when coming back to the movie and it is not where I last watched it. I have to then go and fast forward to where I was again. It would be great in the next update that I don’t have to do that. Other than those two, I love the new Disney+!"
2019-11-17 13:57:58,some tweaks but other wise i love it,4,😎😎😎😍😎😎😎,False,"Disney plus is a great app definitely worth all $7.00 ever month. But, I just wish there was a continue watching section because at some point your going to exit out of the app and forget what movie or show you where watching. I would love that just so it’s easier to find. Otherwise I don’t think I have a problem with this app. And I would recommend disney plus more than netflix because I enjoy disney anything. But, if your more into netflix just because you might not like disney for any reason I recommend netflix. also this is for disney: I’ve been so excited to download this app and it exceeded my expectations again the only thing i would add if i had a choice was continue watching section. Thank You for reading my report have a good day."
2019-11-16 15:09:15,Just a few Suggestions!,4,Elly Bennet,False,"Overall, Disney+ has been AMAZING! I’m loving getting to rewatch all the shows I used to watch as a kid. I only have a few suggestions on how to make it better, which I’m sure have already been said. First, a Continue Watching list would be suuuuch a huge improvement. Additionally, if I go to a series, there needs to be a way of seeing which episodes I’ve already watched, so I know where I left off. Finally, I know most of the TV shows are older, but the quality of some of them feel less than ideal to watch. They’re definitely not the best quality videos I’ve watched recently, and I don’t know if this is because they’re older, if my iPad is just messing up, or if the video quality is purposely somewhat low. These are my thoughts and suggestions. Thanks!"
2020-01-11 21:15:57,Can't pause!,4,queenking👍,False,"I've been using Disney Plus on my IPhone/IPad, and although it's fine on the Roku, there is one or two problems on my IOS devices that I've noticed.
1) If I try to rewind/fast forward, I can do it, but after I do, there is a loading sign on the pause button, so I can't pause without backing out the show/movie or tapping the progress bar. This is only when I tap to go back or forward on the pause screen, not the progress bar.
2) Sometimes when I rewind, it glitches and brings me back to the main screen, so I have to click on the show again. It's really annoying if I'm watching a movie or binging a show because it cuts into the movie/show.

Other than that, I love this app. Watching all my favorite old shows and rewatching original favorites is really rewarding."
2020-02-08 06:25:25,No complaints,5,crazyindian95,False,I have had it since it came out! And I love it! I hv u guys for the heartfelt memories I’ve grown up too! I keep Netflix for the scary stuff I grew up with and also love the news stuff. But I am now in the middle of watching 2of a many fav tv shows o. Disney channel. Wizards of waverly place. And Lizzie miguire. And hv watched so many of my favorite movies! I was a 90’s kid! So all of these movies I grew up watching. Can’t play my vhs tapes anymore and don’t have them all on vhs. I haveALOT but not all of them! So happy to have Disney plus! Just brings me back to watching them as a kid and getting excited to see the movies I loved back then now. A great way to escape reality and go back to the best years of my life watching the movies I loved whenever I want! Thank you for this Disney!!
2020-01-01 23:42:07,Worth it,4,Kyla M7,False,"I love this app. I love Disney so much, but I have run into a few problems while using the app. On any device... the movies and tv shows skip a whole lot.. it’s almost like I’m watching a movie on a very scratched up cd.. is very annoying and eventually I get really tired of it so I have to just leave it all together. I’ve had issues with it slipping and it backing out of what I’m watching several times. Other than these issues which I really hope will be resolved I love Disney plus a lot... I would really hate to quit using it because of this problem, and I know it’s not a connection error because my WiFi is amazing and have never had a problem with it. New shoes and movies would be great but I’m sure that will come later on down the road 😊 other than that I love it so much ♥️"
2019-11-22 06:34:52,Please Fix Watchlist,4,50 Million tries,False,"With Disney+ you’ll be able to watch every movie or show (with some exceptions) that Disney made or owns. It’s a long nostalgic trip and brings joy to movie streaming. There are some issues with the app, however. The watchlist has a major glitch where if you add to many movies, it seems, it will take off a couple and duplicate the ones already on it. I wish there was a way to edit the watchlist as well. 

In certain instances, Disney+ is ahead of big streaming companies, but in other instances there seem to be certain luxuries missing. For example, a “continue watching” list or “recently watched”. 

The app NEEDS to be polished. Get the app, obviously, cause it’s cool to watch all the movies and shows you did as a kid, just expect glitches, as it is still a young streaming service."
2019-12-08 17:42:03,Subtitles off,5,home in AZ,False,"We love Disney + it’s great to have the classics available as well as all the new fun movies. We watch many of our movies with the subtitles on because of hearing problems and have found that the subtitles are a few seconds ahead of what is happening and being said. This can ruin a movie with a surprise coming. The words appear a full 5-7 seconds before someone says the line. Please adjust this. Also, rewinding with the PS4 has some glitches as well. Usually works ok, but sometimes loses its place. And another thing, there are times when the video stops but the sound continues. I first thought it may be due to internet connection speeds, but I don’t have these issues with any other streaming app. Thank you."
2019-12-01 06:41:27,Amazing selection/major casting issues,2,Morgan.E.,False,"First off, I love everything that is offered though Disney +. It has even more than I ever thought it would. Every disney channel original I can think of is offered, which is definitely my favorite feature. The biggest problem is the downloading and buffering issues. When I’m casting a movie or show, the app will stop to buffer almost every five minutes minimum, sometimes being stopped for long periods of time. I just finished a movie that was 1 hr 39 min and counted the number of times it stopped to buffer... 34 times..... in less than 2 hours. It’s awful. I’ve tried casting other apps such as Netflix to rule out any slow signal/bad connection on my end, but Disney + is the only one that seems to struggle. I’m not sure if this is something that can be improved on their end, but it makes it less tempting to subscribe further until something fixes it."
2019-11-17 02:06:40,Perfect but not perfect,4,this nickname won't work,False,"I got Disney Plus a few days ago and it has so much to like but so much to dislike as well. First the TV shows are great! The Star Wars one is amazing and they have every episode of the Simpsons. The movies are amazing with almost every Star Wars movie, loads of marvel movies including Endgame, and lots more. But some of the problems include not showing what you have watched which is annoying if you watch multiple things at once. Also if you have already watched most of the movies and finished the shows there is really nothing to do but wait for new movies or more episodes. Overall Netflix is better, shows you what your watching, a wider range of movies/shows, and is easier to locate things. If Disney improved these things in the future this could easily top Netflix."
2019-11-17 12:44:14,Disappointed but okay,3,Total Cycle Baby,False,"I’m a little disappointed with the app because you can add things to your watchlist but never find your actual watch list, you don’t have a currently watching area to allow easy access to whatever show or movie we last watched making it harder to get to, there’s no way of telling what episode you have or haven’t watched and there’s no progress bar at the bottom of the shows or movies when you find them meaning you have to try and remember which episode you left off on. While these are all things that I really dislike about the app, I do enjoy being able to go back into my childhood and rewatch old shows that haven’t been anywhere for a really long time. I know that the app just launched so a lot of things still need to be worked out, but I’m hoping that these will get fixed soon."
2019-11-14 18:12:29,Great material but needs some changes,4,Jahaaha,False,"I am truly impressed with how much is offered on the app. It’s great to be reminded of a lot of my childhood favorites. 

One major flaw that is not on here, would be a “continue watching” feature. I’ve been getting pretty frustrated with trying pick back up where I left off on a show or movie and after a few hours, it starting me completely back over to ‘episode 1, season 1’. Also, having to search for what I was just watching or scrolling all the way through. I noticed that if an episode was done and I hit the back button, it sent me back to the home page and would have to start my search process over instead of just taking me to the episodes of what I was just watching. 

Hopefully something that will change soon."
2019-11-23 20:38:36,Great... but missing some stuff,4,iByers,False,"The amenities that are missing are a “currently watching” section, an option to edit the way closed captions appear (big one). Also when you start a series and stop, the headline doesn’t tell you what episode you left on - in case you’d like to know. Another is being able to skip to the next episode as you’re watching rather than leaving the whole screen. You also can’t ‘subscribe’ to any of the shows you watch that come out weekly. 

I’m excited for all the content I haven’t been able to watch since I was a kid. Seeing all these shows and movies in one place was quite overwhelming.  

I expected to be annoyed at the executive choice of having some of the Disney+ shows come out on a weekly basis but I ended up being unbothered."
2019-11-14 20:55:43,"Great service, great content, but...",4,xander10123,False,"I love everything that is available with the service.
It is full nostalgia with classic cartoons from the 90’s that we loved dearly. Along with live action Disney Channel original series/movies.
BUT... the only issue is there is no way to mark things that were already watched. When logging in you are given the same opening window, and have to search for what you want to watch , and then sift through the episodes and hope you remember which ones you’ve already watched. This, I’m sure, is an issue for a lot of people, and tbh easily fixable. I do not doubt that this fix will come with one of the next few updates. 
This would be a 5* app, however the issue mentioned above is what pulls it down to a 4* (technically would give it a 4.5)."
2019-11-13 23:34:24,Great app,5,thikid,False,"I have Disney plus on my tv and on my iPhone and it works great both places. I love Disney and a lot of people like it, and it is taking over the world with how many people watch it. I love how all the movies that Disney ever posted is in there and all the channels they own like National Geographic, marvel, Disney jr, Disney channel. And some more. The reason people where saying there was glitching was because it was one of the first days Disney plus was out and some many people where logging in and on it that it glitched. I love watching movies and having a worm blanket and popcorn it this app is the perfect app to watch your movies and you don’t even have to go to movies anymore. This person who designed this is the best person in the world. LOVE THIS APP 
Get this app it is so good. “"
2020-02-13 05:46:58,Some really frustrating UI design,3,Rocky7302,False,"First want to say that this is a review on the app interface itself and not the service. Love the content I can find on here. 

This app is really frustrating to navigate on Apple TV. When jumping out of an episode, say because you realize it’s not the episode you left off of or want to watch a prior episode....the app will show a screen that doesn’t let me navigate between all the episodes available. I only get an option to “Play” or “play from beginning” and “add to watchlist”. There’s no way to immediately see the episode list and jump between episodes. Really hope this gets worked out. Constantly find myself having to jump out of the app, and jump between episodes in the Apple TV app which lists the episodes and then directly links to the episode I want to view in the app."
2019-12-10 07:43:09,"Great Start, but Netflix",2,Memyselfandiaremanuel,False,"This is an awesome app with incredible potential and awesome content. However, little details like NOT being able to see the time on my phone when I tap the screen while I watch something and knowing that some shows that Disney made are still missing like the Tarzan show makes me have doubts if I want to pursue Disney+ instead of Netflix. Thank you for the tiny Mandalorian show with baby Yoda, and thank you for bringing back Tron Uprising, but you need to expand the Disney Universe if you want to beat Netflix and AT&T’s platform in market share because you made Netflix king. God Bless Disney and hope for the continuation of old shows that ended without a proper conclusion. 

Netflix is about to have Avatar the Last Airbender while Disney gets a Mulan without Mushu or even getting down to business, so prepare yourselves, Nickelodeon and Cartoonetwork might take the fight to Disney and they were great competitors."
2019-11-19 03:49:01,Almost ready,3,KilCrowley,False,"This app and streaming service has the potential to be great. 
What’s missing:
1. Status indicators: Did you start and episode or movie and finish it? Best remember because Disney isn’t giving you any visual clue as to what episodes you’ve watched. My toddler loves Mickey’s clubhouse, every time I launch it I have to remember which episode she left off on and where in that episode she may have been. I almost always launch an episode that was at the end. Give me some visual clues!
A progress bar on the episode preview is a good start. 

2. Changing the “play episode” button to a “resume episode” button after a show/movie has been launched. Again, visual indication that something has happened here before. 

3. “Recently watched” category: every time I go back to something I’m currently watching I have to either search for it or hope I remembered to put it in my watch list. Simple solution would be to put it in the main screen. 

These are very basic expected behaviors for a streaming service and make for a good user experience. They should’ve been there at launch. Hopefully they’ll arrive soon. You don’t have to reinvent the wheel, especially when your content is guaranteed to be good. Give the users standard functions and they’ll stay happy."
2020-03-16 07:48:11,"Amazing app, a few issues",3,Caylen7719,False,"I absolutely love disney, and this app is truly amazing and great but there seem to be a few problems. i have is downloaded on my ipad and i’ve put a bunch of movies and shows into my watch later list... but whenever i go into it it will only show me not even 1/3 of the shows or movies i have saved so i end up having to look them up. Even when i go to my TV i have the same issue. Another issue i’m having is when i try to add certain movies or shows to the watch later list it won’t let me. I’ll get the little check saying it’s saved but then it isn’t showing up in the list...so when i go back to the movie or show, it has the + sign again to add it as if i hadn’t yet. it’s very frustrating but not intolerable. Just wish it would be fixed soon, i love the app and hate the frustration."
2019-11-15 00:58:12,WONDERFUL WORLD!!  Except...,3,Jayhawks Rule!,False,"THE WATCHLIST NEEDS TO BE ON THR HOME SCREEN, WITH A CONTINUE WATCHING FOR...(user name).  I’m an adult with no children, but I’m really excited about traveling back in time to watch my Disney favorites...BUT PLEASE MAKE THIS EASY TO DO!!!  After making this slight improvement, this will easily be 5 stars!!  I just don’t want to hunt down what I was previously watching. 

ALSO, THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT!!  When I go into the episodes of a series I’m watching, just like other sites do, mark off which episodes I’ve watched, and which one I’m currently on.  If I have 4 or 5 series I’m watching, I don’t want to have to try and remember what episode I’m on for each one.  This is an absolute must.  I just watched The Simpsons Season 1 Episode 1 last night, but there’s no recognition that I have watched that episode and that I’m now ready for Season 1 Episode 2.  As they say on Star Trek, “Make it so!”  Please.  0>)"
2020-05-01 19:18:20,Amazing!,4,Master at real Monopoly,False,"My family and I are BIG fans of Disney! Disney + allows us all to watch Disney whenever we want, wherever you want! It has so many amazing movies, TV shows, and shorts. It includes Disney, Marvel, Pixar, National Geographic, and Star Wars. It has so many amazing movies and TV shows to chose from, some where you can only watch on Disney +. It even includes Disney Channel original movies and TV shows, however I would like to see more episodes and seasons of them, because some Disney Chanel episodes and seasons are not on the app. Also, I would like to see more TV shows in general, I really enjoyed High School Musical the Series, and Diary of a Future President, so more shows like those would make this app even better! However I still love the app, and it’s an overall great Disney experience!"
2020-09-03 04:43:36,Highly counterintuitive,1,Codename_Churchil,False,"This is easily the worst streaming service I’ve used. Every time I try to watch something that isn’t Disney + original programming it will freeze until I close and reopen the app roughly every 10-20 minutes (not just on my phone, on my TV and laptop too). This has happened every time I’ve used the service without fail since I got it in December. Sometimes my devices will randomly log me out and I have to log back in but other times I’ll have trouble logging out. The user interface is fine, but once you’ve found something to watch, it will inevitably crash after 10 minutes. There isn’t enough good original content to keep me interested and while the backlog stuff is pretty good, I can’t watch it without having some kind of technical glitch. This is definitely just Disney trying to ride the streaming train and they clearly don’t put much effort into it outside of the original content."
2019-12-08 14:46:05,"Worth the money, but a few suggestions...",4,CoyoteJammer,False,"Okay, let me get this straight, I love Disney+. It’s great to be able to download movies & TV shows for on-the-go viewing, a feature I have used plenty. However, it was kind of disappointing to find out that I can’t screenshot the movies. As a photo editor I was really looking forward to conveniently being able to find the right poses, facial expressions, and backgrounds from several of my favorite Star Wars characters, especially those from the Clone Wars. I get that this may be mandatory for a Disney+ exclusive such as the Mandalorian, but for other shows like the Clone Wars, that have been around for a while, it seems more like an inconvenience than anything. This is mostly why I bought the app. Nevertheless, it’s still a good app. Would recommend."
2020-04-01 16:42:24,Disney+,5,NSAAAG,False,"Hello and I love the content and I think it is good. I just think that you should make Disney+ Originals more and I think you should have some more adult-like content and add some stuff that is more for mature kids. It’s a great platform, it’s just focused for kids and I think that you should do other things and add things like comedians and other. It would be cool to make some other thing like cartoons. You need to get things like onward and other things. Everyone is under lockdown and onward was only out for a little amount of time. I have loading issues on my Samsung tv but it might just be the tv cause it’s really buggy and slow. I love everything right know but some stuff should be put on it and more often. DONE."
2019-12-07 22:44:28,Disney+ is worthless,1,Psuche01,False,"This Disney+ app, just like ESPN, is worthless. I pay for a subscription to Disney+ and was able to watch one episode of a show on my home personal use TV via lightning to HDMI adapter. The next episode I’m presented with an error. Come to find out the Disney family feels it isn’t making enough money so it has become their policy to block the Lightning to HDMI connection. Considering I was purchasing this for the sole purpose to use for my personal family use and the fact that my choice of display size is being refused by the app I’m extremely disappointed and will cancel my subscription and recommend to everyone I know not waste their time or money on this very limited use worthless app. I find it very interesting that other apps I have a paid subscription to allow use of any size monitor I choose for my use via the Lightning to HDMI adapter and this app has prohibited my use of this option. Unbelievable and completely dissatisfied."
2019-11-29 22:25:30,"Good content; buggy, basic app",4,JM6977,False,"The content makes Disney+ well worth it, but the app leaves a lot to be desired. While it’s possible to make different profiles, and for those profiles to have there own watch lists, it was not intuitive how to set up either, and finding the watch list is hard. There’s also not a watch queue, so if you’re watching different series it’s hard to know where you are in them. I’ve also noticed that the “Continue watching” button rarely works, and just starts the episode/movie over from the beginning. Finally, the currently watching screen only shows series information, not episode, so it’s not possible to know what episode you’re on if you’ve forgotten. All that being said, generally having a good experience."
2019-11-28 18:25:10,Some suggestions,4,gglove1,False,"Was overly excited when I saw the shows and movies you could watch on here although I do have some issues. 
I have the google chrome connected to my TV and I’m able to cast Disney Plus from my phone. My problem is is that it seems to stop playing and buffer every couple of minutes. But on our other TV that I was able to download the app onto, I don’t have that problem, so I know it isn’t a WiFi issue. 
The other thing is when it comes to me casting it from my phone, it only allows two episodes to play before it goes back to the Disney “casting” screen. Which again, isn’t a problem on the other TV which has the app downloaded. I’m not sure if I’m the only one having these issues but overall love the app and the content!"
2019-11-17 03:18:39,The app is not there yet.,4,paulovsouza,False,"Disney+ as a service is awesome. Disney+ app.. 

All the beloved content, nostalgic feels, music sing alongs, beloved characters, hidden gems, it’s all here in one app. New content is on its way, but the content that’s there is so expansive it will hold you over for future project. 

Now the app, super basic, which is cool, makes things simple. However lots of functionality you expect from a stream app is not there. Had to step away, and want to hop back into your movie or show... you can’t. You have to add it to your watch list before hand. Good luck if you’re watching a show. You have to be lucky enough to remember what episode you were on, most times it starts your over from episode 1. Searching through the content, not search when you know what you looking for, but ease of finding things to watch is pretty difficult. There should be more categories, make it easier to find things, not just the “top picks” or “Pixar”. Navigation seems to be a little clunky, fast forwarding feels off.. where I rather just have it play out. 

Disney+ is a must have streaming service, especially if you’re a Disney fan. If you’re a fan of streaming, it’s just not fully there yet."
2019-11-25 02:54:27,"Great content, but lacking functionality",4,MikesMommie,False,"I wish I could give a 4.5 because I absolutely love the content and even the way it’s categorized. The throwback section is my favorite! Being able to watch all my favorite childhood shows is everything I thought it would be and more! I love Gargoyles even more as an adult and the new content like Lady and the Tramp, however we could really use a “continue watching” section. I’m not one to pay attention to episode names and if I binge I lose track of the number, so the fact that every time I log in, I have to search for the show again, then scroll through seasons, and again through episodes is annoying. I love the app overall and adding that would be the cherry on top of an already satisfying treat."
2020-09-13 02:38:49,Disney+ is 👍🏻👍🏻,5,PianoPlayer07,False,"Disney+ is soooo great def a five star! I do have a suggestion, could y’all add Liv and Maddie, because that’s not on there and Bunk’d isn’t either? I def love disney+! It has a lot of good content. It has something for everybody! Oh, I have one more suggestion, add the second season of Sydney to the Max . If y’all could do that developers would be great!  

UPDATE:
Still loving disney+❤️❤️ and o my word y are people making a big deal out of nothing? Ppl! Seriously, One little bug on the app and you leave a bad review. I mean it if it glitches one time, or sometimes, it’s OK. Just fix what u were doing and move on! And if it keeps happening tell the developers. Email them. Do something about it. Anyway..... I def recommend disney+ to ANYBODY and EVERYBODY."
2020-08-10 18:45:00,A few problems,1,Banana Cake:),False,"So great app but sometimes it takes like 5 minutes to load the rest of the episode even if connection is good. Also when it says Something Went Wrong it resets my progress on the episode and then when I fast forward  to where I was it buffers like crazy. You should be able to download shows instead of individually downloading each and every episode . When I search something like Anime or something it shows stuff that have Anime in the title and not actual Anime shows and movies. Whenever the shows are done buffering sometimes the audio quality get worse. Occasionally when the intro for the show comes the skip intro button doesn’t pop up, so then I have to fast forward and like I already said that makes it buffer. Also when I just click nowhere near the back button it exits me out of the show occasionally erasing my progress on the episode. Fix these and I will give 5 stars."

When I use the app. It never ever picks up my show or movie where I last left off. I always have to find my place and it takes forever to load when I move it Back to its last place.
The casting from my phone to my tv is glitchy and it leaves these invisible like squares and rectangles. Then it goes glitchy and green and fuzzy. Then it pauses and it takes forever to load.
I tested this out with my HBO and Netflix app. I wanted to make sure it wasn’t my tv, or internet connection. My tv is less than a year old and my internet connection is fine; and my other streaming apps don’t give me the hassle like this does. The other apps casted clear and perfectly for me.
Very frustrating. I’m starting to wonder if it’s even worth it anymore. Please fix issue and I’d be happy to change my review, thanks."

Now all of a sudden it cannot connect to my account. I try my boyfriend’s account. Still the same thing. Its been happening for literally no reason each time i try to log in now it says error 83. Yall need to fix this because at this rate, i wont be paying another month for disney+ if its going to log me out of my account and not be efficient. Literally so annoying. Try to contact disney+ support and the wait time is longer than an hour. Doesnt say how long but they expect you to wait over an hour for something that was literally just working. So annoying!!!!! Fix it!!!!"
2019-11-19 14:43:44,Great movie/show selection! Needs improvement tho.,3,goldwolf20,False,"As a hardcore Disney fan, Disney + has to be one of the greatest things to happen to me! $7 a month??? It’s a steal. However... the app really really really needs to improve on a couple things. 

The biggest one is a “Continue Watching” list. For this reason alone, I think Netflix is better. It’s such a small thing but makes a big difference, like why do I have to search for my favorite show every single time I open the app and then scroll to the season I was in the middle of? 

Secondly, I wish that the online browser of Disney + would stay full screen when transitioning to the next episode of a show. Again, another thing I admire from Netflix. It’s like it’s just tedious to keep double clicking every 20 minutes... Not the most important thing, but makes a difference."
2019-11-14 00:42:09,Changes to watchlist,5,YOYOHOMEYYO,False,"I believe a few updates to the watchlist will greatly improve overall functionality.
Please organize watchlist A-Z and/or separate category to Movies, Shorts, and Shows. Please please have an auto play to your next video conveniently without having to go back to your library. Please please have a continue watching section to conveniently pick up where you left off. 
Most platforms are doing this already.
The watchlist as it stands is just a dumping ground, a bottomless pit, that needs options to organize as it can swell into the hundreds. A-Z is preferred at minimum. Again, this will greatly improve overall convenience.
So far it’s been great and has exceeded my expectations. Thanks 🙌🤞🤜🤘🏻👌🏻"
2020-09-05 01:20:22,B loves Disney+ but......,5,shortlyb,False,"Disney + let’s me relive my childhood and teenage years I love it but I do wish it had my airbud movies to. I would like to give the company a little advice although the app does let me watch shows and movies that I still to this day love it wouldn’t hurt to see more content that the age group of 22 and over would find more appropriate for their age like let’s say for instance, the Lizzie McGuire reboot I was so looking forward to seeing on Disney+. I was looking forward to seeing Lizzie as an adult and what was she up to nowadays. I know the company has a reputation but if the company truly wants to survive the streaming industry you have to understand and loosen up a little bit so here’s what I say let the Lizzie McGuire reboot happen."
2020-06-10 15:53:39,Great app,5,ima boss girl 111,False,This app is amazing I can watch a ton of shows and movies with my family without having to pay money just to rent the movie but the one thing that kind of bugs me is that some movies are not available until a certain date like my daughter wanted to watch the live action beauty and the beast but we will not be able to watch it until October 1 and that can be frustrating at times. And also the download when I download a movie to watch in the plane or in the car it takes a very long time to load and if I try and download more then 2 movies at once one of the movies would not download. But overall this is a great app and I would recommend it to others
2019-12-24 14:07:45,It’s great but...,3,SkittenKittens,False,"I love Disney Plus, and was so excited to hear that it came out. Although there is one pretty big problem, and it mostly only happens when I use my T.V. It always freezes up and skips; when it freezes. (and it happens constantly through out the movies and or t.v. show) Then, My whole Disney Plus will be Frozen. Now I’m not the most patient person, but I have waited way too long sometimes for a movie. I love Disney and would usually will never have a problem with it, but at the end of the day it just doesn’t work and it’s a pain in the buttocks. Other than that I love Disney and don’t have any other problem with the app, for it has tons of great movies and T.V. shows from my childhood that the Disney Channel no longer has, and along with that I can not wait for Frozen 2 to come out onto this platform."
2019-12-02 21:16:39,Playback bugs and server incapacity,2,JustoD,False,"There is LOTS of room for improvement. I downloaded some episodes to avoid server issues. Still encountered playback problems, meaning there are several bugs there. There can be shortcuts added such as navigating to episode list from the downloaded section, instead of researching for the show in a separate menu. Everything is separated when it can and should be interconnected to work intuitively as one has come to expect.
Even with all the issues, the app does perform better than the website, which rarely works when I access. I would prefer a larger computer screen over my mobile device, so that needs a major rehaul. 
I am surprised there hasn't been an incremental patch at this point, as updates are expected at least weekly, especially with a major roll out.
2 stars instead of 1 because of content."
2019-11-17 04:46:12,Absolutely love it but...,4,Angie23027,False,I absolutely love this app in just a few days thats been out I've watch over 10 movies and introduced some of my favorite princess movies to my daughter. But i hope that in future updates you guys include the “continue watching” section since i do stop it on and off during the day with both my daughters so i have to go to the search engine to find what the girls or me where watching  to be able to continue. Also it would be helpful if while watching a series the episodes you’ve watched would get marked I’m having to write down what episode/season i stop at so i can search for it to be able to continue. When you guys are able to fix those things im sure to give this a five star rating since i love love love this app.
2019-11-17 20:41:14,Have you never used a streaming app before?,1,Zoo babies,False,"I’m only giving 1 star because it’s not that difficult to mimic what other people are doing. You aren’t creating anything new an innovating, you’re copying a competitor with your own content. It’s a given that Disney content would be available on a Disney streaming app, so you get no points there. 

The basics of streaming are totally missing. There is no “continue watching”. You can’t pick up where you left off, in a movie or series. No auto play. No seasonal break downs.  It doesn’t show you what you’ve watched and what you haven’t. There isn’t an option to start from the beginning, or resume...just play.  These are very basic things and they’re missing. Also it doesn’t give you the option to choose which profile you’re viewing on, and defaults to the main profile. You have to figure out how to create a profile and then find it. 👎🏼 

You’re Disney....you can do better."
2019-11-15 16:21:37,Good but Still Waiting For A Lot,3,msotavy,False,"Obviously everyone loves Disney... there’s a lot of good content on here but it’s still missing a good amount of old classic shows. They’re pushing Avengers and Star Wars so hard but what about all the shows we used to watch when we came home from school?

Anyways, the app itself needs adjustments. 
• For some reason, captions keep coming on per episode even when I turn off the captions at the beginning of the show. There’s no option for preference in the settings for on or off throughout the whole app. 
• Like other people are saying, there’s nothing that continues what episode we left off on when we restart the app. It goes back to episode 1 of season 1. I feel like this is a general expectation for a streaming app to have. 
• On that note, there should be like a “continue” tab or something on the top of the welcome screen so we can easily access the last episode of whatever show or movie we left off on. 
• There’s definitely a better way to allow access the “watchlist” ... perhaps next to the downloads on the bottom bar would be a good place to put it. 

There’s been a lot of hype for this app and their service. You would think they’d test out all options for the best user experience."
2019-11-12 15:39:23,Can’t connect,1,sonnymom3,False,"I did a pre-sign up for the service on 11-10. I got the prompts to put in my email, create a password and enter my preferred credit card info for future billing. It went all the way through and showed a countdown clock for when the service would be available. 20 minutes ago I went to log in and it said it didn’t recognize my email address. I created the account all over again. 🤨 I entered the same card I entered 2 days before. It said there was an error with my name. Seriously? It was exactly what us on my card. Tried it twice and it wouldn’t accept it. I tried a different card with no issue. Then I downloaded the app for my iPhone. I logged in and now it tells me there is a connection issue and I’ll have to try at a later time. They knew there were going to be millions of new users. I would think they would have been more than ready for this. Now I’m not so sure this is worth the effort. 😡"
2019-11-12 14:56:25,Seriously??!!,2,PhoenixKP5,False,"I pre-subscribed and everything so I would be ready for the launch day. 
I download the app - all good. I go on the app and first thing it says is “unable to connect - retry”. So I hit retry. I don’t know how many times I pushed that button, but nothing changed. I check my wifi - it’s good. So I’m like okay maybe I just have a weak signal. Then I go to my profile to edit it a little (change my name, profile pic, etc.”)......and it comes up with the same message “unable to connect - retry”! Really??!! I can’t even do that?!
Then by some lucky miracle I actually did get on the main menu (for like 5 min), and every time I went to add something to my watchlist, it wouldn’t add it OR it would say “unable to add”. Seriously??!!
I expected it wouldn’t be perfect in the beginning with everyone trying to use it and all that, but I didn’t think it would be this bad!! It’s ridiculous!! Fix it Disney!"
2019-11-30 05:51:36,Not worth it so far,2,Wastintime,False,"Buggy and crashes constantly... constantly says it can’t connect to the internet, meanwhile Netflix and prime are plugging along fine.  I get apps and new services will have teething issues, but a lot of it is ridiculous.  They had two services to literally study before releasing this.  Sound quality is AWFUL and random.  You’ll watch one episode of something and if you don’t turn the sound all the way up you can’t hear anything.  The next it’ll blow your speakers out.  Video quality seems awful on most things where I’d expect it to be amazing.  I even switched TVs thinking it was just the tv I was watching on, but no... On top of which, honestly there isn’t much content.  Granted it’s a pretty cheap service... so far.  I wonder when the first price hike will be.  It’s a streaming service that really streams pretty poorly, so to me it’s pretty much just a flop."
2019-11-18 13:15:54,Disney+ is excellent- a few key features need work,4,MAJJacobs,False,"I LOVE Disney+. I finally feel like there’s a (relatively) complete streaming catalogue of Disney classics. I’m enjoying the Mandalorian and the Imagineering Story is incredible. I would like to have more original content sooner, but there is plenty to keep me occupied. With a low price and generous access (profiles, downloads, multiple streams, etc.), I think subscribing is a no-brainer. 

There are a few issues with the app that need to be dealt with. The watchlist is hidden in both the iPad and iPhone apps. There seems to be a glitch, where you can’t remove something from the watchlist. Also, it’s not clear when or if you will be resuming or restarting a title. Please fix these technical oversights so I can more fully enjoy my service!"
2019-12-31 02:09:01,Amazing and Worth It,5,Amazing App And Worth It,False,"I have been using Disney+ for two months now. Since I’ve started, I have watched many movies and tv shows like That’s So Raven or Jessie or Inside Out and more! These are movies I’ve wished to watch for so long and I finally can ! I am only nine(9) and it has been a dream come true to watch so many movies at home in one day! Thank you so much for this amazing app! The only improvement is that the pause button turns into a loading button all the time for me. It’s a little annoying but I’m ok. I always have to leave the full screen to the side screen to pause the movie/show . Please improve this so people will enjoy this app even more. 

                                            Thank You"
2019-12-16 22:54:26,APP SECURITY EXTREMELY BAD!,1,disney+👎,False,My account has been breached multiple times within the past few days no matter how many times I’ve changed both the email and password on the account! If you can answer their customer service reps basic questions they will let anyone access your account! They have no extra security features at all! The only method and solution they offer to secure your account is to change your account email and password that’s it! And when you contact them their response to an account breach is to change the accounts email and password and that they will forward the situation to their tech/it department and they thank you for any suggestions you make to them that’s it! Disgraceful they should be ashamed of themselves for rushing to release their app to the public! The only way to stop this and protect your account is to delete your account and open a new account! Ridiculous!
2019-12-02 03:45:35,People are so critical !!! Disney is amazing!!,5,Paddlehiker,False,"To everyone with some common sense, listen...!!! Disney just released a HUGE library of content and it seems to have like 95% of their stuff at your fingertips immediately! Now think for a second....what do you think will happen when 10 million or more people sign up for this AMAZING content and try to binge everything imaginable in just 3 short weeks?!!! Of course there will be some bugs and some crashes and some buffering!!! They will work it out!! Just be thankful we have all of this great content available at an amazing price !! I’m a happy customer for sure and love every part of it !!!  Now sign up already and watch some Star Wars and Avengers now !"
2019-11-21 16:51:22,Needs minor fixes but I’m happy with the app!,4,Macy Joy,False,"I’m glad this app is out and has so much great, new AND old content! My main issue with it is, and I kind of would’ve thought this would’ve been a thing before launching the app. It’s probably being worked on currently but there needs to be a “continue watching” shelf on the main screen. And when I leave an episode and come back later it don’t remember which episode I’m on and there’s no markers or indication on the episode to show that was the one I had been watching. So it’s kind of a guessing game. I’m glad it still saves where I last was when I do click on the right episode. If it didn’t do that, I’d be more annoyed. I’m sure those are things that will be fixed soon though! Overall GREAT APP!"
2019-11-18 12:43:01,Great Content but A couple MAJOR flaws,3,JanniseAmaya,False,"I was very excited when Disney announced this service and the content provided has lived up to the hype. However the app and interface needs work. With the multitude of streaming apps before Disney plus, there is no reason why Disney Plus released this app without a currently watching list or category. There is no easy way to go back to what you’ve been watching. You have to go back and search it all over again. And then to add insult to injury. You can’t even hit play on the show you’ve been watching and it play from your last watched episode. You have to go to whatever episode and it will still play from the very beginning. It’s very annoying and kind of shocking because it looks like Disney didn’t do their homework. Fix it, sooner rather than later."
2019-11-15 23:53:42,Has major flaws,3,DarthV_,False,"It’s great to have all my favorites ready to watch but it has some major flaws. 
1. There is no “Continue Watching” or anything of the sort so you have to search what you were watching and press play. It also doesn’t say “resume”.
2. The episodes on shows don’t restart from the beginning. Very frustrating to drag the dot on an iPad. It takes me like 5 tries to restart an episode because it skips to the next immediately.
3. There is no way to tell which episode you are on when watching a show. It’s a problem if you fall asleep and don’t know where you left off.
4. Not all available titles are listed. Some movies I wanted to watch had to be searched so you can be missing out on some of your favorites. On Netflix you can scroll through every title available to view."
2020-10-13 12:45:29,Customer Service is Horrendous,1,bshaisjb286$&,False,"The services and content itself is great, sure. But, I needed to do something as simple as change an account email across my Disney bundle, something that should’ve been handled in a 5 minute call, and couldn’t be. I called 3 separate times and was on hold for longer that 30 minutes before I hung up, tried online chat twice with no avail. Finally canceled my bundle out of frustration, and now Disney+ is saying it’s going to cut off my viewing at the end of October when I paid for a whole year a few months ago. 

It’s just highly disappointing coming from Disney. And even if they reached out to help remedy my problem as seen on my cancelation page, they will be reaching out to a void email (the problem I was trying to fix in the first place.) get your stuff together Disney, it’s not all about churning people through for profit, there has to be a balance and service attached."
2020-04-16 13:11:30,Great app but with a big bug,2,Billy bobby D,False,"Won’t let me watch any show or movie. I tried updating it but it doesn’t work. I don’t see the point of an app that lets you watch movies and shows but doesn’t let you watch anything. Whenever i want to watch something it says “Oops something went wrong with watching”. Ive have open and closed this app many times and it still doesn’t work. This app was working just fine until today and it really frustrates me. If this keeps happening i plan on deleting the app. If you can tell me what’s wrong and how to fix it, it will do me a great favor. Other than that I don’t see myself watching Disney+ until its fixed. It was a great app in general and I love how you keep adding more movies. Ive got to experience movies i missed in theaters because of this app. Again i really do love this app and i hope you can fix it so i can use it more."
2020-01-27 01:25:38,Pretty good,5,Sharky2082,False,"I’ve been using Disney+ on my iPad since December and, overall this app is absolutely great. It has all the movies/shows for me to watch everyday. There is no bugs to me for to complain about its a BIG step up from Disney now. Plus Disney+ has all the classics like Aladdin, Cinderella, and much much more. So that’s why I give this app a 5 star rating. Disney+ has ALL of it. It’s got Star Wars, avengers, and marvel. And ya, but that’s only small parts about why I like Disney plus. Disney+ has an adult profile, and a kids profile. The only difference between them is that the kids profile has PG movies/TV-PG and G movies/TV-G and adult profiles have all the way up to PG-13.(or if Disney owns R movies (which I doubt) that’s basically it for this review."
2019-12-01 17:05:51,I need an answer,1,xXSNPERSHOTXx,False,I used the free trial already and so my brother had gotten the subscription for a month so he put me on his account and while I was eating breakfast I had to update my card info I didn’t really think much about it until I went into my bank account and saw that Disney plus charged me for using buy brothers account that had a whole 3 weeks left of a subscription so at this point I am already ticked off because they charged me while using my brothers account which had a paid subscription and now I want my money back because I have used this app in like a week so I’m hoping that we can work something out and hopefully get my money back and you guys can take the subscription off of my account so I can go back to my brothers also I didn’t use the app for a while so when I went back to see my account I noticed that I wasn’t in my brothers account which made me very furious. Thank you for your time.
2020-01-04 10:02:48,"Great app, needs some changes",4,wontpayforpremium,False,"I recently got the app on my phone and the selection of movies and shows is definitely enough for one person, especially if you are a fan of Disney movies, however the app has some bugs and glitches which need to be fixed. Occasionally while watching, the show or movie will stop playing and send you back into the home page, and at one point, it deleted my continue watching folder, which was rather frustrating. So far it has only happened once, and I have faith it won’t happen again. These are minor and easy bugs to fix, and are tiny inconveniences. I would without a doubt recommend the app and Disney plus to anyone who felt interested in the content on the platform."
2019-11-19 05:54:27,Gripe,2,Hargggg,False,"It’s so cool but it’s missing some stuff. I love all the content and don’t mind waiting for some things like infinity war. But as far as I can tell there’s no play back feature. So I normally have to find where I was in the movie if my app closes. Also sometimes the video closes and goes to the main menu at random then I have to find my place again. Also the audio on the movies like captain marvel goes in and out and sounds like it is under water sometimes. I thought it was my headphones but it did this on all my devices at the exact same time. Tv, computer, and phone. Finally it would be nice to have a continue watching section like what Netflix has. So you can see where you are on everything you’re watching. Honestly though I feel like these will all be fixed soon, it’s just frustrating to pay $70 for something that doesn’t work right."
2019-11-13 00:16:40,It has everything.,5,Skittlebrau46,False,"Seriously. There isn’t a show or movie we have thought to look for that isn’t here. And that’s not even talking about the 70+ things that we had forgotten all about until we saw it again in the menu! Shows from our childhood are all here, ready for us to share them with our kids!

Anyone complaining about the slowdowns or crash issues, remember that it’s a brand new service, and millions of people are hitting it all at once. Disney will take care of it. They don’t know how to have a bad customer experience. I am sure they are even more upset that there are crashes than the people experiencing the crashes are. Disney doesn’t do bad customer service!"
2020-04-25 04:38:56,It’s very frustrating,2,toolshedd30,False,Overall the app is decent but not when it won’t load. I have been using the app for a while now probably 5 months and i use chrome cast to cast to other TVs and it buffers all the time and it’s not my internet connection. Even downloading the movie/ series it still buffers every 3s and no longer allows you to watch anything and when you leave the app or turn off your device u were using it causes a major restart of the app and no longer gives the controls for the TV like volume and options to disconnect or pause. it gets very frustrating to the point of me having to just unplug things to actually get it to disconnect because the controls no longer allow proper disconnect options due to the app restarting and requiring you to refresh from the home screen of your device multiple times.
2019-11-25 16:49:09,Love it....but it has some problems,4,amy1811,False,"I love this app and it is great on my tv!!!! I love that I have access to all the movies I grew up with and love and can not share with my children! I don’t love how it performs on an iPad. My child has a lot of problems navigating it. It tends to push her out and completely reload, not saving the spot where she was on the movie. I would love a section of movies currently watching or a watchlist slide under each persons page. I love the child guide however, Moana isn’t on it??? That makes no sense to me?!?!? The app ( on iPad) moves all over the screen and I don’t know- just seems flaky! I feel like it could be A LOT  better and more like what is available on other streaming apps. I have most of them and Disney has a lot of learning in that area."
2019-12-30 19:50:44,Buy this,5,i need to go bathroom!,False,"First off if you don’t have this app than I don’t know how your living. This app has all the Disney shows, movies, and shorts! I love it. And on the plus side you can download stuff! Like imagine your on a plane 18 hour flight, have nothing to watch, no internet! Oh wait I downloaded my favorite Disney movie of all time on Disney plus! Problem solved. My whole entire family loves this app (Including my teenage siblings and parents). This is like Netflix but ALL Disney. So if you travel a lot (like on ✈️planes) and you love Disney, then this is the app for you. I especially love the downloading part because I travel a long distance every year so it’s great for me, and maybe for you! So my result:BUY THIS APP NO QUESTIONS ASKED!😁"
2019-12-27 06:18:52,great !,5,SJJLBL,False,"disney is my life and childhood ! watching all these princess movies and tv shows brings me back to when i was a little kid in front of the television.  this nostalgic feeling is all ive been getting, with the decade ending and all.  watching these tv shows from the early 2000s and 2010s, helps me not to forget the memories ive made in the past.  for example, jessie, girl meets world, boy meets world, good luck charlie, pocahontas, and more ! i recently purchased a projector to watch christmas movies on with my family, and watching disney princess movies was a great way to create new bonds.  we were able to just sit there eating snacks for hours, laughing and crying.  my mom and i recently rewatched moana from disney+, and all the memories began flooding in while i devoured oranges and popcorn.  i remembered how my mom cared about me so much that she would take me to the movies whenever a new cartoon film came out, and how we would sit together eating popcorn and nachos at the theatre.  disney+ helped me to not take those moments for granted.  disney+ does have tiny bugs to fix here and there, but overall, i highly recommend for its price.  thank you :))"
2019-11-21 03:15:49,Good but not great,4,Jsshxjdhdudhdhd,False,"The content itself is awesome and only going to get better as the other things Disney owns but are on other platforms(like some of the newer Star Wars movies on Netflix) will soon have the contract over and Disney can bring them back to their streaming service. My main problem is the app. There are some minor bugs and the main problem is your watchlist. Like most streaming services, there is a list for you to add everything you want to watch too easily access it, but this one has an issue. No matter what platform you are on(IOS, Windows, and Xbox are what I’ve used), you cannot remove something from your watchlist. This makes your list cluttered with things you’ve finished, and is a nightmare for people with OCD like me."
2019-11-20 09:21:19,Great app!,4,birthdefective,False,"It’s has everything you can want from Disney. If it doesn’t have it currently it’s nice that when you search the movie or tv show it tells you the date that it will be on the app. 

Only issue I hope they fix in a future update is the rewind function. 
There’s no option for a “start for the beginning” so you have to hold the button down to rewind it. It sounded ridiculous to complain about it. But let’s be honest we’re us to this function by now. 
But it’s mostly bothersome with the TV shows. It has auto play so when the ep is over and credit role. It changes it mid way through to the next episode. Which is amazing! Just when you go back to play the same ep it picks up in the credits. Sometimes it goes to fast that you can’t catch it soon enough to rewind it the ep (if you’re on an ipad) and then if you watch the ep that plays after before it’s just more credits, Kinda a loop of credits. 

It’s amazing app over all despite this minor issue I hope they will fix in an update! The app is still new so don’t blame them for still needing some work. It is however still worth the money. It’s my new favorite go to app for streaming tv."
2019-11-13 01:05:24,Disney!!!!,4,2BeAFitMom,False,"I'm super excited for the Disney plus and of course everyone is sleeping in. So I thought I would make the profiles but the app is having issues with that. I tried making one profile and I don't think it registered I made it and I can't make anymore it says it can't connect or something. So I can't wait to watch all the movies but I'd like to make profiles especially for my kids.

Edit: I want to add, some movies didn't play at first but I found one that would so after watching a movie I'm feeling like more and more movies will play ok and and now more parts of the app are working but there are still some issues with it. So if anyone's having issues, just keep trying. I think there's just a lot of people excited for it on launch day lol."
2019-11-19 04:43:16,Disney+ is a plus!,5,Andrew_Perez93,False,"I am pleasantly surprised with the release of Disney streaming service. It’s a great app. Runs smooth, the content being streamed is very high quality. That’s usually a pet peeve of mine, a choppy app. C’mon it’s Disney, they can hire the best app developers in the world. I usually have trouble streaming other apps using my data on my phone. But Disney+ works great. The best part is if you have a 4K tv, you don’t need to pay a extra price to stream ultra HD content. It’s all inclusive. The ONLY problem I have. And I cannot believe they didn’t think about it, is I am unable to continue watching my shows and movies. Once I exit, and play it again. It starts all over. Then I have to fast forward where I left off."
2019-11-18 13:50:20,Confused,5,Lgonzal1,False,"I’m confused as to why it’s allowing people to make multiple accounts with the same email address. Makes no sense to be able to make an account for the basic plan and then make another one for the bundle with the same email. I figured it would automatically change my choice when I clicked to sign up for the bundle not make a whole other account with the same email. Now the app won’t update from the basic subscription to the bundle subscription but when I go to the website to sign in, it has me for the bundle subscription but is saying I have two accounts. The wait time to solve this issue over the phone is ridiculous!! No help what so ever."
2019-11-17 17:26:10,Wishing for more options,3,C. Rarity,False,"I’m giving a pretty modest review for multiple reasons but I have 2 main issues. The fist being that there are so many things saying “coming on this date” and there is a lacking of shows and movies that Disney owns because it is considered “to adult” but they can have The Simpsons? I believe there should be an option to have the full spectrum of Disney owned movies. The second thing I dislike is when fast forwarding or rewinding it glitches a lot.

-Revise additional issue-

Some of the shows such as “Andi Mack” are missing episodes so you can’t watch it unless you’ve seen the first few episodes already. Just very confusing why it is that way. Other things such as movies say “coming soon” and will say when it’ll be added but it’s just an inconvenience to have to wait so long."
2020-04-22 11:21:57,"Disney content 5*s, the app not so much",4,Orokusaki,False,"Don’t sleep on the app for sure, because all the Disney stuff you’ve ever wanted to watch is on this thing. The content is well worth the inexpensive subscription cost.

The app itself still needs some work, although as of version 1.4.4, it has fixed lots of issues, like keeping track of where exactly a video was left when paused and device closed and reopen the app.

It needs a watch history for the account and better parental controls for curating and filtering things. Very Netflix-like, and I have the same gripes with Netflix’s “helpful” content organization. Still, the major hitters like Marvel and Star Wars and Pixar are easy to get to, since they’re permanently on the top of the start-up UI."
2020-07-28 01:37:42,Couple new suggestions to mickey mouse shorts,3,nathancook2003,False,"First of all. I like watching every movie made by disney for all an incredible low payment in total hd quality and almost no buffering. Secondly, I love the mickey mouse shorts. No episodes are bad and everything is good, but I found a flaw. While every short is on that series, I still couldn't find the christmas special, and the halloween special of mickey mouse shorts, even the outside of M.M. shorts and I still can't find it. Maybe later, could you add these missing episodes to mickey mouse shorts? I loved the halloween episode. Anyway, like your app

Update: Problem with screen while watching a movie. The screen zooms for no reason, blocking sides on the screen, and I don't want that. Please fix this. I already responded to you about this, so this is a second time. Thank you"
2019-12-17 21:51:47,A couple of glitches.,5,Ronthegardener,False,"First let me say . . . I love the content!

I’ve had a couple of problems since it began.

1. I first noticed with the Mandalorian – the shows would start, kick out and restart two and sometimes three times before playing through. 

2. I watch Lab Rats and am into the second season. When I finish watching an episode, I’ll let the next episode just begin and back out from there to the main Disney+ menu then ultimately to my Apple TV menu. When I return to begin watching a Lab Rats episode where I left off I am almost always taken back to the beginning of Season 1 – Episode 19. Weird. 

3. I’ve also noticed that when watching Lab Rats and hitting the menu button on my Apple TV I’m taken out to the Disney+ menu and not to the Lab Rats episode menu. I’m not certain if that’s right or not, but it seems as though I should be taken to the episode menu. This is a particular nuisance when I want to resume watching the episode of Lab Rats I where I left of and have to fast forward through Season 1 –Episode 19 to get to the episode menu. 

Many thanks for your time and consideration."
2019-12-12 01:56:18,"Great, but not the best.",2,iOSxReview,False,"The movie/tv content is fantastic. However someone hacked my account and there’s stuff i never watched and no one else but my wife uses it and she uses her profile and she said there’s shows she never watched showing up. 
There’s no way to force logout, also there’s some tv shows I tried to watch but did not like and it stays on continue watching and I can’t remove it. There should be a option to remove things from watch history or remove shows you don’t want to keep watching or a option to remove from continue watching. 
Sometimes when you click add to watchlist it will show a check mark and then when you want to remove it from watch list the check mark is gone and reclicking and unclicking it does not remove films from watch list. 

Other than that once all this is worked out it’ll be a great contender."
2019-11-26 07:06:17,"Great idea, mediocre execution",2,t_pask,False,"It has a lot of content, but it’s really not ready for release yet due to all its problems. 

1- Missing Features: their UI is clunky and requires too many clicks to get to things. Also if I want to see details on a movie or add it to my Watchlist I have to click on it, opening a new page. Going back reloads the previous page, losing my place. This makes it difficult to browse through content. Not a big deal, just an annoying QoL thing. 

2- Buffering Issues: I recently watched Guardians of the Galaxy, which has a runtime of 2 hours. However, it took 2 hours and 30 minutes to watch because it kept pausing to buffer so often. That’s just sloppy. And every movie I’ve watched so far has had this problem where it needs to buffer forever. I’ve never had this problem with any other streaming service like Netflix or Prime Video. 

3- Sound Too Quiet: in quiet scenes, I can’t hear anything, even with my volume turned up all the way. I’ll turn my headphones to full blast and still can’t hear what’s going on. This is not a problem for me with other streaming services. 

Basically, this app has a lot of promise, and all the Disney content is amazing! But they need to fix a lot of things in order to make their service worth it."
2019-11-20 02:59:19,Absolutely love! But needs a bit,5,AllieJai07,False,"This app is amazing. Disney + is something I have been watching non-stop. Everything is neatly organized, it plays well, and the movies and shows are great!

However, there are a few things that need to be edited. First, the very common issue, the currently watching section. This is needed, because sometimes it is a bit of extra work to search for the movie or show you are watching.

Second, Disney + needs to add the recent live action movies. Such as The Jungle Book, Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, and The Lion King. Toy Story 4 and Descendants 3 are also missing. I don’t understand why they are not there, because the live action Lady and the Tramp is, but whatever. These are some of my favorite movies and it would be so much better if they were on the app.

Third, there needs to be some way to tell how far along you are into a show or movie. It is a bit frustrating not knowing how far you are into the movie. There needs to be some way to tell.

Fourth, there is no fourth! This is a very great app, so much work was put in to it. I plan to keep using Disney + in the future!"
2019-11-12 07:51:05,Look out Netflix! Disney has done it again!,5,Alpha0727,False,"I just got done watching Episode 1 of The Mandalorian and I just had to write a review for Disney+. I was a little worried that there would be huge issues with downloading Disney+, logging in, and streaming video on release. The types of issues that usually happen when a service has a huge demand. I was surprised that there were no such issues. I breezed through every step as if I was using a time tested service. Even while watching The Mandalorian, I didn’t have any buffering or video quality issues. It streamed flawlessly! I can not wait for Episode 2! I am looking forward to seeing what Disney has waiting up their sleeves in the future!"
2020-07-14 18:56:37,Still lagging,2,🤷🏽‍♂️🏂🤧,False,I don’t know how many updates it’s going to take for this lagging to be fixed but I’m literally just wasting my money monthly on this app and I don’t even watch it because it continues to lag. Updates have been made but none of them has fixed problem like what are those updates even for ? The app works on a cellular device but on a Tv it’ll play what I want to watch and then freezes a scene randomly but the audio still plays. I’ve looked up videos on how to fix the issue and people have been having the same problem I have and the videos I watched were 5-7 months ago and still the problem consists so I restate my question what are those updates even for ? My WiFi is definitely not the problem either unless you must have to have some type of Verizon 5Ghz WiFi just to stream princess and the frog.
2020-01-24 19:54:24,"Still love it, but needs some help!",4,Lyssycarp,False,"I have been watching Star Wars on it and would have to step away for some time to where it turns off, so when I come back I can see under ‘Continue Watching’ the movie I had been watching so I click on it thinking it will take me to the part I left off, but it doesn’t, it starts allll over! And it’s kind of a bit annoying. Considering when I do fast forward through it all to find the space I left off I can’t tell where I’m fast forwarding to, due to there being no pictures displaying the parts I’m fast forwarding through. So, please please please fix this for me and many others! It seems to be working with the TV shows but hasn’t been established with the movies. Thanks so much!"
2020-02-08 03:04:25,The best app,5,balletny,False,Omg Disney+ is the best It has everything Disney I love it so much ever since the day I got it it has all of my favorite TV shows and movies and I can’t even find them on Disney+ now so Disney+ is seriously the best and after you have you have to buy this it’s so good it has all the Disney movies it has all the Disney TV show it’s so so amazing especially love the Jeff Goldblum show it’s so fun I only wish that they would be a new episode of Pixar in real life every week just like all the other shows but this app is still the best only thing I play oh me I only have five apps on my iPad it because Disney+ it’s just like everything I need so you have to you have to get this app because it is the best.
2019-11-15 23:59:06,"Great service, but app could use some improvements",4,Redhorsechick89,False,"I love this service/app overall . The selection of movies and shows is incredible, I was wondering if they plan on adding “ The Three Lives Of Thomasina” in the future? Also they need to add the option to resume or watch from the beginning . I don’t like having to rewind to go back to the beginning. I know if you watch through the entire thing including credits that it will restart but even Netflix has that option to restart the show or movie.  Also a section to show what you have already started watching would be nice. It’s also hard to tell what you have already added to your watch list without going to your watch list. Other than that I love this app."
2019-12-05 02:55:20,Please do us all a favor and add these shows NOW!!!,5,Giselle E. Rodriguez,False,"Hear me out, Disney+ is the best! It’s great and has such great quality and volume. The one thing that disturbed me quite a bit was the fact that you guys do not have the ICONIC show(s) Austin and Ally, Dog With a Blog, and A.N.T. Farm. To be honest with you, the main reason why I got Disney+ was for those three shows and many more of course but my main priority was to rewatch Austin and Ally and it really disappointed me how you did not add that show in when I’m pretty sure everyone else who got Disney+ was expected to have that show on here. So if you could do us all a favor and please add Austin and Ally, Dog With a Blog, and A.N.T. Farm on Disney+ please, just to satisfy us. It’s the LEAST you can do!"
2019-12-24 21:50:27,Needs some improvement,4,love_prettymuch,False,"First off, this app is amazing and the tv shows and movies on here are incredible. However, I don’t know if there is just something wrong with my device but whenever I download a movie or episode and am in a location where there Is no service and I try to watch what I downloaded it pauses as if what I am watching wasn’t downloaded. Also, there should be an option where you manage the devices on the account because people have access to my password who I regret giving too which is a mistake on my behalf but there should be an option where you could control the devices signed in to the account. Thank you so much! And I hope you take this into consideration with the new update."
2020-09-10 17:58:30,MAGICAL! but one glitch,5,spencerplays234,False,"Overall, this App is By far the BEST Disney Movie/show HUB I have ever seen, This is MUCH better than DisneyNOW.  There is one Slight Mishap however, This Glitch only Appears on an Apple IPad (as far as I know) This glitch happens when you Use the “Picture in Picture” Feature when you Feel like texting your Friend while your Show is Still Going. Well when I use the feature, It works, but, When You go back in the App, it only Takes it to realize after 5 seconds to realize “hey! I should go back to the Home Menu!” It Just Crashes into the Home Menu. Yeah, this Glitch is Really A Pain but, Again, it’s a Really Good App I definitely Recommend Downloading this!"
2020-05-10 15:32:46,Kids Profile,3,SamH1211,False,"I pay for this subscription specifically for my daughter. I love the format of the kid profile but there are a NUMBER of movies that she loves that do not show up on her profile. Most specifically, Moana. Why in the world would that movie not be included on the kid’s profile? I have also found it difficult to search for certain things. For example, there are six tinker bell movies on the service, but no easy way to search for all of them. Searching tinker bell doesn’t bring them all up. There should be a collection like there is for frozen. This makes searching soooo much easier. Adding more of those collections would really improve the experience. Overall this service is great, but was of use for children should be a driver for the experience on a Disney service."
2020-01-03 15:15:32,"Selection is great, app compatibility is not",1,CalebLS,False,"Love the selection of movies and shows but the app compatibility is horrible. Disney has chosen to not support older iOS versions before version 11 which is a very bad decision for family friendly apps due to older devices being reused as child devices once they are swapped out for newer devices. Due to the the timing of Apple stopping support for iOS updates this will cause devices to not be compatible with the service, resulting in a real cost that is much much higher than the competition streaming services. Personally, we have two iPads that cannot be updated past iOS 10, all other competitor video streaming apps work with the exception of Disney+ that was supposed to be “family friendly” but this policy seems to be exactly the opposite causing the need for additional expense and increased waste since a new device would be needed and the old would be thrown out."
2019-12-02 12:13:38,Needs more shows / movies,4,SlinkySatear,False,Okay so I’ve been on Disney plus from time to time but can’t use it much because of my schedule. Whenever I go on it I don’t find some shows / movies I look for. Like Toy Story 4 and I was going to watch Gravity Falls but there is only one season. There is a limited amount of movies and it is missing the new ones such as The Lion King real life. I think that the Disney movies that are in theatre should be on Disney plus a month after they come out in theatres. Like Frozen 2 I had to go to the movie theater to watch it. I don’t mod going to the movie theater but I wouldn’t want to go to the movie theatre every time I want to watch Frozen 2. I paid for a year of Disney plus and because I’m paying I goalie have more options in the app.
2019-11-13 19:04:01,So many movies!!!!,4,sunshine1978,False,"I love that Disney has set it up to have different categories. And I love that all my favorite movies are at super accessible now!!! There’s so many great movies on here and I’m excited to be able to watch them. 

For some critiques I just want to say a few things. I would love if it come up with a category to finishing watching a movie you started instead of having to go find the movie/show and start it from there. I also think that they should try to make it to where you can watch something on one devise and finish it on another so that way u don’t have to fast forward through the movie/show you already watched. 

Other than those some things I love the set up and can’t wait to have a binge night or week lol 😂"
2019-11-15 02:57:08,A couple of requests,3,friendtyou,False,"Already love the service, and I’m sure the bugs will work themselves out so I’m not too concerned. I do have a couple of requests for future versions of the app. I would like for there to a “continue watching” section so that it is easier to find and pick back up the shows I had to stop for whatever reason. The other request is to have a watch history log of some kind for at least profiles marked as kids profiles. I know it’s a family service, but there are still some things even on the kids profile that I would prefer my kids not watch yet until they get a little older and I haven’t seen a way to keep tabs on that. Thanks.

Edit: for some reason closed caption being on is a default setting and I would prefer the default to be off."
2019-11-14 15:38:23,Long Live Disney  💕 💜 ✨,5,Awesome person girl,False,"I got the app expecting a fairly large selection of movies. So I wasn’t surprised to see the large selection of movies when I first opened the app, however I recall the moment, (as insignificant as it may seem), when I saw the tv series “The Little Mermaid Series”. I just started crying because I absolutely loved that show when I was younger and it brought me back to a simpler time in my life. After further inspection of the app, I came across many other shows including Ducktakes (1987), Hercules the series, Soy Luna, phineas and Ferb, Gravity falls, The clone wars, and so much more! Thank you Disney! Sincerely for making such wholesome and wonderful content for all to enjoy 😊. May Disney live on for centuries to come!!"
2020-09-11 20:42:52,andi mack,4,Elizabeth 5486,False,"Disney+ is great app i’ve been watching movies all through quarantine. I also like that they have some disney channel shows. i don’t have cable at home so disney now doesn’t work for me. but i wish it had newer shows that they have on disney channel like the owl house i’ve been trying to find something to watch that on. The shows that are on disney+ some of them don’t have all their episodes. for example i was about to start andi mack yesterday but when i go and click it it only has episodes 11 and 12 instead of starting with 1,2,3,4,etc. it was the same with all the other seasons too. i’ve coming back to see if the app has updated but when i does it doesn’t fix the bug. thank you"
2020-05-10 00:24:52,Bug Fixes and Features Needed,4,ashelymccutchen,False,"Sometimes when we play a movie, the app will change the Audio from English to Dansk. It will also randomly turn the subtitles on. Super annoying. Also... if we don’t finish a movie one day and two days later decide to watch it from the beginning, we have to drag the placement button all the way to the beginning or end to restart it. There definitely needs to be a ‘play from beginning’ or ‘restart’ feature/button added. Also- volume needs to be adjusted for all movies and shows. Some are super loud and others are super low volume. Some also change throughout the viewing. Otherwise- we LOVE Disney+ and can’t wait for other movies/shows to be added."
2020-06-16 16:48:18,Poor customer service,1,Savannah Tay,False,Seen I was being charged twice for a months subscription so I asked to have it refunded. I was told by the customer rep that I should just cancel the subscription I just paid for to avoid the charge that was going to hit my account the next day. So I listened even after telling her that was not going to work and I was right. I was charged 15$ so I went back and asked for a refund just for the extra charge. 7.95 was supposed to be in my account 3-5 days after and I never received it. So I repeated and asked again for the 7.95 back but got the same response and no money. Now I’m upset and ask for the whole 15$ and it’s been two months since I was supposed to receive that refund. 3 talks with 3 differ customer reps and no money. I didn’t even watch anything on the account since I had to cancel the subscription! Customer service is a joke and I will NEVER use Disney+ again.
2019-11-13 22:07:42,Great Content - But Not Everything,4,jonericken,False,"It is a really great service and functionality. Lots of wonderful titles. However, I nearly laughed when I clicked on one of the titles to watch it (Mary Poppins Returns) and it says “Coming to Disney Plus January (Date) 2021”. Lots of things are on there like this so can be frustrating when you go to a title and it says when it is coming to the service months or years from now. Lastly, it’s annoying when you don’t know if you’ve watched an episode or title. It doesn’t mark it or tell you if you’ve watched it - hence when I was watching “Recess” I forgot where I left off. Overall - great first initial launch but again, hilarious the titles on here that you can’t even watch for months or years from now."
2020-03-27 23:02:33,"Great, I love it 😍, But one question...",3,KK 🐶,False,"Ok, to start I am ten years old and I love Disney plus. My mom got Disney plus almost about 4 weeks ago for us to watch things like the nature shows on it. But I found that it has a couple of other cool shows on it too. Though, I go to my friend’s house sometimes (who also has Disney plus) and she shows me cool movies/shows on it and when I go home to try and find them on my Disney plus, they don’t show up at all! ☹️ For example, a couple of days ago she told me that A WRINKLE IN TIME was on Disney plus and I know it is because I saw it on her’s. But I tried everything to find it and couldn’t. When I searched it on Disney plus it said “no results found.” I would really like if you could fix this. But overall I Love, Love, Love 💗 Disney plus. Thanks so much for reading."
2019-12-30 10:37:03,Amazing.... but login is faulty,5,Titttiiiieeesssss,False,"The app is amazing.... I’ve been binge watching old shows from the 90’s and movies from old times like Snow White or Pinocchio.... it’s amazing getting to see my childhood shows and movies and now I get to watch newer movies or live shows from old cartoons lol.... the 1 issue I’m dealing with is the login, every time I login the server tells me it’s having issue trying to connect to my account so Id have to delete and reinstall the app for it to work until I exit out and later on it notifies me it can’t connect to my account, so it’s like a repeat after repeat process... it only happens on my phone but not on my consoles, other than that this app is amazing😁😁😁"
2019-11-23 18:37:55,Disney+ Do better,1,JoshsterV,False,"Yall need to GET IT TOGETHER. 
After Adding the shows/movies I like to my watchlist, I only displays about 10 of them and then lists them over again. So my watchlist only has what it wants basically, Being that only a few things that I added to the watch list are listed.... and yall also need to add the Shows/movies that are missing. What the hell ?!?!?!? You dont make any sense, How do you guys have something called “Out The Vault” but leave the Vault filled with the shows/movies we Want to watch.... it doesn’t make sense. Shows like Jake the American Dragon/ or Legends of Tarzan / or my Favorite but I just cant seem to find it anywhere, Is a Lion King Tv Show but it is not named Timone and Pumba or that horrible show called the Lion Guard it was another Lion King Show that was just a regular show having all the characters in it. BRING THEM BACK PLEASE, ALONG WITH EVERYTHING ELSE YALL DID NOT BRING BACK EITHER. Like WHYYYY not make EVERYTHING available. I. Dont. Get It."
2019-11-19 02:08:37,Great content but not a great app,3,AKKJ2011,False,"Love the selection for the most part, though the catalogue of ""Wonderful World of Disney"" movies is notably missing, which I found pretty disappointing. The app often doesn't save your spot if you navigate away from your program for any reason; it will start over from the beginning so you have to find your place again. It also doesn't have a record of anything you recently watched or an ""up next"" if you're watching a series. The other annoying thing is it's not available on the older versions of Apple TV, so if you're like me and still using your original, you have to airplay all the content from another device. Overall I give the content selection 4 stars and the usability 2 stars. I suppose the price makes up for it somewhat."
2019-11-15 16:33:20,Disney in English and Spanish,5,Hotcoldwater,False,"When I downloaded the app and saw many of the Disney classics from my childhood I was beyond happy. However, I was super excited to see that when I added the Disney app on my Spanish speaking parents TV all the shows were in Spanish. That is beyond a pleasant surprise!! It’s great that my whole family can enjoy the Disney movies and shows in both languages... tear, tear. I purchased Disney movies digitally in the past from other streaming providers and they are only in English so to have both languages is amazing!! I’m sure since Disney is global they might offer other languages as well just haven’t checked since I don’t speak any other. Enjoy watching! Disfruten las peliculas!"
2020-01-07 04:01:08,One problem,5,Somus 1234,False,"I would recommend this app, and I have to many people. But there is one request I have just for the convenience of me and the other subscribers of Disney+. So basically, if/when I tap continue watching, on another service, it would take me to a separate screen. Say I have Mickey Mouse on my continue watching, and there are lots of episodes to it. If I want to select another episode I have to search up Mickey Mouse then tap on episodes and more. If you were taken to this screen where you could choose episodes, (Netflix does this) it would be great. But overall, quality content and much better UI (user interface) than others."
2019-11-18 21:29:42,Almost perfection...just missing 1 thing,5,hales.add,False,"I love this streaming service. Me being a 90’s baby, I already started watching all the classic Disney Channel Original series/movies. HOWEVER, please add a “Continue Watching” queue!! It’s needed!! It would make this service perfect. I find it necessary in all streaming services. I hate having to search and hunt for the episode I left off on. It’s troublesome to have to remember which episodes and movies I started. This would be a super helpful addition. I’m actually quite surprised Disney would forget(or more-so, choose to forgo) this feature in their app, especially having had some of the biggest/smartest moves and business deals in the industry."
2019-11-17 20:08:43,"Nice, but needs additional features",3,josborne31,False,"I’m enjoying some of the movies and tv shows that became available with the subscription for this app. 
I took a few stars off due to the missing features I would expect from a streaming app. 
There isn’t a “currently playing” list, allowing me to quickly return to shows I was watching. That means I am forced to search by title more frequently than I’d like. 
There isn’t any indication that I’ve already begun watching a show. If someone else watched 30 minutes of a movie, and I begin watching it, it starts at the 30 minute mark. I’d like the option to resume watching or start at the beginning. 
Because Disney has a _lot_ of animation, I’d really like an option to choose between animation or live action. Even if it were a toggle, it’d help significantly."
2020-07-14 17:32:00,Video keeps zooming in on iPhone 7,3,Millville NJ,False,"A few days ago the Disney + app started blowing up the image of a movie from its normal widescreen aspect ratio till where it fills up the screen and I can barely see the subtitles.  I found tapping the screen with three fingers gets the image to go back to its normal size, but if I close that movie and come back to continue watching, the movie is zoomed in again and I again have to tap the screen with three fingers to get it to zoom back to normal. 

At first I thought that my phone’s zoom setting was on in the accessibility settings, but it was not turned on. Plus no other video app on my phone is doing this.   This is only happening in the Disney plus app. I verified that my wife’s iPhone 7 is also zooming in the image as well. 

Very annoying"
2020-05-13 21:41:33,Can’t play downloaded video via hdmi,3,apple11,False,"Good content but my biggest gripe is the inability to use an HDMI cable to connect to a larger TV and play already downloaded content. When I go on trips, I like to download videos to my iPad ahead of time and bring an HDMI cable to connect to the hotel TV (bigger screen for the family to watch a movie). However, I’ve discovered the downloaded content has a digital content protection program that won’t allow downloaded content to be streamed to a TV via an Apple lightning to HDMI adapter. Yes I could use the hotel WiFi, but it’s really not that fast and slow internet affects the quality of the movie, hence why I download it ahead of time. So until these restrictions are lifted from content that’s already downloaded to the iPad, I can’t give this app 5 stars."
2020-04-07 14:39:25,"Had it for months, rarely able to use it",2,Redsticker,False,"The content is amazing but I can RARELY get the app to work. (I’ve successfully used it maybe 4 times since its release.) I don’t have WiFi, only unlimited cell data, and it constantly tells me that there’s no internet... even though my other streaming services work just fine. I tried downloading the shows when there’s wifi available to watch later, and it still doesn’t work. Tried logging out and logging back in. Tried deleting and reinstalling. Nothing. So I basically have to go to someone’s else’s house or loiter on public WiFi just to use something that costs $6.99 per month. Thankfully, Verizon is paying for my subscription for the year... and after months and months of a broken app and terrible service with no fixes, I won’t be renewing it on my own dime."
2020-01-14 18:23:18,Disney Plus Bundle Rip Off,1,PieroLeon,False,"So I went to get the bundle for ESPN+ and put in my information. Well since the Disney+ account is under my wife’s email and not my email I don’t qualify for the discount and have to pay full price, even though I’m the one that has the Verizon account that qualifies us for a 1 year free subscription and pays for the account.  Then when I called for some assistance I was hold, on and off for about 10 mins with the call lasting a total of 30 mins only for a supervisor lady named “Jay” to tell me “well since you just created an account under your email it’s in our system now and can’t change it.” So now I already paid for it upfront (because apparently they don’t refund or pro-rate) and if i want to get the bundle i have to repay for it under my wife’s account. And the help screens that appear when you try to sign up give ZERO details on how to properly sign up. It just says SIGN UP."
2019-12-28 06:52:28,"Good, but some bugs need to be fixed",4,T-ZER0,False,"The variety of movies and tv shows on this app are great . But this app is missing shows like Mighty Med, Gamer’s Guide or even my personal favorite Aaron Stone!

That’s not the bugs however, I’m sure they will add them in time. What I would love is a better processor for when I skip back on a video. When I press the button to skip back ten seconds, the pause and skip buttons vanish and are replaced by the buffer icon. Which can only be fixed by dragging the cursor to the position. I would also like the ability to view your watch history and a more obvious way of showing which episodes of which show you watched. Like Prime Video does.

I would like those fixed, but it’s still worth it."
2019-11-17 02:34:36,Love it but something is missing!,4,HilaryS2011,False,"I love this app and that I get to introduce my kids to the best movies like Swiss Family Robinson and the Apple Dumpling Gang and all the old Mickey Mouse cartoons. Those were the best cartoons! I wish there was a “continue watching” option and also playback mode. I don’t always remember where I was and I would like that as an option. I like how I can pick and choose what my kids watch. However, I’m disappointed that they are going to censor all the old movies for racial and discrimination things. I use those as teaching moments and I firmly believe we need those in life. I can pause the movie, talk about what they said or how they acted, discuss a better way for that situation to have been handled and then continue with the movie."
2019-11-17 05:32:49,Not compatible with any smart tv older than 2016,1,Insearchforgreatapps,False,"I was so excited to download the app on my Samsung 2015 curved 4K smart tv just to find out that you have to have a 2016 or newer. I love Disney, but not enough to go out & spend a couple thousand dollars on a newer smart tv just to watch it’s awesome programming on top of the monthly subscription. Disney is sending an awful message to it’s fans. Apparently you have to be middle upper class to afford the tv models it’s compatible with. I could get it on my phone or iPad. But is the expectación that everyone huddle around a tiny screen to enjoy family programming? When you try to mirror it to your “antique “ 4 year old tv, it just freezes. I spent a couple hours troubleshooting it online (more wasted time) just to find out that Disney hasn’t even bothered to comment on the matter or clarify when the public can expect for it to become available to the average person."
2019-11-20 22:13:08,Almost perfect,4,Jello163782827636372,False,"The content is amazing and has almost every Disney show or movie I could think of! My only issue is it can be hard to find them on the app. There aren’t very many categories and not all the content is on the main page. Also your watchlist isn’t on the main page either and the shows you add won’t stay added to your watchlist and keep disappearing. There also isn’t a continue watching category, so if I leave and come back it’s easy to forget what I was in the middle of watching when it disappears. Still, the content is amazing and it’s easy to use the search bar to find what you’re looking for. I love this app and can’t wait for them to work out the little kinks!"
2020-01-29 04:58:11,I really dislike the new Disney,3,butholejohn,False,"I really dislike Disney I understand that you are try to appeal to the younger generation but please understand that I 14 I still have a lot of kid in me I just ask the you recreate the movies and tv show’s that we love such as “ let it shine ,wizards of waverly place and ,camp rock and many more “. I know you don’t care about comments like this because you have to much money to care about a kid but we all want to make the world better but without love and laughter and hope of happy life how can we live and make life better . And if by any chance you remake them please use that money to make good content and not have them end up like All That because believe it or not I cry thinking about my childhood being gone and I’m on 14 but think you for you time and good day ."
2020-01-07 01:38:56,Seriously underwhelming,1,Critical app user,False,"It surprises me that a major media corporation would be comfortable publishing such a poorly performing app.  Streaming media technology is sufficiently mature that any company should be capable of providing an app that remembers where a viewer left off, provides easy access to frequently viewed programs, and allows the user to intuitively add/remove items from the watchlist.

Additionally, the push by this and other companies to only allow access to content if the end-user compromises his/her network security by disabling VPN services should be illegal.  The premise that “we need to know end-user locations due to licensing restrictions” simply doesn’t hold up when companies create their own streaming services to push their own content (which, presumably, they have a license to distribute).  

Even though streaming media is in a sorry state, I would be ashamed if I had any contribution to this particular app."
2019-12-24 02:26:42,Love/Hate Relationship,3,Kodiak409,False,"I love Disney Plus but I’d love it more if I could watch it. Despite all the apps and my Apple TV being updated, the Disney Plus shows will play with no problem on my phone but the moment I attempt to airplay it to the Apple TV it has an errors out about 60% of the time I try to connect it. Some nights it’s just not my night. Other nights I have no problem and it airplay’s without an issue. My Apple TV is the updated original version (so not the fancier newer model... don’t keep up with Apple TV generations. Mine might be gen3 or something). Either way, it’s inconsistent. I’ve checked my connection speed but it’s fantastic at about 50Mbps download and 40Mbps upload. So honestly at this point I blame the app as airplay doesn’t seem to have the same struggles with any other app."
2019-11-15 02:22:59,"Great, but lacking a couple things",3,Nextguy12,False,"The app is great so far, and I hope it only improved from here, but I noticed a few things that take away from the viewing experience. The app lacks a currently watching feature and a tag on each video to tell you how far you are. Without a place mark in certain shows, viewers can lose their place when watching the series and that would be very frustrating. A good amount of shows are still missing from the platform that could garner more subscribers such as Pair of Kings, Dog with a Blog, Ant Farm, and many many cartoon shows. Without a diverse selection from properties that you already own, the app will soon get boring once people watch the few popular shows that are on the platform.
Other than that, this is a great app!"
2019-11-27 16:27:17,Things needed for improving the app,5,spiritgirl131,False,"Disney plus has been great at first I was really upset that they were taking all the stuff from Netflix but the layout of Disney plus is stunning something they should add when the new update comes out is: a continue watching area. I hate that if I leave the app for a while and come back to finish what I was watching that I have to go search for it again that’s ridiculous and makes me irritated. It’s really a great tool. Another thing is all of the marvel movies should be on Disney plus not just the recent ones or just the iron man 1,2,3. But I think that overall Disney plus is an excellent app. Make sure u keep Netflix to tho."
2019-11-19 14:50:33,Horrible Service,1,Vullrex,False,"Disney Plus really shows how much they care about their customers through their customer service, which is very non-existent. I have sent in multiple emails and have tried their online help multiple times (waited over an hour all the times when the estimated wait was under 30 minutes) and have not had any luck or had any response on the email front and it’s almost been a week since I submitted my first email. The website is a joke since you can’t even update your information which is all I’ve been trying to do and get my service sorted out correctly. It’s very asinine and totally unprofessional how they are handling things (Apparently not at all). I understand they have a high call volume right now but seriously almost a week has gone by without any word from them and they say they will typically respond within 24 hours. Yeah what a joke!"
2020-09-05 13:46:22,Disney+ Pros and Cons,5,DisneyDork2020,False,"I absolutely LOVE Disney+. The only problem is language. I wanted to watch the new Mulan (which was awesome) with premier access in Chinese. Though the movie was filmed in China and there is a Disneyland in Shanghai, the movie was not available in Mandarin Chinese or Cantonese. If possible, I’d appreciate if you could fix this. Not just for me, but for everyone. That way more people can watch it from all over the world. Other than that, Disney+ has proved to be amazing for the whole family! We continue to stream on it and enjoy exclusive shows like the Mandalorian. Thank you for making an app that has access to so many Disney, Pixar, Star Wars, Marvel, Fox, and National Geographic movies!"
2020-01-19 17:10:17,Money grab without functionality,3,Crosamich,False,"I think the ratings reflect content more than the actual app. One of the leading media companies in the world, if not the leading by $$ alone, launches an app too soon in order to pump their stock and get baby yoda into the world before Christmas. Buffering issues galore and don’t tell me it’s my service speed. Lack of basic functionality of other streaming apps that have been around for years (resume play would be the most glaring missing option). Have to play to the end to rewatch something on Apple TV.  Even the search algorithm is flawed. I dub this rollout as rudimentary, and that still seems like a gift. I’ll fix it for y’all - Netflix...copy them. 
I’ll give a positive of the categories at top of page to delineate Star Wars from Disney, etc"
2019-11-26 04:08:30,"I Love It, But I Have One Suggestion",5,Adeline O.,False,"Okay I finally downloaded this app and I freaking love it!!! The nostalgia of all of the old Disney movies, the old shows—god, I just started watching Kim Possible last night and I love it!!—and all of the Marvel and Star Wars content that will keep me happy for the rest of my existence! I ask only one thing, a Recently Watched tab. I would love to be able to just find what I was watching under a Recently Watched tab on the home page. It’d be slightly more convenient than going into my watchlist and finding where I left off. It’s a minor thing that I’m confident will be resolved in the future but I’m just grateful to be able to have this app!"
2019-11-21 00:30:37,Instant Classic but app needs update,4,jvallines,False,"I love EVERYTHING about this service. I grew up watching most of the content provided. It's nostalgia at its finest; I get to not only re-live my childhood, but I can now share this with my children and as well. With everything provided, the minor inconveniences of the app can be overlooked. There is no recently played or continue feature like other streaming services. I am currently watching a show where I have to go into my profile then to watchlist click on the show and search for the season and episode. Not the end of the world, but after a while, it will become annoying. For now, that is my only gripe with the app; everything else is magic that only Disney could provide!"
2019-11-20 06:04:07,AUTOPLAY ISSUES,2,KalaLee25,False,"My rating is based on the app itself, not the content, because Evens Stevens is gold. App needs a “continue watching” list. Also, if you rewatch an episode of a series, it ALWAYS begins at the end credits! I watch on an Apple TV and have to manually rewind each episode that I’m rewatching. Then I expect the next episode to automatically play, even if I’ve already watched the entire series, but nope. It stops and waits for me to press the “play next episode” button on every single episode if it’s been previously viewed. When I do hit the “play next episode” button, it begins at the end credits again and I have to rewind to watch from the beginning. Fix the autoplay function!! Seriously, I’ve spent thousands of dollars taking trips to Disneyland and Disney World over the last 20 years. You have the money to do better than this, Disney."
2019-11-14 07:27:46,Heating up/crashing phone,5,Tat-wolf,False,"Not mad since it’s so close after launch and there bound to be bugs but just to make devs aware that as soon as loading up a movie on here, my phone heated up like crazy (never happens watching any other media or on anything else) and then the screen didn’t sense my finger, so I couldn’t pause. Eventually I went home and nothing would load so I turned my phone completely off then on and it fixed it, but my phone is sill cooling off from it. Wondering if anyone else has had this issue. Other than that the app is pretty great, I love the theme and title choices, and all the oldies added on, will be busy on here for awhile ;)"
2020-05-01 18:38:00,Beware of the subscription,5,gjjkjkljgdak,False,Download  Disney+  it's great but beware there is a subscription you need to buy to have access to it all but it has categories and a lot of fun movies and TV shows to watch you can decorate your profile and I think it’s Awesome 😎 I have it on my TV and I am definitely going to sign in when it’s done loading  also if you got Disney now then I think you might want to delete it because I heard that they are going to take away Disney now soon because of Disney+ I don’t know if it’s true but it could happen so do you wanna watch fun TV shows and movies made by Disney on Disney+ get it now for free with a subscription inside bye 👋
2020-01-16 22:15:42,Really good app,5,Steeler fan 19,False,I love the app there is only one problem with it you might be woundering why i did not give it four stars if there is a problem with it the reason why everything else tops my problem i am having is that there is over 100 shows and movies and there is all good kinds of choices i am a mystery and action type of guy my brother likes all kinds so what i am saying is that it has shows for everyone not just a guy who likes everything my problem is i have a ipad and it is a so little screen and sometimes when i click on it it moves to the bottem sides or top so i would really appreciate it if you could fix that
2019-11-22 18:11:58,PLEASE Make a “Continue Watching” Feature,3,Mad at Snap Chat,False,"Love Disney+ so far! So much great content that I didn’t even think they would imagine to include like the Disney shorts. This app randomly crashes on me sometimes however, seemingly for no reason. This wouldn’t bother me as much (because it doesn’t crash on me too often) if there was a continue watching feature. Not only do I have to hunt down what I was watching, but I also have to figure out what episode I was in. Usually it will take me back to the place I was in in the episode but sometimes I even have to fast forward and look for the spot at which I left off. This is also the same issue when you voluntarily leave a movie or episode of a show; you have to go searching to resume where it was left off."
2019-11-20 05:17:34,GREAT!!,5,Idalis N,False,"Honestly this is probably the highlight of 2019. Everything i’ve been wanting to watch is here!! Soo cool how they have all the star wars movies and Marvel!!!! This app for great for all ages. They even included national geographic, AWESOME! 

Only thing i wish for is the ‘currently watching’ option. That is definitely needed & useful with platforms like theses. It’s annoying having to search for the show all the time. Also, it would help if it marked watched episodes so we know where we are in a series instead of guessing haha we all know how we like to binge and maybe fall asleep haha. 

Overall, it’s a really great app and i highly recommend. This is where it’s at. Hope it helps xoxo"
2019-11-12 14:18:42,Not all inclusive,4,JustOleJD,False,"First off, there is a lot of great content on Disney+. That said, there are some things that it doesn’t have that is a little disappointing. Disney purchased Lucasfilm, but none of the Indiana Jones content is included, nor other Lucasfilm content. The original Clone Wars cartoons that appeared as shorts on Cartoon Network are not here, and I do not mean the Ahsoka-containing ones, rather the ones prior to that line of shows. American Graffiti and Howard the Duck, for example are missing among others. You can find National Geographic, but not ABC content, which is a Disney property. If Disney combined all their apps into one (Disney+, ESPN+, ABC), it would be the best service available, in my opinion. Still, my kids will enjoy the content it does currently have."
2019-11-19 21:55:18,Concerns!,3,SierraLL,False,"I love Disney movies and was excited to hear about this new app! I love seeing multiple movies available to watch including the sequels. 

My concerns start when I see “Out of the Vault” which includes The Little Mermaid, Jungle Book, Cinderella, etc. Will these movies be taken off this app after so long? Also why limit the movies? I noticed the new Lady and The Tramp is available to watch, but where is The Lion King, and Beauty and The Beast? I would think since this is a Disney app, it would have every single Disney movie out. 

I’ll keep this about a month and see if any new movies will be added, but if not I will let the app go. I already have a lot of movies that I can just watch over without paying $8. monthly. This app just makes it a little easier and more convenient."
2019-11-18 13:42:21,Decent for a first attempt,3,Steel Cor,False,"Considering the work Disney put into this service and the many streaming apps that came before it, I expected more.  The app is clean, and the studio hot buttons are helpful, but is not without issues: 
- There is no way to see what you last watched or a way to jump back into the last couple items where you left off.  You have to recall what you were watching, find it, then go back to where you were.
- The Watch List is buried in the menu rather than being a category of its own, so it takes a few clicks to find.  
- The Watch List has no sorting capability, such as by title or recently watched.  It's hard to find anything.
- Any shows and movies added to the Watch List don't show the checkmark that it's already added when you revisit the show.  This makes creating the list impossible.  Titles are listed under several categories, so you will likely forget if you added it already.  If it's already in the list and you add it to the list again, it actually removes it from the list.

Fixes too the Watch List and a recently watched/unfinished feature are desperately needed to reduce the experience frustration."
2020-01-13 17:10:30,Ehhhhhh,4,CTlover05,False,"I LOVE Disney movies. I haven’t even been using this app for a week, and there are already issues with it. 1) I downloaded some movies to watch and I was half way through a movie when it stopped and I couldn’t keep watching. I had to exit the app and go back in and it was still not working. It let me watch any of the other movies I had downloaded, but not this one. 2) once I was finally able to finish the movie, it told me I had no downloads, which I know for a fact was not true. All my downloads were gone but were still taking up storage on my iPad. This makes me really mad because I had quite a few movies downloaded. If you could try to fix it, that would be amazing."
2019-12-18 16:12:17,Love it but few bugs,4,rllavona,False,"I just love Disney++ and i am enjoying everything. I got issues with low volume when streaming to my Samsung TV, not matter what app i use(xbox,Samsung, iOS) the volume is very low. Also i would love to be able to go to next episode or previous one in the actual stream i think it needs more navigation features in the stream window. Also is difficult to see what was your last episode watched and would be nice too that you can see the episodes that you already watched marked, another idea is to have the movies for example Star Wars in order because i have to go back to home do a search and find the next movie that follows. But overall good fine job dev team!!"
2019-11-23 21:43:39,Amazing Content with minor layout issues,4,Grady Camp,False,"The shows and movies included with Disney plus are amazing, but here are a few things that should be addressed concerning the layout of the app. First and most importantly, a “continue watching” section would be extremely useful and make the app much easier to navigate. It would also be very useful to have a description of what each show is as well as casting information for it. Finally, I’m sure this will soon be fixed also, but there a still a few shows missing that I would love to see come to Disney plus. I’m loving this app and hope to continue to see it grow and develop into something even better with future updates!"
2019-11-20 16:50:02,Love everything but the watchlist,4,cPIPER1268,False,"I love everything about this app but the watchlist caps you off at how many shows you can add to it and instead of telling it’s full or being able to add unlimited shows to the watchlist it just replaces and removes other shows without your knowledge. See I love the watch list because instead of searching through all the stuff I don’t watch I can just add it to my watch list and know that everything I want to see or love to watch is right there, but with it capping at how many shows you can add and auto removing others so you can add other is mehh so I think a simple small fix of being able to add unlimited shows and movies to the watch list would be awesome."

I was planning on paying for it anyways. Now I can’t even log in. Fix it Disney. I am highly disappointed by the lack of effort y’all put into this app. I was iffy about the fact that it doesn’t show you your recently watched and now this? I should be able to open this app and click on whatever I was previously watching to resume it. Now that this error keeps popping up, I can’t even log back into my account. I share this account with one other person, I shouldn’t have trouble like this. I don’t know what you want me to do. Your help section was not helpful at all whatsoever. Though I do appreciate the whole concept of Disney Plus."
2019-11-19 19:24:12,Cool but needs few kinks worked out.,4,MH9813,False,"Disney+ is awesome and ik it just released and has some kinks to be worked out anyways. Some of the things ive noticed while using it, having a “continue watching” section would be awesome and for it to keep track of where I left off instead of playing from the very beginning of the series. Also just a little glitch or something when im scrolling to find something to watch, when i scroll through a category horizontally when i get to one side of my screen it snaps over to the other side of the tv and when you click into something to save it to your “watch list” and go back to keep exploring you have start back at the beginning."
2019-11-16 11:54:00,I agree good but still needs...,4,KedRed,False,I agree with all the reviews that it’s good but it still needs a little bit of work. Having a continue watching area would be so helpful. I accidentally closed the screen during an episode and then had to go searching for the series and then searching for the correct episode I don’t need to continue. I was frustrated and didn’t want to take the time to go through all that so I stopped watching. The episodes really should be marked as to progress so we are able to see which episodes in the series we have watched especially those that will continue to add new episodes if it’s been a while who the heck is going to remember where they left off.
2019-11-30 02:59:53,Love it!,4,Momma Kaee,False,"I have been streaming Disney+ since the moment it was available, but since I have started streaming I have had a severe buffering problem. I cannot watch anything without the show or movie buffering at least 10+ times. I have yet to watch something and it play all the way through without lagging. I’ve talked to several people and some say they have the same problem and others say they don’t... 
Other than that, I absolutely love this app and the fact that I know have the opportunity to watch all of the movies I have been obsessed with since I was a small kid. If I could just get it to wear the content would stop buffering I would probably never get off of this app."

About one or two days after the app came out, my family decided to download it. (we had been looking forward to this for a while now) We all love it!!! I have two very young siblings, and we cast Disney movies to the tv all the time. I normally watch it on my phone, so I can watch shows of my choice. I, myself, I have been looking forward to watching high school musical, the series. With this app, I don't have to wait until Friday to watch it, I can watch it whenever I want!! Thank you so much for reading this, and I recommend this app to everyone!!!"
2020-03-29 23:06:47,One thing that bugs me... A LOT,3,Kiat389,False,"You see I love Disney+, it’s cool. They have tons of Disney movies that Netflix doesn’t have plus shows. They even have short clips. I have had Disney+ for a long time but, whenever I’m watching a show or movie, something happens. That something is that it switches on what side of the screen its on. Sometimes it goes upside down or sideways. Then it goes back after I try to fix it but it gets smaller than my usual screen. After that, it malfunctions and it kicks me out of the app. Disney, I really need you to read this, it has been bugging me for the LONGEST time. Please stop this mess and fix it. That is the only thing that I don’t like about Disney+. In different circumstances it is an amazing app. People should really get it and watch!!!😁😁😄😄❤️❤️"
2020-03-16 01:52:26,I love that I can watch my favorites of all time,3,Ayla121,False,"And enjoy new stuff too. However, I’m one of those people that likes to rewind a part over and over again to watch it over and over again and I don’t like that it is hard to do in all forms of the app be it a gaming console or from my phone. Also would love to have a favorites playlist and a watch later playlist to be an option.

And then there is the issue of it buffering on the gaming console apps like the PS4 or freezes but keeps playing the audio and then when it catches up the scene replays. Another thing is if I want rewind because I’m studying the scene as I sometimes like to do it’ll quit the movie by same “oops something went wrong.” It’s so annoying and I want this to be fixed very badly."
2019-11-23 21:25:18,"Love it. A few Bugs, needs more features",4,ODM4980,False,Overall I love it the app runs really smooth and easy to navigate. It does have a bug though on my phone if I loose my cellular network connection I have to restart my phone in order for the app to recognize any kind of network connection has been restored cellular or WiFi. Also it would be really functional and super convenient if the app had either a tab or a strip category for continue watching that way if you close out the app it’s more convenient to continue watching the video you were last watching (i.e Netflix) otherwise you have to search for it or refind where it was listed otherwise great job Disney overall a great app
2019-11-17 20:24:44,Great App! But Please Fix Some Minor Bugs & Issues,4,JayGotK,False,Overall Your App Is wonderful. But lately it seems like every movie or show i watch just wont load correctly and it freezes and it is very irritating. This happens on both mobile and on my play station 4. Wifi and connection is all good just seems to freeze up. Audio will still play but picture is stuck. Also could you add a continue watching feature? And Maybe categorize the flow of movies better. Ill look through categories and only see certain movies and then when you search i see movies and shows i didn’t even know yall had. I also can’t seem to change quality on ps4 app. Please take this into consideration!
2019-11-18 08:18:23,I hope there’s an update soon,3,Legalseller,False,"Big thanks to the Verizon partnership for the free year! I’ve already watched a couple classics and boy meets world is keeping me company during the late night nursing sessions. 
That being said, there needs to be a continue watching section for series. Even adding something to a watch list doesn’t keep the place. They have profiles but if there isn’t something keeping track, that’s kind of pointless. This is absolutely just an inconvenience but it’s a pretty big one. If you go to the watch list, the series you’re watching is listed but you still have to scroll and try to find where you left off and if you only watch half an episode, it restarts the episode. You have to physically move the watch bar to your spot."
2019-11-15 03:24:01,Disney+ feelings,4,ivymoonmoon,False,"I am really exited about Disney+. It has so many movies that throw me back and I have no issue watching. But it is still new and I think it still has a few things it could improve on. I would suggest a section showing what you have recently been watching and haven’t finished, especially if it’s a show. Maybe adding a favorites section or a way to add to “my list” of things you’d like to watch. I would also really love it if they would add a selection to to captions when you pause the movie. I personally have very poor hearing and I have a hard time watching television without any captions. All around though this is a great app and I’m sure they will address things like this soon"
2020-10-19 15:30:21,Canceling Subscription,1,BlengeSquelch,False,"Honestly the app is nice and I enjoyed having it, but times are hard and I want to cancel my subscription. When I go to my account there isn’t a camel subscription option. I click on billing/payments and I’m redirected to another website that doesn’t even list Disney+ on there. Then I call the customer service number and they don’t even list a cancel option, they say if you signed up thru Apple go thru them. My Netflix is thru Apple and I could easily cancel/ resubscribe with no issues. I’ve never felt so trapped into a subscription. I’m currently on hold with customer service and I haven’t even spoken to a person yet and it’s been 20 mins. It’s like they want to make it hard so in the end you to give up and keep the subscription. This has completely made me not ever want to get Disney again cause they have made it so difficult."

My problem is that we will start the movie and I end up getting the “Oh No!” Something is in error messages either right from the start or right in the middle. 😭 I have excellent internet service on my phone, or even using WiFi... That gets irritating! I even checked if I needed to update my phone or app and everything is fine! I’m not hating it but it be nice to be able to just lay in the bed for a day and watch a kids movie without interrupting them.."

I know they put Hamilton on Disney+, but why stop there? I know because of the virus, I missed watching Dear Evan Hansen, and I was really looking forward to it, after reading the book and listening to the soundtrack. I would love for the people who run Disney+ to add Dear Evan Hansen and some other musicals/plays!! I hope you take my suggestion into consideration especially realizing that millions of people have missed plays they were excited to go to, and this would give them a chance to watch it, although it still would not be the same."

I want to be able to let my young kids watch their favorite shows without worry of them getting to the more adult or older kid content. My kids have learned how to switch profiles and have recently gone on to the Simpsons on my profile. I don’t think this is an appropriate show for my 4 and 5 year olds. So while I can set their profile to specific limits, I can’t control them switching profiles when I’m not looking. I think Netflix finally got it right with how much control parents have. I may end up stopping my subscription if I can’t be worry free of what my kids are watching. Please fix the parental controls! Should be a fairly simple fix!"
2020-08-03 02:14:34,my literal favorite app.🤍,5,SkrtMarks,False,"Hey people that work at disney🥶😂. I love this app so so much!! It’s really cool that i can watch so many of my favorite movies and shows all in one place. Also i LOVE the download feature. So when i’m off wifi, i can watch a show i’ve already downloaded. (i do this a lot😂). And it’s really worth the price as well. And if that wasn’t good enough, there is legit no ads and it keeps you posted when something new comes out!!!!!! OOH one more thing, i love the fact that once a new movie comes out in theaters, you don’t have to wait that long until it comes out here!!! So all in all, the creators of this app are AWESOME and thanks so much!!🤍"
2020-02-12 05:22:47,"Frustrating, but still have faith",4,chilipepperfreak,False,"For a company with so much money, you would think you guys would spend money on working on app functionality. This thing is so incredibly frustrating to use and if it weren’t for the content this would have a much lower rating. Watching movies and shows is unbearable, as they buffer and stop every 5 minutes, the app constantly stops showing I’m even playing anything at all, and I have to continuously close and reopen the app. As of right now this is really not worth the money, but I’m giving it the benefit of the doubt seen as how the app has not been out a super long time. All I’m asking is you use your abundant resources to fix this issue! PLEASE"
2020-01-15 03:39:56,Unable to Pause While Streaming,4,Silvio A.,False,"The app has been great and only thing I’m having an issue with is the inability to pause whatever I’m watching at times. There are moments when I go to pause and the pause symbol shows up along with the other actions, but there are more times when I click my phone screen to pause a movie, say I’m heading to the bathroom really quick, and all that shows is a circle circling around as if buffering. Even when I’m connected to the WiFi, the issue of being unable to briefly pause what I’m watching, continues unless I completely back out of the title I’m watching and then have to resume from the Disney home screen again to continue watching my title."
2020-01-26 21:19:05,I love this app but,5,Meepdudes,False,"The only problem I truly have noticed and kinda have a problem with is some of the shows on the app have some episodes missing or not in order which I know it’s hard to everything perfect and everything it’s just kinda annoying but I’m just trying to watch the shows and then it just skips to a different timeline and I notice it says it’s supposed to be next but normally it shouldn’t. Also I notice some shows don’t have a part 2 after a part 1, like it skipped in the timeline. 

I understand its hard because it’s such a big platform and people make mistakes I just wanted to say this."
2019-12-07 00:23:01,"Great app, but could be better",4,jade225,False,"I love this streaming service and I’ve watched little else since I got it. My biggest complaint is when I try to re-watch episodes of the Madalorian. If I go back and re-watch the first episode, things are fine. Then afterwards it skips all the way to the most recent episode. But then when I specifically choose episode 2, it’ll skip (again) to the most recent episode. It did this all night and refused to play episodes 2 & 3. Granted I’d already watched them, but I’ve never had this happen with any of the other streaming services. Very, very frustrating. Fix this. If I click a specific episode, it should play that episode followed by the one after that."

But..,5,Serious_Muffin18,False,"Okay so I’m a huge fan of Disney, but when I’m watching something it sometimes glitches me out of the whole app, and have have a apple and its new, so I don’t think it’s my iPad, but I love all the movies on it, but I hate when the continue watching thing glitches out and I have nothing there, then I have to restart the whole series or movie, or even skip through it, most likely watch it again cause I love Disney- ok I’m off topic! But my sister has problems changing accounts, so she has to watch on my account, and it gets frustrating when she watches my stuff. This is a great app though and I will using this a lot more! ❤️❤️❤️"

Second, I find that not all marvel Star Wars, nat geo, etc have been like having big problems. Their good, but issues may very. First not all the good stuff is on it! Oh my gosh guys DEVELOPERS ATTENTION GUYS I LOVE THIS APP SO MUCH I WATCH IT 24/7 BUT I CANNOT STAND THE STUPID STUFF... Thanks. So I know I’m kinda sounding like a negative weirdo, but this app is awesome.. I can’t stop watching High School Musical The Musical: The series, Lab Rats, and The Mandalorian! Guys I wish all you good luck to fix this! Thank you so much and Disney+ 4ever! :) I’m not done yet. I have more. 24 hours later... UGH."
2019-12-16 02:08:01,Disney+ is magical,5,JJmazeyGaming,False,"Nothing beats the feeling of being a kid again. We grow up and often forget the good times of the past. This app offers that. I like having the opportunity of watch films I haven’t seen in 6+ years. Films of likes of Wall-e, Narnia, Herbie, etc. It is amazing to see the Disney magic of the past. I have honestly fallen in love with some of these movies. Watching them bring back warm memories. I can remember the toys, the house, the couches, and the food I had. I can even remember the play sessions I had. Disney to some extent has lost that magic that they once had. You don’t see films like that anymore. This allows you to re-visit the joys of the past."
2019-11-17 07:05:04,Love it but needs improvement,4,CocoLocoCRB,False,"I love that most of the Disney movies are available but there are things in the app that need to improve. There is no ""currently watching"" section. Everytime I leave the app I have to search for what I was watching and it's very inconvenient. Also there is no option to start a movie over from the beginning if you happen to be at the credits or just want to start it over from any point. I have repeat watchers in the house and they complain that they can't just start the movie from the beginning. First they have to fast forward through all the credits and then hit play. Other then that love the app. Can't wait until all Disney movies are accessible."
2019-11-14 23:35:31,"So amazing, but please address",4,Smk8503,False,"The app and its content is absolutely amazing! Just left me wondering where to begin on my binge-watching! The only complaint I have about the app is the same as I saw some others write in their review: the app doesn’t visibly show where you left off watching. I started binge-watching The Runaways, and am frustrated that when I take a break between episodes, and come back later, I have to find the last one I watched. I get that you weren’t trying to make an exact duplicate of other streaming services, however, the masses are used to having the app show them where they left off. Seems a bit of an oversight to have left a feature like that out completely."
2019-11-14 06:52:29,My Childhood One App,4,ESL Inferno,False,"Literally so overwhelm that I don’t know what to watch first! Thank you Disney!

This app literally can appeal to just about every age group with classic movies and shows, but even newer ones 😊 The reason I rate it a 4 star is because it’s a bit glitchy at times, I’m sure it will be fix soon. Also, I hope they will add continue watching on TV shows, it’s a bit annoying having to add stuff watch list and then go search through the list. Also hope they add a bit more personalization such as suggesting tv shows and movies on the front page based on what we’ve recently watch. Other than that this app is a god send for use adults reliving our childhoods and the young kids 👀"
2020-07-15 04:19:26,Amazing but tiny problem...,4,*-.Moon Flower.-*,False,"i have this app on my phone and i absolutely love it! it has all my favorite Disney shows and movies, along with ones made by Disney + (i think that makes sense) but I noticed that lately the screen has been closer than what the original would be. like i have watched Hamilton 3 times but on my fourth time , as in this time, it seems to be closer than normal and the characters upper face usually are covered by the top of the screen. i haven’t noticed it on any others but still. im not bothered a lot by it, i just kinda want it fixed. but since im on phone, I might have done something to do that so if you could write me back to see if i can fix it? thank you!!!"
2020-05-28 14:03:21,Regions,4,schway12,False,"Look, I lived in the U.S for 3 years and Disney+ came out  a couple months before I came back to Brazil. I loved it. It gad so many movies and show But I can’t ignore the fact that Disney is only giving privilege to Americans. Rise of Skywalker is out on Disney+ but since I’m in Brazil I can’t watch it. And it’s so freaking stupid because we’re in QUARANTINE. I need to watch all of the Star Wars movies and the Clone Wars. Netflix doesn’t have many movies I like anymore since Disney bought so many movie companies. And you might be thinking “Disney + is coming to Brazil in November” yeah bro, but we’re in quarantine and I’m bored. And if Disney is so money hungry, the why aren’t they letting people in other countries get Disney+? Thank you for your time."
2020-06-08 01:54:29,Adding more things,5,hotbdgd jdn,False,"Hi, I love disney plus and I know you guys are trying to add more and more content every day.  One of the things I came across is that you didn’t have yet one of the Mickey Mouse shows. The house of mouse (aired in about 2001) wasn’t there, including its two movies. I was wondering if you guys were going to add, it but you don’t have access or own it anymore.  Will you ever be able to add mickeys house of mouse (television show) and mickeys house of mouse Christmas special and the Halloween special? Over all, I love Disney plus and I think that it is amazing all of the options it gives to watch! I also think the workers at Disney+ do an amazing job."
2020-05-18 12:33:36,VERY VERY VERY VERY GOOD STREAMING APP,4,bwinksisabunny,False,"This is was such and amazing app right from the start and still is today. The only reason I say you’re competing with Netflix is because if your menu. It is very complex, confusing, and frustrating I wish you would please upgrade the menu (and the logo please🥺.)
I can’t believe that Disney Plus doesn’t have Mighty Med because that is a well known Disney XD show and it’s not on there. It has Lab Rats and Elite Force but not Mighty Med.
I didn’t even know that Elite Force was a show until Disney Plus came out and I can’t watch Lab Rats vs Mighty Med part 2 or watch Elite Force because Mighty Med isn’t on Disney Plus. It’s still a amazing app thank you for all of the people at Disney For making this such an amazing app"
2020-01-21 04:49:09,Awesome app! But there’s just one problem....,4,Kattycupcake1,False,"Hi! First off let me just say I love this app! It has shows/ movies from older times and more recent! It’s very enjoyable. There’s one thing I find a bit frustrating. I mainly use Disney+ on my phone and after about 5 mins or so, the pause but begins to load. It has the Disney + loading symbol in it place. Because of this I can’t pause my show. And it doesn't go away after a bit it just stays there.  To fix this I have to close out of my show and then re play it constantly this can get very aggravating as it happens A LOT throughout the one episode. This app still is great! But it would be much more enjoyable if you could please fix this problem."
2019-11-18 06:24:15,Almost perfect,4,Cm318,False,"As others are mentioning, there definitely is a lacking feature that would make viewing so much easier!! There really needs to be a “recently watched” or “currently watching” list/section to make it easier when one has to step away from viewing for a bit but wants to pick up where we left off. So far I’m seeing that if I stop watching and come back I have to search for what I was watching and then it doesn’t even save where I was, but I have to try to find my place. 
Other than this, I’m loving the variety of content, especially for the initial launch. if they can fix the issues I mentioned it would probably be a 5-star review."
2019-11-12 07:57:03,"Excited, but my watch list didn’t save",4,Tina1376,False,"Excited that it is finally here! It seems to have almost everything. I even searched for a few obscure titles. Some were there, others not, but those were more for nostalgia than quality.
There’s a Muppet quick search I found, but Muppets Take Manhattan and Muppets In Space aren’t there. I have a young child, so those will be somewhat missed.

I made a second account for my daughter and saved a few titles to her watch list. However, after adding many titles to the primary account’s list and checking it, none of them saved. 
Hopefully they’ll show up on the watchlist when I truly check out the app with the family tomorrow evening."
2019-11-17 02:50:08,Great content offering. Too many troubles to access it.,1,Reik for life,False,"I decided to get the 7 day trial to see if I liked the app and what it offered. A couple days in I decided that I liked it and upgraded to the bundle. Now I can’t login to the app because for some reason it’s recognizing the trial and my bundle upgrade as 2 different accounts and asks me to contact customer service. After over 2 hours on hold I get an automated system notifying me that they couldn’t take my call and to call another time, after more than 2 hours on hold. Simultaneously I tried contacting customer service through the live chat and it has been 3 hours since it’s been “trying to connect me to an agent”. 
Good enough content, Horrible customer service, And overall unpreparedness. They should’ve really made sure they were ready before launching the service because they’re clearly not."
2019-11-16 09:24:34,Great app only one problem,1,goof butt,False,"I give this app 5 stars bc the problem isn’t a huge one.. I love this app for multiple reasons.. it had many throw back movies.. from the original movies like cow belles, don’t look under the bed, poof point, smart house, twitches... to thingns like star struck, high school musical and frozen... even the newer ones like freaky Friday and zombies.. it also ya many throw back shows from that’s so raven, Phil of the the future, phinease and ferb, even Stevens, and the suite life of zack and Cody and it’s spin off to the new high school musical series, ravens home, bizardvark etc. it even had crash and Bernstein and best friends whenever. It’s also for a reasonable price. Only $7 a month and it has no adds. Think of it like a cheaper Netflix but this one has a whole lot of childhood classics as well. The only problem is it doesn’t have fishhooks, or Ant Farm.. get those and I will be extremely happy."
2019-11-13 16:48:48,Horrible app! Great content!,1,gOLdEn_gOd,False,"We all know Disney has great content. But the app  is a whole different story. I am not referring to the server errors as that is understandable initially. But it is mind boggling how Disney got the basics of a steaming app so wrong. For starters, although minor, the watchlist section in the IPhone app is located within the profile tab. The watchlist needs to be easier to access. In fact, I thought the watchlist section was missing until I stumbled across it in the profile tab. Also, it seems Disney assumed their viewers will watch an entire movie or episode in one sitting all the time because every time you stop a movie/episode and get back to it later it starts from the beginning! And this is after you locate the show you want to get back to since there is no section for recently viewed items. The app team at Disney needs to fix this fast!!!"
2019-11-13 05:22:56,Amazing service,5,Adriane1982,False,"This app is amazing. I bought it because of the movies and shows that my son loves. Now I can’t get off because I love them too. Our movie nights are going to be awesome because the quality is just superb. I bought the 1 yr plan because the price is super cheap. I would have gladly paid double the price. 

The movie selection is great because it has all the original super movies like cars, wall-e, inside out, chicken little, hocus pocus, finding Nemo, Cinderella etc. I am super happy with this buy. 

I hope this gets enough traction that Disney will start producing more original shows for the adults. I can’t wait to see what’s next! Thanks Disney!"
2020-07-31 15:04:29,A passage into the world of Disney for the entire family,4,Abercrombie_1892,False,"I love the app and its extraordinary content... Marvel, Lucas, Nag Geo, Fox and of course everything from Pixar and Disney... full of classics.

Within the app, navigation can improve, and it’s ridiculous how some short (2-6 minute) cartoons have over three minutes of credits. My child gets frustrated with this issue and I can’t be there all the time to fast forward after each short episode. Also the time between episodes is too long for small children, it should be customizable.
Because of the above annoyances, I am not giving five stars until they are addressed.
Disney you need to work on these small issues ASAP"
2019-11-24 00:58:00,"Great app, but missing a few things.",4,Bria_26,False,"I love this app, the price is fair, but it has a few missing features. First, I wish there was a “continue the magic tab”, where all the tv shows and movies I have watched recently are there so I don’t have to search for them. Second, I wish there was Disney XD and Disney Junior on the app. It is part of the Disney experience, and should be included. Finally, there are a lot of missing movies in the Disney original movies section. Like “16 wishes”,  these movies are made by Disney and should be included. These things can all be fixed, so I still recommend this app to anyone who has the money. The app is very easy to use, and I hope that the app will only improve."
2020-06-12 16:35:45,Disney + is perfect for absolutely anyone!!!,5,Bob the funny goat,False,"There is so much diversity within the categories of movies on Disney +. This pleasantly surprised me!!! There are tons of classics, heart warming movies, action packed movies, and documentaries. The Simpson’s is also on Disney + which is fantastic. I also wanted to comment on how quick the downloads downloaded for me. They have EVERYTHING able to download for offline use and it downloads far faster than any other entertainment app. I downloaded 27 things in literally 10 minutes. I was amazed!!! Disney + is not only perfect for the child at heart, but the one who loves morals, action, and adventure. I highly suggest getting this app!!!"
2020-02-12 15:26:16,Of Course Disney+ is Great! But Why Can’t it Operate Better?,3,iamsamsothere,False,"Content is what you’d expect, all your favorites, which is a no brainer.
Functionality is really low rent though. When I’m watching a show it doesn’t let my phone turn off after like Netflix does. Just stays on the ending of whatever it was I was watching - draining my battery. 
There is also something very odd about this too, because if I fall asleep watching a movie on Disney+ with headphones in — MY MORNING ALARM WILL NOT SOUND and I oversleep. It’s crazy! I have even set up multiple alarms to see what would happen - still NO morning alarm. I just have to make sure to not watch Disney+ if I may fall asleep and miss waking in the morning. Fail. 
I def use this app less because of functionality problems."
2019-12-25 14:42:16,Are there any devs?,1,Fiyaburn,False,"I’ve been using this app for a while, and I had it about 2 weeks after launch, and it was chalk full of glitches. I was contempt with all the glitches at first, cause I understood it was a new app, and it needed time to polish. Almost 2 months in now, not even a single glitch has been fixed. And no glitch is just a small glitch, I’ve had plenty of glitches each and every time I open the app, almost always more than a few glitches each time I use it. I’ve gotten into a system that cleans out a glitch each time I face one, and it’s super tedious and takes away from the movie watching experience. It’s super frustrating, and it feels like no ones overseeing this app. My hope is that I’m just being impatient, and that the devs are working out each individual bug and are going to fix all of them in one giant update."
2019-12-01 03:45:07,Meh,2,UnicornNerd982,False,"I like the app but I do have plenty of issues.

   Literally bought a subscription to watch a show to find out not all of the episodes are there... Same with movies? Some titles are there but then when you try to watch they aren’t available.

   Then the app itself is hard to navigate and the subtitles are harder to read than say the subtitles on Netflix because they aren’t all in the same spot.

   Also the app doesn’t save watch progress? That’s just plain annoying. I shouldn’t have to scroll through frames just to find where I was watching before I exited or it kicked me out.

   I am aware that this is a really new service, but I probably won’t be keeping it. My family bought it so we could all use it, but I am the only one who can. They do not want to watch things on their phones or computers, but that’s all they can do because of limited systems. We have a smart tv that it won’t be available on and we have a PlayStation 3 that it isn’t available on. While not an issue for me, because I have an Xbox One, we aren’t going to pay $6.99 a month if I’m the only one it’s available to.

   Those are the only issues I have so far, but I believe that Disney+ has potential."
2020-05-28 11:29:22,I love you but we have some issues,4,Truthful Ratings 01,False,"So one of the most frustrating issue I have with Disney plus has to do with iOS devices so if your not that keep on looking. So as I was saying one of my biggest issues with Disney plus is some wired glitch or something for example when I touch the screen of my device it shows me options like the pause button language settings and all that, so after I touch it once I try to pause it. But after I make that second touch to pause it, it immediately takes me out of what I was viewing and into what I would see if I exited that movie so the main menu or the title of what I was watching. And it tends to happen randomly."
2019-11-17 01:28:22,Overall great but can use some updates,3,Dankyung,False,"This app is great and it was so overwhelming trying to pick what I wanted to watch first. Couple of suggestions; if there could be a “play from beginning” button and also a “continue watching” section that would be insanely helpful. I have to keep going back to the home page and finding the movie I had left off from. Also, tried to start a movie from the beginning as my partner wanted to watch something I was in the middle of, I had to scrub all the way to the beginning which isn’t a huge deal but the convenience of a button to just start it would be so nice. The steaming overall is okay; more often then not it will randomly stop and buffer and also just completely stop."
2020-08-13 16:14:15,This app is awesome but one thing 🦋🌸,5,Socat321,False,"I really like this app! If you of you like Disney channel they have it here (and definitely if you don’t like watching the new shows) it has a lot of great shows that you can’t watch on tv anymore like that so raven, Lizzie McGuire, and many more! They also have diary of a wimpy kid on this app amazing! 

BUT I have one problem please add some more Disney Channel shows! When I go to find some I don’t see a lot of shows that are really old (like from the 90’s) please add some that I haven’t already heard of but other than that I really like this app!

2020-09-20 18:22:36,Plz read,4,Review Specialist🤪,False,"I really do enjoy Disney+. Me and my family bought it about a month ago. I personally am a hardcore Disney fan so I love this app. I think the price is just a little to high, but I mean it’s Disney so what do you expect? The overall condition of the app is kind of weird. I want the continue watching to be like Netflix, where when you get to the credits and get off of the movie, it doesn’t show in your continue watching anymore. I’m a very organized person so that kind of bothers me. The 10 second fast forward and rewind button is very glitchy. The volume on all of these shows and movies are really low. Thanks for reading my review and absolutely NO hate to Disney!!"
2019-11-17 06:44:10,"Love, Love, Love",5,Destiny Stark,False,"I love the Disney+ app. I love being able to not only have it on my phone but to also be able to have it on my ps4 and Xbox One. Also, I love that I can stream on 4 devices at one time and not have to pay a fortune for it. My wife and I and nephews and other family love sitting down and watching all the older Disney movies from our childhood and bringing back memories from our childhood. It’s like watching it for the first time again. I anticipated for awhile for Disney+ to come out and when it finally did I was totally excited.  I am excited to be able to continue watching all my favorite Disney shows and movies. Thank you Disney+"
2019-11-16 19:00:55,Hmm...?,3,Nolee19(:,False,I love the app very much it offers a great selection of movies and shows that I cannot stream anywhere else. However it desperately needs a continue watching or some way of picking up where you left off. I started watching a bunch of different shows not knowing I couldn’t easily go back to where I left off. Other streaming services have the tab for “continue watching” or other fast and easy ways for continuing the show. I hope that Disney already knows that they made a mistake with not offering this first thing but hopefully with all the reviews that they’re getting they listen. For now I suppose I will just have to remember every episode and time I stopped watching but hopefully this is resolved by the end of the day.
2019-11-14 04:10:11,AMAZING just needs something added,5,Kas0501,False,Honestly the best purchase I've made. Its kind of overwhelming on how many things there is to watch. And the amount of nostalgia is incredible I actually cried its like i can vividly remember my 8 year old self watching a lot of these cartoons in my room which was completely decorated with tinker bell things. The only thing i would wish they could add is a section of like continue watching like netflix has because every time i get out i have to go back and search the specific thing i was watching again i think it would just make it a lot easier but besides that this is literally amazing
2020-05-23 20:46:36,Read this review disney!!!,4,Katie0725!,False,"Okay guys, Disney plus is a great app and you should for sure download it! I am a 12 year old girl so you can trust that I know everything wrong with the app. None of the other disney apps have been this great. So good job disney! But I have also noticed that not all shows have been added to this wonder of an app!!!! So I kindly ask if you wonderful disney workers could pretty please add dog with a blog to your amazing wonderful app!!! Would you also add mighty med and ant farm! If you do I will be ever so happy!! You will never believe how much it is to watch dog with a blog on my tv. I would really so much like to be able to watch one of your best shows, Dog With a Blog. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE pretty please!!! 

Please?"
2020-05-18 12:17:56,Extremely Disappointing,1,Benwarcar,False,"To be clear, this review is for Disney+ as an app, not as a service. The content is great, but the app was not ready for launch in November and has made an astounding lack of progress in the months sent. Somehow, this app managed to get rolled out without a “continue watching” feature. You actually had to manually search for what you were watching and find your place each time. Even now, the app is TERRIBLE at remembering where you left off in a movie or show. I find myself continually watching the same three episodes of Mickey Mouse Clubhouse because no matter how many times you watch an episode or manually select a different one, Disney+ cannot seem to progress to new episodes. Having access to this content is a game changer for parents of young kids, but using the app feels like a chore each and every time."
2019-11-19 03:29:33,A Continue Watching Would Be Helpful For Us Disney Lovers,4,maddieschwy,False,"I love Disney+!  As a girl who grew up watching Hannah Montana, Wizards of Waverley Place, and both Suite Life series, it is awesome to relive my childhood and watch the shows I loved as a kid again.  One thing that would make the experience of this even better would be adding a continue watching or a currently viewing space where viewers can pick up exactly where they left off.  This is beneficial because the viewer would not have to search for or remember what episode they left off on.  I also hope that more Disney Junior shows are added, I loved watching those with my younger brother! Overall I am ecstatic about Disney+ and have been watching non stop!"
2020-04-13 23:37:33,It’s Great!!! “My List” needs a fix however and some shows are missing.,5,PhantomSlayer29,False,"I absolutely love all the content in this app, my favorite movies all in one place! The only problem I seem to be having is the problem with adding movies to a list. You’ll see movies you have just recently added to the list on the top menu, but the movies you’ve had added previously will be over lapsed by the films on the top and you won’t be able to see or access the movies you have previously added. There is also some missing shows that I thought would be added, but aren’t such as Ant-Farm, Pair of Kings, and Zeke & Luther."
2020-02-15 19:28:39,love the content hate the app,3,zombie_jesus,False,"The content on Disney + is outstanding. I’m enjoying it throughly. However, the iOS and AppleTV apps, though intuitive, are really buggy. 

The minimized video feature does t work well on the iPad. When you go back to full screen it takes you to the main dashboard and plays the video in the background. You have to close the app out to fix it. Also, when fast forwarding or rewinding you get a spinning wheel and lose the controls. Though the video does play. 

The AppleTV app controls are often laggy. The touchpad on the remote is sometimes slow and and it’s hard to browse the content. The app also freezes when switching between apps. I often find my self closing it and reopening."
2020-01-23 00:12:34,"Love the content, app needs work!",3,BronwynL,False,"The app has a LOT of problems.  The biggest (and most annoying) ones I’ve experienced are:
- the app not remembering which episode I’m on.  In the “continue watching” section it will show a completely random episode, and I have to actually do a search for the show, find the season I was on, and click on the episode I was actually watching.  Luckily the app DOES remember my place, and the episode always starts up right where I left off, It is just very annoying to have to go to the extra trouble. 
- on my iPad, I often will minimize the window so i can keep watching while I check my email, or whatnot.  however, when I go back to the app, the app totally reloads, rather than just maximizing the window again... annoying, but the REALLY bad part is that the audio continues.  When I try to relaunch the episode, it will start up (with audio) but the original audio just continues on, on top!

Things I would love to see:
I know I can click the plus next to shows I like, but it would be great if those shows or movies showed up at the very top of the app, so I can find them quickly!"
2019-12-08 20:41:44,Keeps freezing!,3,Foxymama86,False,"I want to give the app 5 stars because it has all my childhood favorites I digitally remastered format but I can’t sit through a single show yet alone a movie without it pausing or freezing on me, over and over 🙄 I bought a year subscription but now I feel like I wasted my money, if this keeps continuing I don’t think I would want to continue my subscription that long. My
iPhone has been updated, and I’m steaming it through an authorized apple brand hdmi adapter so there shouldn’t be any issues. None of my other apps glitch or
Freeze and I can enjoy a whole movie without having to start over the app multiple times. I
Hope Disney would fix this glitch in their next update, because we really love the content!"
2019-11-20 15:59:25,Love it,5,Oliv_moore,False,"Disney plus is everything that it promised it would be and I really enjoy looking back at all the nostalgic films and shows. On first impression it is very nice to look at and easy find things, however I think it would be helpful to add a “continue watching” section or something like that. Because if you’re in the middle of watching a show, you have to remember which episode you were on in order to go back to it and simply hitting “play” on the title screen of the show itself will take you back to the first episode. I would recommend adding that. Other than that everything looks really great!!"
2019-12-25 22:14:37,Getting Show Seasons on time/sooner,4,Hillaree Hankerson,False,"It is a great app. I have very little problems with it. We have been using it two weeks now and have had no complications. The only problem I have is that they don't have the shows updated right. An example is Marvel's The Runaway it is up to three seasons and it only has one on this app. I have been waiting for at least the second season to be added, but it hasn't and that is a little disappointing. We have to try to watch it on our Firestick just to watch it and our Firestick hasn't been working very well. I hope the company will keep it's shows up to date on the season, but rather than that it is a good app in all."
2019-11-18 18:43:06,DISNEY NOSTALGIA,5,SithLordBumi,False,"I won’t try to pretend as if I didn’t stay up late to check out the Disney+ Service. It was like a sensory overload of my childhood and even things I watched as I got older. 

My favorite part about the service is if your television supports 4K and HDR, there is so much content that streams in 4K. From the Star Wars movies to the MCU films and even some such as Hocus Pocus are all in 4K. The funny part was hocus Pocus being in 4K but not Tron Legacy. 

I agree with the complaint of there not being a “recently watched” tracker since there are multiple users allowed and so many season especially of The Simpson’s. I think it is a great service and can not wait to see what more Disney releases."
2019-11-15 04:47:27,A few things this service needs,3,kickassjack,False,"I’ve read a few other reviews and many mention the lack of a currently watching list. This is one of the reasons I am leaving a 3 star review. The primary reason I decided to review though is that there is no system for keeping track of where you are in a series. I have been using this app for watching the simpsons and it is getting annoying that when I push play it begins with the first episode of the series rather than the one I left off on. It knows exactly what minute and second of the episode I left on when I select that episode, but I shouldn’t have to select the specific episode. 
Honestly if every other streaming service has figured it out the mega corporation Disney can too!"

I’ve got to soft reset the app and then resume play, Sometimes I even have to find the spot I originally pause the app. 

Months later I decide to go to drive to a place with free WiFi  and I sit for about 2 hours trying to download movies because I Live out in a rural area and I don’t have any WiFi, and to lighten the load on my data usage. I wake the following day to watch my download and the don’t work! After a one month subscription I won’t be using Disney+ until these fixes are realized. Unlike you guys I need my $8! I could use them for something else."
2020-04-27 02:40:58,I LOVE IT,5,TheDisneyGirl🏀❤️,False,"Okay so you see I’m a major Disney fan. My whole family got a subscription shortly after it came out. Best app ever. I don’t care about minor bugs. It’s a little pricy but totally worth it. It has old Pixar shorts, and shows I’ve never even heard about. I love how you can also download stuff too to watch without WiFi. One thing. Can PLEASE add more profile pics of more movies and shows. I watch 101 Dalmatian street and as far as I’ve seen, there is no profile pic for that. Maybe even change them out every few weeks or something. But overall, I got to give it to you Disney, you did an AMAZING JOB with this app. Crushed it."

On our Xbox the watchlist also shows half but that half is showing twice. 

Also when watching movies with a lot of action scenes (Marvel/Star Wars) all of the talking is super quiet and then the tiniest explosion is super loud making me scramble to get my tv down to a reasonable volume before my neighbors come pounding at my door.

The last few day while watching a series an error message will appear between each episode not allowing them to continually play. Sometimes this even causes the app to crash all together. Especially on the Xbox."
2020-01-03 20:51:06,Amazing App,5,Gqpp,False,This app is amazing. I have been watching many shows and movies with my yearly subscription. There are many movies and apps to chose from. My personal favorites is the Star Wars genre. One glitch that I wish to be fixed soon is where you go back or ahead a few seconds. There is a loading circle that shows up when you go back or ahead but sometimes it stays there. Therefore I can’t pause or skip the show or movie again unless I leave the movie/show and re open it. This is the only complaint I have with this app. I am looking forward to see new movies and content in the future!
2019-12-30 07:03:26,"Great content, horrid app",2,a kinda different person,False,"Love the content of Disney plus, goes without saying. 
 
But the app is bad. When I leave the app and come back in, the show is still playing even though I am not watching it (I can see the library and still hear the show playing). The organization is okay, biggest issue is that I can’t easily resume my show, I either have to find the show and resume or scroll to find continue playing. Bigger problem is that sometimes when I go to resume if I didn’t finish watching the credits I have to resume that particular episode and watch the remaining credits (this happens maybe 30% of the time still annoying). The app is slow and buggy, it’s just not smooth to navigate. It  fully backs me out at least once every-time I use it. My last big thing is that the continue to next episode button disappears so easily. If I fast forward a touch (like the 10 sec skip) I lose it, and have to wait the extra 2 minutes to stare at credits to watch the next show. Similar complaint with the skip intro button but not nearly as big of an issue. 

New app, it’s buggy, hope they fix it quick.

The Mandalorian is a 10/10 tho so that’s awesome."
2019-12-30 00:02:23,Worth it but some glitches..,5,Commander bobby,False,"So, this app is worth it, I can say for sure, u get every Disney movie u can watch anytime if u download them, easy to download and easy to remove. NOW ONTO THE BUG REPORT.

So, I’ve tested this on 2 devices. One kinda old, and one atleast before 2019, but not that long down, maybe a few years, or 2. Anyway, so when I go to tap twice to go BACK I think 15,10 seconds. It gives me a inf loading thing on screen, the movie still goes, but the circle is on screen and annoying, I’ve found a temp fix for this though which is to then move it FORWARD the ten,15 seconds on screen. Thank you for reading."
2019-12-21 04:07:53,Love the app!,4,cheezywaffles19,False,"I have been using Disney plus for a little while now and I love the content! Though there are a couple of things. So I know that this is a new app and still needs a few tweaks here and there but this is the main problem; so after I press the fast forward or rewind buttons, it gives me the loading symbol. I think a few other people I know  have had this same problem, and I wasn’t sure if it was a bug at first. Also, I think you should add the show Austin and Ally to this app because many people were disappointed to find that the show had ended. Other than these few problems I had, this is one of the best apps I have ever seen! Great work!"
2019-11-22 01:39:28,"Great service, app needs improvements",4,hcomstock23,False,"I am so happy with all of the shows and movies offered with Disney+, and am even happier with the bundle subscription. However the app definitely has its share of issues. My first time using the app was great, but the next time I went to use it, I was told that Disney+ was not available at my location. I had to delete and re-download the app in order to get it to work because simply logging out and then back on did not work. Unfortunately I am dealing with this issue on multiple occasions. Once again, I love this streaming service and everything that comes with it, but I expect an update for the app to work out any bugs."
2019-11-22 22:12:57,Horrible customer service,1,Nigmaa,False,"Where to begin i’ve literally been on hold for 3hour and 52 minutes waiting for a representative. When i was told it would only be 10 minutes. Working for a call center i calmly waited. After the first 2 hours i tried to chat while waiting on hold. The chat said it would be less then 30 minutes( >30 ).. 41 minutes later the chats closed on me with no help and no resolution. 
Here I am typing coming up on 4 hours of waiting.. this is ridiculous. I don't feel like a valued customer any longer. So i’ll most likely be asking for a full refund for the full 1 year subscription i’ve just paid for. 
Wish Disney would do something about it but can’t seem to talk to anyone.. i’ll be contacting the BBB regarding this experience as well i think customers should be aware that this is the service we are subscribing too."
2019-11-15 13:09:12,Love!!!,4,jrdddn,False,"I absolutely love that all my Disney faves are on here! I’ve been wanting a way to watch all the old school shows and original movies, so I’m glad I have a way to do that now! However, there are a few features I do wish this app had. Such as, a “continue watching” list. It’s definitely a pain that I have to search for what I was watching. Not only that, but it seems to be making me re-start what I’ve already watched. Not to mention, attempting to fast forward is another huge pain. It will only go in 15 second intervals and if you do it too many times, it errors out and goes back to the main screen. Fix those few things, and you’ll have a top notch app!"
2019-11-19 21:31:43,My thought,5,Todoroki1025,False,"So this is an amazing app due to the fact that the have so many of the Disney movies that I can’t find on any other movie apps. The only thing that I don’t like is that they don’t have a lot of languages to listen in, they only have a few and that’s it, Need to have a wider selection of languages for those who don’t know that language, Disney movies and songs are the way I have been learning new languages and I would like it if they could have more than what they have, they need to also change the subtitles to be what it would transfer to in that language. Besides this I think that this is a great app."
2020-10-18 18:24:08,Languages,4,Tcandray,False,"I really love this app, it has so many beautiful movies, and new movies that I love, the problem is that most of the new movies are only in the Spanish language of Spain, I have no problems with Spain or their language , but this language has words and references that many of the  times I don't understand because I'm from Central America, so I prefer to see them in English, but I can't see them with my family because my mother and stepfather don't understand much English and they don't like Spanish from Spain because they don't understand some things either, I would like that you guys to put a little more importance to Latin Spanish as you do with the Spanish of Spain."
2019-11-12 10:17:54,Since I’m one of the first ones...,5,StarWarsTheCloneWarsSeason7!,False,So it’s a great service so far and I love it so far. Woke up at launch watched The mandalorian (Great first episode go watch it) and after that I went to the marvel section and they had ALOT of movies but not a lot of shows yet so if marvel is the thing you want this service for I would wait until more Shows come out but besides that they have endgame which I LOVE. In the Star Wars section it is mainly movies and like 6 different shows which is understandable because they haven’t made a lot of shows. Pixar section is great and ALOT of movies. Nation geographic is nice. Great service and can’t wait for Star Wars the clone wars season 7!
2020-04-29 17:13:53,Classic Disney,4,Mith4Dj,False,"Yes. Especially if you are into classic Disney. Their endgame is all about nostalgia vs. brand spanking new content. This is why we have to wait 6 - 8 month for new movies or tv shows to come to disney+. They’re still available to buy on digital/bluray. Think about it...if this was your company, wouldn’t you want to make some money on purchases than no money? However if you are no into Disney or care for their long history, nor marvel, pixar, nat geo or star wars then you won’t like it. We love Disney and I would honestly rate Disney+ 4 out of 5. The video streamer is not the best and the content is kind of low but this is still year 1. Let’s see how they improve over the years."
2020-07-06 17:15:15,Great App,5,Nekoooooooooooooo,False,"The app is quite easy to navigate and I enjoy how it has a wide selection of videos. I read some reviews where people have complained about issues with the app and I find it disappointing to see so many people who don’t use enough of their brain to realize that due to the extreme increase of people using video streaming apps, there will be complications on the loading time. It is sad to see so many reviews where people lash out and feel the need to unnecessarily share a problem where it is not completely the app’s fault itself instead of taking time to consider other factors."
2020-03-08 05:10:19,"Wonderful subscription , a few problems though",4,Liam .S,False,"I've had such a nice time using Disney+ watching all the marvel MCU movies and The Mandalorian series. it's a great subscription for a decent price , especially if you want to have a nice streaming subscription for the family to watch old cartoon classics or newer exclusive shows . 
I've come across a few glitches or things I've noticed that I kind of get a bit distracted from watching the show/movie . 

1. sound issues. I'm sure it's not my headphones or my phone, I've done plenty of tests . 
what would happen, is I would try to watch a show at a 8 out of 10 volume level as an example, then without notice or anything, the sound would drop to a 4 out of 10 level for a few minutes without me being able to fix it besides turning up my volume only to blow my eardrums out when the sound returns to the level I wanted it at. 

2. navigation through the app is very slugish, I've noticed a half second Delay from pressing play , pause, skip or rewind 15 seconds, and other actions while streaming"
2020-04-16 03:09:16,"More Holes Than Green Lake, Texas",3,hahahahaha NOPE,False,"Friends. Esteemed colleagues. I have been in my house for a month now. This is not your fault, I know. I understand. I appreciate your services during this trying time. The ability to watch Ice Princess and Go Figure back to back is not one I take for granted, I assure you. Yet the gaping, empty void I find in my life left by the absence of American Dragon: Jake Long is one that cannot be filled through even the greatest of mid-2000s figure skating movies. I just want to be lulled to contentment by the incomparable Dante Basco’s soothing voice. I just want to hear the Jonas Brothers explain that they are NOT braggin’, and he IS the American Dragon. It is at this point, and this point alone, that my life will be complete. Thank you for your time and consideration in this matter."
2020-04-14 07:45:15,Stolen Info,1,CDC-43,False,"My issue isn’t with the app, more with the company’s support team and policies. My account was stolen and email and password were changed. Obviously changed. The email was a random series of letters and numbers and based in India. I talked to a support member who could only tell me to notify my bank because they couldn’t see and fraudulent activity even though I sent both my sign-up confirmation email, which was sent to my correct email, and a screenshot of the new email, the person’s who stole my account in the app. This support member “passed my concerns along to people higher up” and told me to wait up to a week. I attempted to give other ways to show it was in fact a stolen account situation but this member repeatedly told me it appeared as if I was trying to steal someone’s account. So be careful with your accounts and dealing with their “help” team."
2020-03-27 00:21:25,Beautiful but...,5,yuna💕,False,"This streaming app is really good and it lets me take a break into the Disney world and watch my favorite classics, however; there are some movies that are gonna take a long time to stream even tho they showed up a long time ago, like for example: Cinderella, Ralf breaks the internet (Netflix started streaming it already), Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker and Sleeping Beauty, which are not movies that recently came out last month,  But that’s only a little issue that I have. I really like Disney+ and how it’s all organized in different categories, it’s a really good place to spend time with family and have a good laugh. Thank you."
2019-12-03 23:55:35,Totally worth it!,4,gillak88,False,So I waited a little while before signing up because I had heard of the glitches. Those are to be expected with a new app for sure. I am super pleased that this has come out. The only issues I’ve had so far are connecting to my chromecast; it just keeps buffering so for now I’ll just watch it on my iPad. The second issue is that my favorites list seems to be out of whack; when I look through my list some movies are listed in my list multiple times which is odd and there are a lot of movies that are not showing up in my last even though I’ve saved them. Other than those issues this app is definitely worth every penny!
2020-01-11 13:08:20,Doesn’t allow you to cancel!,1,Mattbatt117,False,"Disney+ doesn’t specify that if you leave the US, you no longer have access to any more content than what you download, and to make matters worse, Disney+’s website doesn’t even have SERVICE outside the US, so you can’t log in to cancel a subscription that you can’t even use!! I took a one month vacation to Mexico and once I stepped off the plane and turned airplane mode off, Disney+ said “service unavailable check internet connection” I’ve yet to arrive at the US to at least try to get my money back for the current cycle which I can’t use. Since official websites are down the only other option (since VPN doesn’t even cut it) is to give someone else in the US my account credentials to log in and cancel it for me which is definitely not an option a company like this should make you take."
2019-12-30 00:20:52,Great app! Does not have all Disney movies though,5,Kennathewinna,False,"I absolutely love Disney+ and use it almost everyday. Therefore, I have watched a large portion of the shows and movies already. I would like it if their were a few more movies and shows to greaten the variety of content on Disney+. The app however is very organized and has many old shows that you don’t find anymore like Hannah Montana and Good Luck Charlie both of which Netflix recently discontinued. The only thing is the app runs slow on occasion causing the movie/show to buffer. I would love for these minor changes to be made, but other than that this is a fantastic app!"
2019-11-30 00:52:56,So far mostly great,4,ahuberhomes,False,Good selection to watch from. No issues with streaming. They added a “continue watching” section to fix that problem. A few bugs to work out that resulted in 4 instead of 5 stars: 1.  The sound on most movies the music is way louder than the voices. We have to turn our tv sound up to 70 on the Star Wars movies to hear them talk. We don’t have this issue on other apps. 2. When searching if you select a movie to review then return you’ll be directed back to the top of the movie list on the main page instead of the last location you were searching in. Hope they keep adding new content to make keeping it worth it.
2019-11-26 04:37:11,Needs a little work,4,2319user2319,False,"There’s a couple issues. Sometimes when I rewind my tv just put the subtitles on for no reason then there’s nowhere on the screen (or the app as far as I can tell) to take them off or to change the language. Further with this issue I tried to watch a movie that was in Spanish (that I know was originally in English) the description did not say it was in Spanish nor could I change it back to English. I do like that they added a continue watching tab however, it doesn’t get rid of movies or shows I finished watching. Overall this is a great app considering the vast Disney content , but it needs improvement with the organization."
2019-11-14 20:45:05,Awesome but could use improvements!,4,MadisonHereWithTheTruth,False,"Okay first off I am loving all of these movies and shows! There are a few that aren’t on that I wish were (American Dragon, Proud Family, etc.) but that’s okay. Maybe you can add them at a future date!

A few things I see for room of improvement would be adding a currently watching section, an easier way to continue watching the episode instead of having to search for the episode I remember I’m on. One last thing is the captions. If we can get it to stick instead of having to click on it every time a new episode comes on that would be great!

So yeah I love this so far but there could definitely be some improvements!"
2019-11-21 13:09:30,Great but needs some tweaks,2,JAshFit,False,I love being able to watch all my favorites on one app! However there is no keep watching area and I a never remember what I was watching. I always have to try and figure out what movie or show I was on to manually search for it. Also while watching a show it does not automatically go to the next episode? I hook up my phone to my tv and for 27 min episodes it’s a pain to hit the next episode button when your busy lol makes me not want to watch. For shows like the mandalorian release all at once because some of us like to binge watch. Holding onto the episodes and making us wait is torture lol it’s one of the reasons I don’t watch a lot of regular tv anymore and just wait for the series to be available online. I can watch at my leisure whenever I’d like.

So happy the classics are on here, shows, news ones and old. I showed my 3 year old daughter and 10 month old son Pinocchio and they both loved it! They were both watching it and my daughter wanted me to replay it after it was done. I hope no shows or movies get removed as I been wanting to show my kids the movies I grew up with but I couldn’t find ! All my VHS movies messed up from sitting there so long, I’m glad I can now access them at a tap of a finger 🙂🙂🙂 this really is a plus in our life:)"

2019-11-14 03:23:51,Somewhat disappointed,3,allsmiths,False,"I was very excited about this service and decided to take advantage of the 7 day free trial. First off, I will say, there is a lot to choose from for Disney fans. Everything from Star Wars to Cinderella. The selection of content is pretty good. I would have liked to see EVERY Disney feature film (such as “Moon Spinners”, the Haley Mills classic, “Toby Tyler”, “The Castaways”, “So Dear to My Heart” etc..., and I hope they will be added soon. The interface is somewhat primitive for today’s streaming preferences. The app keeps freezing up, no matter what device I’m using. I would love to have the ability to create a playlist, where I can add videos to play consecutively. That would be awesome, as none of the other streaming video services offer that feature."
2019-11-12 16:18:20,DUMPSTER FIRE,1,DankHime,False,"I was pretty excited for this under the expectation that I’d be able to watch movies from my childhood that I’ve been dying to re-watch buuuuut that quickly flew out the window.. and so did my subscription before ever getting charged. So thankful for that free trial.

First of all, as mentioned above where is everything?! I know, I know. It’s new and all that but we’re talking about Disney here. There’s literally no reason why they can’t host a decent library of their content without issue. There’s really just not much selection at all unless you’re into every bad very of Star Wars they’ve released. I was really hoping for some nostalgia to come through with this app and I’m sure I’m not alone in that.

Secondly, what’s with this garbage UI?! Again, we’re talking Disney here and what they’ve made is pretty much a try hard Netflix rip-off. Only it’s slower, buggier and a pain to look at. Nothing loads, nothing works and what does work is the junk series they constantly crap out to push towards pre-teens and whatever imaginary view of teenagers and high school gimmick garbage they’ve been doing over and over again. Sounds great, right?

Third.. I don’t have a third opinion. It’s just all bad. Keep your money, this crap show won’t last long anyway."
2020-06-07 19:01:22,I love it but I have some concerns,4,zoopopjkhorse,False,"I love Disney+ I think it is a great app and I love watching my favorite Disney shows but sadly they are not all on here it new episodes and seasons aren’t posted right away. I’ve noticed that they seem to add some of our favorites back slowly but I was disappointed when it took them so long to release I didn’t do it, I still love the app though and even if it takes more time I’m willing to wait,I just hope it doesn’t. I would like to see these things fixed again even if it takes time I am willing to wait, as frustrating as it can be I still enjoy watching what I can. Again a great app I love it and watch it all the time!"
2019-11-18 21:54:20,Pros and Cons,4,Skyluke23,False,"The app functions well, some connection playback issues at first. These have improved I’m assuming a bit of surge on the server on release. 
Great content, Disney worked to bring in even the outlier shows that played for a season. Some content I didn’t even realize was Disney.
Con: no currently watching. 
I need to be able to easily find a show/movie I’ve been watching. It reduces user friendliness to have to remember what episode I was on and find it. 
CON: keeping track of episodes
On my phone I notice when I got back to a series it starts at episode one. It remembers where I was on the episode but does not go to the most recent episode watched. 
Overall I enjoy the app. I’m still on the free trial, and I will probably keep it. Enough content to keep my interested, and more to be added. 
Side note: how will I know when a new episode is being released of the mandalorian?

I had to put on captions the other day and I realize your captions are off at times. This is a big issue for deaf/hard of hearing persons. This was noticed on the mighty ducks animated series."
2020-04-24 16:08:26,For now,3,TribeOfBenjamin12,False,"So I just dwnld’d n subscribed to this. I haven’t yet watched anything so that’s why only 3 stars ⭐️. When I see how things go I’ll either rate more or less. But what I’m seeing is shows from my youth that I haven’t seen in years! I found they have The Gummi Bears! I’ve been asking ppl my age if they remember that show n they rarely do. So to find that was already a treasure! I’ve also found other shows from my youth n I’m excited to begin watching. I’ve even found an old animated movie that is hard to find unless I order it online. Plus, I have Chromecast n can cast to my TV!!! I’m excited 😆. I’m hoping any bugs or issues that ppl have complained about have been fixed. I look forward to my first experience with Disney+. ☺️😊😍🥰😁😀"
2019-11-25 22:53:08,Stop logging me off and making me reset my password,3,Han Solo Dolo,False,"Quite frustrated and disappointed in the Disney plus app. Nothing like how easy Netflix is to use(I understand it’s not the same). They keep logging me out and making me reset my password. I can’t count how many times at this point. I get they want to prevent sharing but this is beyond rediculous. I can’t use the app on my phone then pause and go to my tv without having to reset everything(I’m not even sharing!!). Disney you are very frustrating to use. Pretty disappointed. I was expecting Disney to be on it. Especially for how much work they’ve probably put into this.

Other than that great for being able to access all of the awesome and timeless Disney content."

At first I thought this wouldn’t be exciting, but after I had sooo much fun watching movies and other stuff that I will agree to give this app 5 stars. Another detail that surprised me is that when you look up a movie like Cinderella and your trying to find the new one it tells you when it’s so going  to be in the app so I don’t have to go and search it up. 
😁😁😁This is the app I was looking for"
2019-11-22 17:23:44,Best Birthday Present Ever!!!!,4,acrawford0429,False,"I love that you have SO many of the movies and tv shows I grew up watching. My husband got the app for me for my birthday and we have been watching it ever since. I love that you have the classic shorts: Goofy, Pluto, and Donald, as well as Mickey. The harder to find movies like The Ugly Daschund and Willow were a surprise. The reason I am giving 4/5 stars is because I have to go hunting for what we were watching the night before. My kids go to bed at 8 pm and we don’t always finish what we were watching the night before. The next night I have to hunt down the movie we were watching. Please add a continue watching feature. I have the app on Roku and on my iPhone if that helps."
2020-05-26 14:17:55,It’s a coin toss...,3,OGwheels,False,"We are a huge Disney family. We go every year — most times twice a year!! We love all the movies the app has, especially when it’s time to put our 7mo to sleep. Now, for the issue I only gave 3 stars... The odds of the app actually working is like flipping a coin. Sometimes the app works and streams flawlessly. Other times we goto watch a movie and it doesn’t work. We get some “sorry the app is down” type of message. Half the times we want to watch something we end up having to buy or rent it on Apple TV because the app isn’t working. Long story short, the app still gets 3 stars because at very least, our personal movie download collection is growing because the app only works half the time"
2019-12-24 03:05:07,"Incredible app, some suggestions though",5,Benson The Beast,False,"I love Disney+! I love how you can download movies and shows and watch them offline, it is really entertaining and I have been binge watching Marvel, Star Wars etc. for the past month and i can’t stop! There are some things that could be changed for the better. Please make it a feature that you can delete movies or shows that show up as “continue watching.” This bugs me so much! It would also be great if Disney+ members could get sneak peaks at new movies, this could be controversial but I think it would be awesome. Thank you Disney, and keep doing whatever you’re doing!"
2019-11-13 14:01:15,Great Content but needs some tweaks,4,Keymaster1980,False,"When Disney Plus was announced I was ecstatic. Finally a singular place to watch all the stories about loved and a place to create new stories. The content is amazing and over time with the addition of new and more of the original content this will be the king of streaming. But I wish when I add things to my watchlist it would have the option to sort it between movies and shows and also alphabetically so there was some kind of order to my lists. Also when I add something to my watchlist, why doesn’t it mark that when I see the item again so I don’t just keep accidentally adding the same stuff overs and over again."
2019-11-19 01:55:12,my reason for one star please read and improve,1,Djmixerz,False,"look honestly Disney plus was something we all wanted and needed it really brings us back to our roots and really helps us remember the past and gives us memories that really warm the heart. however what i just found out something that really made nun of that matter and it was the fact that is not a single episode of special agent oso on the app, it was really heart breaking and almost made me hate the app to be honest i don’t even know how to think of the app any more i see no reason it shouldn’t be on there it was a really great show. the fact that it was (key word) “disney” jr doesn’t mean it shouldn’t be on there because it’s from disney and it makes no sense for it to not be on there since it is a “ Disney” show no matter the jr, xd, etc so this is why i’m giving this app a one star for this very reason."
2019-11-18 17:18:49,Misinformed,1,jeasica maritza flores roman,False,When I looked up Disney plus I was only offered the most expensive package with no free trial so I had no other option but to pay for it later on realized I would be paying for extra items I was never going to use so I tried to unsubscribe from Disney plus but couldn’t find the button to unsubscribe so I therefore went to the help page and was told there is a button in the billing address on the bottom right corner to cancel but there wasn’t one so I thought maybe I just missed it so I refresh and look everywhere for where the unsubscribe button was could be but no luck. I later called for help to see if someone from the company could fix the problem I was told I would only stay on the phone for a time span a little longer than 10 min I did not expect to stay on the phone for an hour and 25 min.
2019-11-17 00:38:04,Amazing but not perfect,5,Jacob3488421,False,I’ve been using this app a lot recently but I think it’s embarrassing that Disney doesn’t have a continue watching section. So many times of watched a few episodes of a show but then had to search it again just to keep on watching. I don’t understand why Disney doesn’t have this since every other streaming service of used has had it. One other thing I don’t like is that I don’t understand why Disney doesn’t have Austin and ally or dog with a blog. Since Disney owns these I don’t understand why they don’t just add them on Disney plus since a lot of people watched these shows as a kid.
2019-11-13 14:35:23,It’s a Disney Dream Come True!! 😍,5,Baylee8518,False,"No problems at all with the app so far. The only issue did not affect me, I made an account for my friend and it didn’t load on the screen right away. But after about 10 minutes she could get into her account.

I love scrolling through all the options and having flashbacks from my childhood. I couldn’t watch all the tv shows that I wanted to when I was little because there was so much Disney playing at the same time. But!! With is new app, it is truly a Disney dream come true!!! I didn’t know what to watch first! But I am so so so looking foreword to rewatching all the amazing Disney movies and tv shows that were in my childhood. 

I just hope that I will be able to control myself and not overdose on Disney. I need to get homework done at some time, college is hard😂. However, I know I can find relief from my work stress with the amazing stories made by Disney, Pixar, Marvel, and all of them! 
Thank you Disney for letting so many people watch shows that they love again! ❤️❤️"
2019-11-12 23:12:31,Excellent Originals And More,5,hemroid contractor,False,"The originals aren’t lazy and it shows they put plenty of effort to make them very good. The Lady and the Tramp Live action remake is beautiful and Ive been Binge watching the other originals like Noelle and Encore. I’ve also heard Great things about The Mandalorian. And There will be MANY more Original series and Movies to come like the Marvel shows that were announced a while back. It also has pretty much every Disney, Pixar, Marvel and Star Wars Movie. As of November 12th 2019 the Marvel Movies that are missing are the Spiderman Movies, Antman and the wasp, Thor Ragnarok or Black Panther. If You like Disney Movies, and Some other shows, Then you’ll absolutely love Disney Plus! Recommend 99%!"
2019-11-13 13:39:44,No way to track progress,3,Kheiron2711,False,"I love the content and the layout is familiar and easy to navigate but there needs to be a section showing what you're currently watching (instead of having to actively search for it again).
Far more importantly, there needs to be a way to tell which episodes you've already watched. Right now it doesn't indicate if you've seen an episode or not. You need to manually remember where you were. 
It doesn't even track if you've added a show to your watchlist. After you click the + it turns into a check mark but if you leave and re-enter, it's a + again. 
These are important features for a streaming service so I can't give more than 3 stars until they're added."
2019-11-12 13:10:22,Bugs,5,Its_CarolinexX,False,"I was so excited when I downloaded this app, and when I got on everything was just perfect!  The selection of everything Disney was so amazing!  There were just some bugs that need fixed.  Like, when you made profiles, it just switched them around and sometimes said it can’t connect for no reason.  Also, it takes a while to add something to your stuff/list, so you have to keep clicking until it finally works, and you have to exit out a couple times for the play button to appear.  Otherwise, this app is perfect and you shouldn’t change a thing!"
2020-09-18 07:38:26,Disney+ I enjoy this app!,5,pillowfight123,False,I love this app so much and I enjoyed watching my favorite Disney movies from touch of my iPad and the remote of my TV it is very enjoyable for all ages and I’m gonna give you my honest opinion the app is still prettying new but there are some Disney movies that will come later in the future so all of us Disney fans don’t have to worry and I also enjoyed the Disney show I personally love these shows and I’m excited to see what Disney+ has it for the future and I also wanted to say thank you to the creators because we wouldn’t have a large Disney vault of Disney movies to watch freely without them :3
2020-09-05 03:31:56,Disney,5,nF3416,False,"I do like Disney plus they have the shows that you can watch even though you don’t have it on your tv channel. They have all your favorite shows on Disney channel that you can unlimited without any trouble all you have to do is to buy it. And you have your favorite Disney shows that you can watch more and more. Like the Pixar movies that you haven’t seen in awhile like Toy Story, Monster Inc and others shows that you can watch as well. Check it out and get the app. They do have all the Disney hits like. Mulan, Halloweentown, The Mighty Ducks, lab rats and new ones as well called the Mighty Ducks from the 90’s."

Well when your listening to an episode of something and it ends I have to get woken up and turn on another one😬 please fix this guys! If there was a sixteenth of a star I would totally do it because I love this app sooo much other that that little thing and there is another thing but I want say it not to sound offensive I’m sorry if this is upsetting to here please don’t take this the wrong way guys I really love what you’ve done!!!😁😁😁 please respond soon!!!!! 😁😁fingers 🤞🏼"
2019-12-21 14:45:00,Enjoyable but data hog,1,TLN Productions,False,"My daughter and wife and I are all really enjoying the service and wide library. Smooth operation for the most part, but sometimes the layout is counterintuitive.  Also I just got a data warning from my ISP- which the only thing that changed was using Disney plus. We went from using 200gb a month to being on track to use nearly 1000gb... and we don’t use the service non stop. This is going to cost us overage fees which defeats the purpose of “cutting the cord”. I go into settings and there basically are none to adjust. You can’t choose the quality. 720p is plenty. 1080 at most and save 4K for special occasions. But no- it defaults to 4K nearly the entire time. Until users get the option to adjust data and quality (something all other services offer) 3 stars is a generous rating. May have to cancel."
2019-12-11 07:48:09,Love this app,4,random_person<3 :),False,Love this app I like how it has all the old original movies I also like how any age group can watch and it still be good. I just wish it had more of the remakes and  they don’t really update the page when you get on the the app which I wish they did so you can see more movie and show suggestions. I also wish that they didn’t schedule the new movies to get added on in 2 years or in a year. They did a really good job making the app itself I just wish they put more movies on sooner and put a page of all the movies being added from closest to furthest away. The app is good for all age groups and is enjoyably for the whole family.
2019-12-11 05:00:13,Glitches too much!,4,elli0605,False,"I created an account a week after Disney plus was launched. I was satisfied because Disney brought back my childhood! So many great movies and shows that I couldn’t find anywhere else! The only thing that disappoint me is, it glitched too much! It’s new so I’ll give it a pass. I thought many people are probably using it and maybe they will fix it in no time! However weeks passed by, it was still glitching! I thought my internet was causing it, but I asked couple of my colleagues if they are experiencing the same issue as I am and they said “Yes”. Therefore, I hope Disney will fix this issue as soon as possible because it is irritating!"
2019-11-17 17:30:18,One important update!!,4,AllysonJ3,False,"I love everything about Disney+ except one thing....there’s no ability to “start from the beginning” once starting an episode/show. Like many other toddlers and children, my child enjoys watching the same shows/episodes over and over again and it’s incredibly frustrating when we go to rewatch an episode and it starts at the end credits. This should have been a very obvious feature to include but for some reason, it’s been forgotten. I’m very shocked by that considering i know Disney thinks of everything. Usually. PLEASE fix this for a near future update!! Thousands and thousands of parents would greatly appreciate it I’m sure!!"
2019-11-24 06:54:33,Love it a lot but..,4,JacT10,False,"I absolutely love having all the tv shows and movies I used to watch and all the things my nieces/nephew watch now, right there for us to watch. It’s a fantastic app overall, I just have a few things I’d like to just throw out there. I wish I didn’t have to search for the show I was watching every time i go to watch it, I wish there was a “recently watched” section that would take me to all the shows or movies that I was watching. Also I’ve noticed on my PS4 and my phone the actual app lags a LOT when I’m watching anything. Overall I love the app, and my nieces/nephews love it as well! I’m excited about all the new and old movies I’ll be able to watch!"
2019-11-13 01:56:17,"Love the content, but...",3,thecrumblr,False,"Look I love how much content there is on here. I’m definitely pleased with everything available to watch. However some small ticks, when watching on my phone every time a new episode starts I have to remove the subtitles. I do like that there is an app for the Fire-stick, I also like that it works with Chromecast. I do wish that there was a keep watching section so that when I come back to continue a show I don’t have to track down the show and then remember which episode I left off on. A small thing like keep watching makes a huge difference. I didn’t experience any issues with crashes or unable to stream content. Even if I had it would not effect my review as it is launch day."
2020-09-14 17:57:23,Needs changes,2,hdksjchkdjsnsbdbs,False,Disney+ was pretty good. What must be changed is the idea that you should charge us monthly and then charge EXTRA to pay for a movie that should be free. We’re already paying $6.99 a month. Why should we have to pay an extra $30 to watch one movie? Maybe make the people who don’t have Disney+ pay the $30 to buy it- but why charge so much to people who are already paying for the subscription? I disapprove completely. The app is okay otherwise. No bugs or anything. But I do not like that you’re trying to get us to pay for a movie when we already pay monthly for Disney+. Also- why are some Disney shows/movies just not on Disney+? Why is it not connected with Xfinity? I have a smart TV but it’s not brand new so I can’t get Disney+ on the TV.
2020-05-10 06:06:56,Missing movies,5,noodleheadgurl,False,"Dear, Disney 

I love the app it’s incredible! It has all of my childhood movies and everything!However, I can’t seem to find some movies that are Disney movies, such as, Home alone 1 & 2(you use to have them), and Enchanted, that’s really all of the movies I can think of for now but there’s probably more. I just really thought Disney+ would have EVERY Disney movie on there. I would really love for the Home alone movies with Macaulay Culkin in them to come back. I got a little mad to see how you still have the third one there. Please make sure you put every  missing Disney movie back pretty please? Thanks😭"
2020-04-15 12:18:40,Screw Netflix! This is good!,5,Wallywest24,False,"Me and my mom, dad, little sister, and my little brother love Disney + and Disney in general! Netflix is maybe the same price and has been around longer, but the Disney company has been longer than Netflix ever has! Even though they took most of the movies off of Netflix, they took the movies that weren’t even ON Netflix! Compared to this Netflix is humiliated! Screw Netflix! Disney rose from the grave! Until Disney + came out Netflix was 90 % more famous than disney! Then Disney came up with Disney +! And Disney sorcerers arena! Even my mom loves it! Keep making good Disney games before Netflix boosts back to the top! I ❤️Disney!"
2020-03-31 01:40:09,Why can’t I screen share from my computer?,3,whsbflfirhdbskabbd,False,"I have have an Apple phone, laptop and an Apple TV. When we want to watch a movie as a family (I have two young daughters) I would like to play the movie on my computer and screen share to the Apple TV. But it won’t allow me to do it. It just does that error screen of oops something went wrong. But if I do the same thing from my phone it works. So I have to play the movie on my phone. It’s annoying. My phone is high jacked for 2 hours because we need to watch the show on a bigger screen. Normally things run smoothly from my phone, it does take it a while to load but once it starts playing generally we can finish the movie without any issues."
2020-01-03 10:57:29,Can’t use in other countries!?,2,Googleint,False,"The fact that I’m traveling and can’t use Disney+ is ridiculous. “It’s not available in my area”?! That shouldn’t matter if it’s an app I downloaded where it was available. Plenty of other apps offer support overseas even if they are not native to that country. Ex. Tiktok isn’t an app here. It doesn’t exist. But I can still access it and browse its content as though I was in the states. The fact that I can’t access DISNEY+ is baffling. It’s Disney. You own half the world. I will most likely not be paying for it in the future. Luckily this was only my trial but what a waste. Glad I watched all of “Mando” before I left and on the plane. Also, I was able to access the app half way through an international flight tens of thousands of feet above the ocean. So what’s good Disney?"
2020-01-02 00:04:53,I don’t know if you could even try to make a more broken app,1,124955548,False,"About every 30 seconds of streaming either 
1. The same 3 seconds of audio repeats over and over while video continues like normal
2. All visuals cut out while audio continues like normal 
3. All audio cuts out while visuals continue like normal or
4. The pause/ play button entirely disappears 

Anytime you switch away from the app (even just to type a quick text reply) once you return to the app it takes another minute to reload content, and then often breaks again.
That said, the best way I’ve found to fix this the problems it is continually having is to close the app, since it evidently can’t retain watch data at all. 
On top of all this, the layout of the app is just very counter intuitive and makes it very difficult to find anything without knowing the name of the film. Essentially, the app is useless. 
I appreciate the idea of having all of this content in one place, but it is inexplicably frustrating to try and use this counterintuitive, buggy interface. 
It’s amazing that a company as big as Disney can’t even make a properly functioning app, and these issues haven’t been addressed with near the urgency they deserve."
2019-12-29 06:21:28,Love it but hate it,2,Dont @ me on it,False,"I enjoy some of the app. I get to watch some of the classics and movies from my childhood but it would be nice if the watchlist yknow... worked? The list literally tripled itself over and over and the other half of the movies or shows are completely gone. AND I have to press the “+” icon 3 times to make sure that it’s ACTUALLY added to my watchlist. I’m pretty sure the point of downloading the movies/ shows is so that we don’t have to use WiFi to watch them yet so need WiFi. Idk if it’s just me but I have this issue. Also, I find it strange that some famous trilogy’s like for instance, Narnia, is missing the last movie like it was never made. Come on! I find it funny how y’all make so much money but create an app with so many flaws! Y’all can do better than this. Not happy :("
2019-11-22 05:20:33,It’s great but I have issues,4,TheQueenofMakeup,False,"First things first, I wish there was a continue watching section, because I’ll watch a couple things at once and not remember where I left off or the episode title. So it’s frustrating to scroll through everything to find what I was watching. 

Second thing, a couple of the old Disney Channel shows, their episodes are out of order and it’s frustrating for me to use google to be able to watch them in order. 

Third thing, maybe it’ll come with time, but there are a lot of shows missing and I can’t find when they’ll be released at all, I know there is 600+ items, but as someone who loved the late night shows (Brandy and Mr. Whiskers, Dave the Barbarian, etc) and even some shows that only lasted a little bit (Sonny with a Chance, Rolie Polie Olie, etc), I’m kind of upset those aren’t on there. But I hope with time they will be added on. 

And lastly, this is an amazing app, it’s like my childhood wrapped up in one thing and I love it. And bingeing shows makes it even better. Plus you can’t beat $6.99 a month."
2019-11-15 04:32:21,One major issue,4,GhostofFallenAngel,False,"I completely love how much is on here, especially knowing there’s so much more to come. The biggest thing we need is some sort of continue watching tab, or at least if i pull up the show it should show me where i left off so that i don't have to scroll around attempting to find where i left off. The only other thing I’ve noticed is that when i get a phone call and pause my show it times out within about 5 seconds and completely times out of the show and then i have to re-locate which show i was on because it timed out and went back to the home screen during my less than 5 minute phone call."
2020-06-08 23:17:16,"Good app and good content, ONE BIG PROBLEM",4,awesomedeadguy88,False,"Disney+ is mostly a good app. I love Star Wars. The main reason I downloaded this app, was to watch Star Wars content like The Clone Wars and The Mandalorian. Which are great by the way. The app also has a lot of other good content. 

The BIG PROBLEM that I have with this app, is the crashing. The app crashes when I’m downloading things, specifically The Simpsons and sometimes other things. When it crashes it kicks me out of the app and I can’t get back in unless I delete the app. When I re-download the app, I have to download all the stuff again. This has happened to me more than 10 times. PLEASE FIX THIS ISSUE! I AM CONSIDERING DELETING MY SUBSCRIPTION. THIS NEEDS TO BE FIXED!

One minor issue I have: The app is missing too many of the Marvel movies and shows. You’re also missing Solo: A Star Wars Story. Come on, it was made two whole years ago!!! Please get some more content!

Thank you for taking the time to read my review, I hope you guys will fix some of these issues! Thank you for making this mostly good app. 

Goodbye,
John"
2019-11-14 02:25:06,Amazing BUT FIX THIS!,5,Furfur004,False,"So I downloaded this immediately as it can available to watch. This is an amazing app, I don’t care what others are saying about this. People over here giving poor ratings because they don’t see all the things they want. I found plenty of old movies I wanted to watch just by searching it on your search menu. 

Who cares about your haters. Only a non true Disney fan would complain about petty things. Your app is nicely made. Thank you for making such awesome subscriptions. 

Please do look into this tho!!
Please create a recent list so I can go back and CONTINUE the recent movie I was watching. 
If your customer has kids and they find the remote and stops the movie or even if your customer fell asleep while binge watching Disney movies and misses the movie and wants to either continue or restart it. Those options should definitely be there on the main screen first thing that pops up, to be easily accessible.

That’s about it. 
Thanks again for a great app!"
2020-02-29 05:39:51,More movies,4,hjdbshfn,False,Ok so I love the app and everything but when I click on a certain movie I can’t watch it because it’s not on there yet. so I wanted to see if you could put them on there any quicker. Also when I want to watch a movie it’s on there but the next day it disappeared I know it sounds crazy but it’s true. I was on the middle of watching the movie and the next day it was gone. I searched it up on the internet and it said that it was on Disney+ but it’s not. It said that the movie wasn’t available and if had anymore problems with it I could contact Disney+ description error(41) but I have know idea what that is. The movie is called The Haunted Mansion.
2020-02-08 13:18:28,The app still has some issues,4,Andrick015794,False,"The has been a really great at this point seeing Disney movies is just really fun to watch with the family, but when half of your family is Hispanic and want to see the stunning video quality while air playing it on your tv, well it doesn’t happen when your changing languages in the app while streaming in your tv every time when it’s in English it’s streams with no problem to 4K but when I change it to Spanish (latinoamerican) the video quality lowers down to a 480p or lower which is really annoying and we can’t enjoy the movie because it’s in a really bad quality when changing languages"
2019-11-20 00:03:33,Great app! But....,4,Champagne.Joshi,False,"Biggest thing I find myself wanting from this app is a “currently watching” list. Don’t really understand why it was omitted but something we NEED in the next update. I am loving seeing all these Disney channel originals and surprised we got so many on launch, but a week after it’s release the glassy eyed daze has faded and I find myself walking down memory lane remembering a movie I loved as a kid only to find it isn’t available. I’m sure the list of movies/shows will get wider as the app matures but something to think about Disney!! You’ve swallowed up a ton of corporations and you don’t have Indiana Jones, maleficent, or sky high available for stream? Key staples if you ask me"
2019-11-21 11:38:21,Could use some helpful additions,3,ajjohnson77,False,"The content is great! However, the app does not allow for you to “play from the beginning” once you have started watching a show or movie. Little kids watch everything over and over wether they finished it the first time or not. I’m tired of clicking the back button over and over to start from the beginning. Also, within the episodes of a show, there is no way to determine which episodes you have already watched. I click on what I think is the next episode only to realize we’ve seen it. So we click the next and the next. Could use some helpful updates. All the streaming services that I have used offer these features."
2020-04-12 18:10:51,Suggestions/minor issues,4,kimmiebearr06,False,"1. The television episodes are not in the correct order i.e. on Phil of the Future, the very first episode is listed as #10.

2. On having the option to skip the intro theme, it continues at the middle of the intro... maybe change it to let it pick up at the last line of the theme song or right before the episode starts.

3. I was watching a movie called Camp Nowhere and I watch with captions. But on this movie, the captions were at the top of the screen the entire time until I turned them off 10 minutes into the movie (not sure if you guys could fix this problem - if you can, that would be great.)"
2019-11-17 17:50:17,Seems deliberately impossible to cancel 7 day trial,1,awardsAW,False,Started my trial. Created an account. Received email confirmation of account creation. Tried to login to account to cancel trial. Couldn’t log in. Said credentials were not correct. Reset password. Received confirmation email to email address that account is based upon. Said reset was successful. Tried to login again. Said there was no account. Called customer support on app - wrong number and didn’t work. Searched online for customer service contact number. That worked. Said wait time would be 10 minutes. On hold for a rep for 45 minutes. No one ever picked up. Appears Disney wants to create success by getting trials started with no way to cancel. Guess I will have to use my payment provider to cancel trial. Magical kingdom creating “magical” success in streaming by forced trial conversions.
2019-11-14 23:12:46,Continue Watching...,5,LucyCaitlin22,False,"My only complaint is that there is no ‘continue watching’ section and that shows don’t pick up where you left off. For example, I was watching That’s So Raven and stopped in the middle of episode 3 yesterday. I went and searched for the show a today (since there is no continue watching section) and clicked play... literally started at episode 1 again. This is going to make this really annoying for those of us who can’t remember what episode we left off on...

Other than that, the selection is amazing and I’m really happy with what this had to offer!"
2020-10-06 02:57:01,What’s not to like???,5,retro games. retro,False,"I mean I’m 15 so still a youngling for you Star Wars fans out there... I love the app I mean like me and my family were Disney fanatics like we go to Disney 2 times a year at least but back to the point I mean like it’s always fun and enjoyable to watch the old Disney movies and the new one’s but the app is great with the ability to download a movie in under 5 minutes is so nice that way on the airplane your never and bored staring out the window. The features that Disney includes are amazing like the ability to watch whatever you want. 
Thanks for reading and:
 “See ya real soon”. 

Thanks Disney."
2020-09-18 03:42:37,Continue watching,5,Tiff. V,False,"Love the app and I like that we can view what we are watching and continue it where we left off. But I do wish we could delete what we are no longer watching. For example we watch a movie and end at the credits. For that to not show up in the continue watching list we have to fast forward through the credits for it to no longer show in that list. Or even if we start watching a series for a show but lost interest, we should be able to get ride of it so we aren’t consistently seeing it in the continue watching list."
2020-07-10 19:30:33,"Mickey 🐭, ur gonna love these ideas.",5,artistickid08,False,"I. Love. This. App. It’s just so great and here are some ideas I think ur gonna love. 1. I think u should an option to watch live channels because some people may no what to watch so they they just choose live t.v. . 2. I also think that when kids around and u wanna put on like Disney junior but they don’t know how to spell it there should be a microphone option too. And the last thing I wanna talk about is that u should some games up there to. Because I always want to play Disney games and just relax. And this coming from a kid so u should probably listen. And that’s all, folks."
2019-11-13 21:33:06,This app is amazing yo,4,DeL Palm,False,I’m currently on the seven day free trial as of yesterday and I probably have over 60 movies and series add it to my watchlist this app is crazy has all the great classic Disney movies and shorts but the only downside is that if you’re watching a series it doesn’t leave you where you left off at and there are certain movies and series like “Sky high“ “black panther“ “the avengers infinity war“ and many more that are on the homepage but aren’t available until summer of next year why not just take them off and have them available when they’re available… But other than that I’ve literally been on this app strong in the last 48 hours and continuing
2020-01-10 03:24:29,!!!Caution!!!,2,rickd2554,False,"First let me start by saying I love the content and the overall design of the app. 

However, I recently had a need to remove someone from my account. I changed the password and they were still able to use it on the device they were already logged into. I spoke to tech support and there is no way to force all devices to logout and have to log back in.  I am very disappointed. My only option is to cancel and come back another time.  Most other apps similar to this do have an option to force logout. Its not a new technology and with lost devices and changing of them regularly in this technological world, it is an important need for everyone's account security.  Just changing your email or password should force a logout of all devices."
2019-12-21 07:58:14,Almost perfect 1990’s throw back,5,sonra the hedgehog,False,"This app has almost all of my favorite shows from when I was growing up as a kid the only issues is there are some missing for example the little mermaid TV series is missing a couple of episodes like I had to buy will the tail on the iTunes Store because it wasn’t listed other shows I hope Will be added soon include Aladdin on the TV series because without it we wouldn’t have gotten from return of Jafar to Aladdin and the King of Thieves and I definitely am not going onto Internet sites just to hunt down the diamond in a rough pun intended, plus where is house of mouse"
2019-12-05 01:58:28,"Love the content, app could use work",3,lawrenceville25,False,"I really enjoy the content on Disney Plus and have subscribed since it was available. However, some content is missing (a few DCOMs etc) and the app leaves features to be desired. I really wish that I could skip to the next episode and also skip the intro on shows. On shorter runtime shows this can be especially annoying. Also, the load always seems to freeze at 00:00:20 no matter what I’m watching. I also have trouble when I disconnect from one device and connect to another device: the episode starts over instead of starting where I stopped. 

Overall, nice app but could use some improvement. Nothing a company like Disney can’t implement."
2020-06-10 03:25:24,Apple TV app,4,Rsunshine rules,False,"Content is great but on Apple TV there is an issue.  When a movie ends and during the credits it goes small screen when the recommendation takes over - if one goes into the movie again and makes it full screen again, the Apple TV remote no longer works.  Ie...you can’t pause, ff, rewind.  All one can do is wait for the movie to end or hit the home button.

Also, please don’t put shows or movies in continue watching when we only have the credits left.  Continue watching gets full with all these movies that have 3 minutes left because kids clicked out of the credits. 

Thanks and keep up the good work"
2019-12-03 01:14:48,No option to select episodes different series episodes from ‘continued watching’ section,4,RACHdeannnnnn,False,"On netflix, in the ‘continue watching’ section, you can click on the show title and I’ll bring up the series and all of the episodes. Sometimes I fall asleep watching a show, so when I go back into the app, I want to be able to go back to previous episodes. On Disney+, you can either resume whatever episode you left off on, or you have to do a new search and find the show and find the episode you really want. Also, you should add Richie Rich since you have the holiday movie. Also ‘My date with the presidents daughter’ ;) thanks!"
2020-03-06 06:10:51,Disney+ App,1,bloodbought1,False,"Very disappointed first all adult Disney movies are not even on the platform not to mention all the marvel movies there not all on earthier also Caribbean movies there not all on either. sound quality is horrible! First all the marvel/ pirates of the Caribbean & star-wars movies should be in 4K ultra Hd with Dolby surround sound! there is no point in watching star-wars / pirates of the Caribbean & marvel movies with out the 4K! The sound quality through out the other movies is very poor too!  I Personally Love Disney movies and I do not like giving bad reviews! I felt compelled to do so! For Disney being a billion dollar company this new streaming launch is pretty awful! hopefully Disney will make a major overhaul to there new streaming app! 
First Disney needs to put all there adult Disney movies on!
Second the sound needs to be fixed
Third it needs be more user friendly 
Fourth offer picks from your own photo library instead of just the animated characters 
Fifth kids are not the only people that enjoy Disney movies 
Adults enjoy too if your going to have a streaming platform for adults too than cater to that not just your child audience
Love Disney please fix theses major issues so I can come back and be one of your consumers"

Now that I have signed up, I’m in Colorado and it tells me I am out of service area, my IP is a Denver metro city, and the error tells you to contact service center. Now the true horrible begins, it takes me 10-15min to find a phone number, then I call and I am on hold for 13min, and it hangs up, then on hold 16min and it hangs up, then on for around 10 and it hangs up.  Finally I try text and I am at 17min, and it says I have another 9 to go, but that number keeps moving.  I have been looking forward to this service, but this is just too much work, and what horrible service! I get it is new, but I have never seen anything worse.  Disney should be able to have a solid product and service."
2019-11-23 04:03:08,Sound cutting out?,4,izzy12432,False,"So first I’d like to start by saying that I love what’s on the app and all the different movie and tv show choices but what I don’t love is that my speaker is messed up while using this app and only this app. I could have the volume on my phone on high and then the volume will just drop down to a very low volume all of a sudden. I’ve tried to see if it was my phone but discovered that my speaker only acts out when using this app, my speaker works fine with all my other apps so therefore it has to be this app messing with my speaker. Again love the content in this app but would love it if the volume issue could be checked out! Thanks!"
2019-11-27 16:50:08,"Overall, amazing! C:",5,Eshal Hassan,False,"So, I got Disney+ a few days after it came out and I’m so glad that they added a continue watching! The only problem I have now, is when I’m watching a series picture in picture while playing games. When I’m watching a series in picture and picture, if I finish the episode, it doesn’t continue on to the next episode and I’d have to reenter the app and close my game. It’s a problem because I play games like roblox which are online. 
         (P.S. It’s 5 stars because not many people watch Disney+ picture in picture so it’s not really that big of a problem.)"
2019-11-16 18:09:56,"Perfect for any Disney fan, but...",4,Kristian_422,False,"I was so excited for Disney+ to come, and when I first opened the app I was overjoyed to see so many of my favorite wonderful shows and films in one place. My only complaint, however, is there’s no easy way to pick up where I left off. A few episodes into Recess, I realized it doesn’t mark episodes as watched. You have to commit to memory what episode you last saw, which might be a problem if you step away for a while or if you get far into a series. You just have to keep scrolling until you find where you left off. Other than that, great service. It will keep me entertained for a very long time."
2019-11-15 18:34:30,Missing one MASSIVE feature,4,UsernameIsAlreadyTaken44,False,"Very nice clean app, also wonderful that all of the Disney movies can be found in one place! My family loves it! The app would have 5 stars if it had a continue or resume watching section. It’s so frustrating to be in the middle of a series, and have to go through all the seasons and episodes to find the one to watch next if you happen to leave for a bit. With movies too, if I have to continue watching a movie at a later time, I have to search that movie title again to pull it up. Very frustrating and it needs to be fixed, people aren’t going to stop complaining until there is a fix in place!"
2019-11-16 07:08:23,Amazing but could use some overall improvements,3,Need more passes !,False,"First off, Disney + is amazing when it comes to all the Disney originals, Marvel, Pixar, and National Geographic. However, the app could use some fixes such as: having a start from the beginning option when watching something, have a continue watching tab to keep track of what you was watching last, a fix with streaming on VIZIO devices ( which is probably VIZIO fault not Disney), and being able to cast directly from the Disney app on my phone to my fire Tv. I have Disney + on my fire tv but when I try to cast from my phone it doesn’t work but connects to my VIZIO tv upstairs even though it’s not compatible ? It is great but has some technical problems already."
2019-11-14 02:13:34,Wow!,5,yeetTJ,False,"They weren’t joking when they said that they were rereleasing everything! This streaming service is awesome. Even though it has it’s flaws and bugs it is still great. I still can’t believe that they even rereleased all 30 seasons on The Simpson’s. If you are a Disney, Pixar, Star Wars, Marvel, and National Geographic fan this is the app for you. This is, in my opinion, the superior streaming service out right now. Even with their original content like The Madalorian is still really cool. I can’t wait for the last season of the Clone Wars as well. As long as they keep releasing fresh and original content they will keep fans happy."
2020-01-26 08:59:12,Must have app🤩,4,DisplacedTXN,False,"Update ver 1.2.2:  Now I finally get to watch my favorite Disney films, some which I have not seen since the days of VHS. Great Content, most in 4K HDR🤓. Mandalorian alone is worth the price. However the player still needs work. Scrubbing works just ok, but 10s jumps are hit and miss. Also, the auto play next episode feature does not work on many Disney Channel shows.  So for those that like to each the same shows over again, be prepared for some frustration. You will need to manually scrub every episode back to the start in order to watch it a second time. Otherwise you will just be watching the end credits again😢."
2020-05-30 20:27:22,Best streaming app!!,5,amaziiiiiiiiiing apppppps,False,"Finally I have found the app that I wanted .. Disney plus is a very amazing app.. it provides a lot of those great movies and tv shows that we all love ,, also it provides content that is suitable for children, teens and adults the whole family can watch together ,, what I like about it is that you can pay through iTunes .. which is something that I hope for it to stay.. ,, and Disney is constantly adding new movies shows that we recommend.. so if you are looking for an app to stream nearly all your favorite movies and tv shows that’s the one 👍🏻👍🏻"
2020-03-21 00:45:04,Awesome but need to be all of Disney,3,Ras011998,False,"I love Disney plus and it’s an awesome app but what about the rest of Disney. I would be willing to pay extra to add Disney now subscription as an extension of Disney plus. Disney now app is a great app especially for kids. Disney Now app features a lot of content that is only viewable with a subscription from a tv provider that are NOT on Disney Plus. Theses are shows and movies that I believe should be on Disney Plus. Two out of many examples would be Disney Junior and Pokémon. They are both shown on Disney Now (some requires a tv provider) but are not on Disney Plus. I don’t see myself getting a tv provider, because I’m use to and prefer streaming. Please allow content on Disney Now to be on Disney Plus."
2020-02-19 19:40:53,Watchlist,3,i3kalb,False,"Personalizing a watchlist on each account has been the biggest waste of time since the day D+ was released. Movies disappear from the list, though they have a green check next to the title, and you can only add a small handful of movies, or it deletes one in order to add another one. Watchlist should be nearly limitless and easily customizable. (I.e easily remove items from the list, selecting multiple at a time, and the ability to move items around in an order that is wanted, or at least have the ability to put them in alphabetical order or by release date) Three stars for this issue, and because of the never-ending playback errors that still exist, months later."
2019-11-19 02:32:24,It’s almost overwhelming!,4,Dcamonkeys,False,"There is so much on the service, but it’s not organized very well. It bugs me that we can’t organize movies or series alphabetically or by release date, for instance. It would also really be handy to be able to organize our watch lists, especially with user-created categories. I’ve resisted putting too much into my watch list so it isn’t too unwieldy to look through. And an indicator on the thumbnail of something that isn’t currently available (or the ability to filter by that criterion, among others) would be very useful. I hope that more functionality will appear in the app soon."
2019-12-30 21:50:45,Disney + is the greatest with one problem,5,Qwerty5298,False,"When I write reviews, I usually say the app is amazing and I don’t really criticize what the developers have done but I only have one major problem with Disney plus. When I get on the app, it sometimes switches files and I end up having to watch stuff on other profiles. When Disney plus came out it has some problems but most of those have been addressed and I’m happy for that, but can you please read my review and fix this problem. Disney is the best app I have ever paid for and I would like my full streaming experience to be perfect."
2019-12-11 00:53:50,Can’t verify email,1,Will_Killmore,False,"Bought a year subscription the first day it came out. Weeks later, I still cannot verify my email because it doesn’t send me a verification email. No, it’s not going to my spam folder. I’ve sat on hold for two multiple hour phone calls without ever reaching anyone. And have received two responses, each a week apart, to my twitter inbox asking the same question, “what email is your account assigned to?” even though I’ve provided that information in the previous messages, and the response a week later is the same question. I figured there’d be some bugs to work through at launch, but weeks later I still don’t have a resolution to my issue. It seems Disney is raking in enough dough that they don’t feel it necessary to take five minutes to resolve this customer’s problem."
2019-11-16 14:32:36,Could be better,4,Lotus46,False,"I love that Disney finally has their own app with most of their movies and shows. I am still waiting for them to release everything but I’m sure that will come in time. 
My biggest problem with this app is that when I have to stop watching a show or movie and come back to it later it doesn’t start where I left off. It starts over and I have to find my spot. This becomes especially challenging when my kids are watching a show and I don’t know what season or episode they are on! 
So as soon as Disney decides to add that feature as well as a continue watching section (like Netflix) this app will be perfect."
2019-11-29 00:50:39,It’s an amazing app but …,4,Games & Apps rule,False,There’s stuff missing. Ok so this app is so amazing I love it I have so much fun watching all the cool things but ... there’s some cool and awesome shows missing that we love so much ... I know there might be more missing but I searched for Ant farm and Austin and Ally and nothing shows up ... o didn’t search for more but I would love that u put the og’s on here ... you will make my dream come true … also like the newest movies are missing two like decedents 3 ... not that new but it’s recent ... anyways hope u guys in the future update the app and in the update more shows and movies will appear from our childhoods and now ... hopefully u see this and have a bless ... bye 👋
2019-11-14 13:08:14,Why?,3,Gemini316,False,"Great content. My 21 yo, 19yo, 16yo, and myself absolutely love watching all the old Disney shows we all grew up on....Except their absolute favorite The Proud Family, and my favorite Disney Princess movie Princess and the Frog. Is there a reason these Black shows are not available? I know there are other Black shows available, but my girls grew up on Proud Family and were disappointed it was not available. Yes, I know they are all old in kid years. And I’m probably too old to want to be a Disney Princess, but Princess and the Frog gave my Black daughters a Black Princess to look up too and want to be for Halloween. I know my review will probably get lost in the many reviews. I still hope to see Proud Family and Princess and the Frog on the app real soon."
2019-11-14 03:19:17,Eh,3,BobTheEvilPotato,False,It’s pretty good so far but some movies it just shows me trailers and I can’t watch the ACTUAL movie and it keeps narrating EVERYTHING?!?  it may not bother other people but It gets on my nerves more than the lady with her kids watching “KiDs bOp” like it will be like “Ariel kisses Sebastian and sits him back down” and stuff like that. And it’s like everything I watch so far. Sometimes it talks over the characters voices so the. I can’t hear anything that they are saying and it makes me super mad so idk if I want to use this app very much anymore so I might just go back to using my old dvds 😂 bcz they at least don’t have a narroratir . But otherwise the app still works okay. Mine freezes up somethimes.. but it can still work pretty good u guess
2019-11-13 20:35:18,Some bugs but great to have,3,bookindawn,False,"Ok so, I’m finding movies I thought I would never get to watch again cause I literally could not find them online or on disc. It’s amazing. The app it’s self has some issues. Movies are shown multiple times in a row like 3 animated Alice in wonderlands next to each other instead of other shown in that category. There is no continue watching category so you have to search the show you were watching every time you wanna find it. It’s also difficult to get on in certain places. Error codes pop up saying it not available an a certain regions it should be available. But the quality of shows and streaming is great. I’m excited to watch the movies of my childhood"
2019-11-13 13:46:10,Starts series over from beginning every time Urg!!,3,GreedP,False,"I have used Disney plus for a full day now. It has several glitches, but the buggiest issue is when watching a series it doesn’t sync between applications ie different TV’s or iPad and it doesn’t pick up where you left off (like Netflix) - it starts you over at season 1 episode 1. That’s ANNOYING! Also I have had to save to my watch list on each TV, iPad, or iPhone we have. It didn’t sync between all of them automatically. I realize they will fix and work out bug and issues in the days to come, but please, please, please fix the issue of starting from where viewers ended their last view vs starting show or movie over from beginning."
2019-11-12 12:42:49,A Few Launch Issues,3,Ixtaek,False,"Was excited to rewatch some cartoons, but several (DuckTales, Phineas and Ferb) are out of order, which is a problem for a series with season-long story arcs. Plus some shows (Gravity Falls, DuckTales) do not show all the episodes when you open them, forcing you to watch or fast forward through an episode then pick “See All Episodes.” This does not unlock them permanently and you have to do it again if you are planning to watch any out of order or try to skip to the latest episode. I also managed to blank out the home screen, no idea how.

Very content packed, but needs some fixes! Hopefully the lower rating will alert them to the issue so we can all enjoy these shows!"

Then I became a princess overnight now I gotta figure out how to do it right, so much to learn and see.  Up in the castle with my new family, in a school that’s just for royalty. A whole enchanted world in waiting for me. I’m so excited to be Sofia the first! I’m finding out what being royal’s all about. SOFIA THE FIRST! Making my way it’s an adventure everyday. SOFIA.

I really enjoy watching all of my old favorite Disney channel series on it. It brings back some great memories from movies I love!! The only thing that bothers me with the app OCCASIONALLY is that sometimes it takes forever to load when you are in an area with not the best WiFi. That is not the type of thing I would dock a star for, and I definitely recommend this app to anyone looking for a good app to watch movies and shows on. I love everything else about this app!

The app takes a minute or two to open and load the page and after about 15 minutes of not being in the app I have to reload it and reconnect to the chome cast even though it is still play. The worst thing about it is even if the movie says “resume” or “continue watching” it starts the whole movie over if you connect before hitting resume, if you resume on your device and then connct to your tv it works fine. Disney+ does not care and has yet to address the issue which has been going on since the start. Need to get the people from netflix to make a proper app since I have no issues with that one.."
2019-12-06 03:03:57,Why can't I get full screen on my iPad?,5,OG IceCastles,False,"I find it a little strange that I can't view anything in full screen.  It doesn't even auto rotate depending on how you're holding the iPad.  I thought maybe a setting was off, but there isn't one to adjust.  When I stream from other apps, the screen adjusts accordingly.  I hate watching everything in a little box on my 10"" screen.  Makes no sense using an iPad with this app if it won't take advantage of the device's screen size.  At least if it rotated, that would have been a little better, but it doesn't even do that."
2019-11-25 02:49:26,Love it!,4,Jerokyn,False,"Definitely love Disney plus! It works great on my phone connected to the tv via hdmi adapter. I love the content. The app is clean and pretty simple to navigate. I’ve seen others say it and I’ll say it too. How do I know what I’ve watched and not watched? We need a continue watching section and a way to tell if we’ve started playing something or finished it and where are we in it?

Also, we need to find our watchlist easier than going into the profile and clicking a few things. It should have its own place on the front screen near the top much like Netflix. 

Otherwise, I love the experience and content. Works better than Apple TV+!"
2019-11-18 16:29:56,So much to watch!,5,Ducktapemania,False,"Giving this 5 stars! I had my doubts about how awesome this streaming service was going to be, didn’t realize it was going to have so much to watch. I spent my first night after signing up, picking out movies and shows that I want to watch with my kids, movies I used to watch on VHS, and shows that I haven’t seen in almost 20 years. It’s been a good blast from the past! Missing some Disney junior shows that my youngest would definitely love, but I’m going to give it time for it to come up, can’t be disappointed in all that we have to choose from in the mean time!"
2019-11-17 00:40:12,I Love It!,4,Breana Sanchez,False,"Really good app. My sisters and I love all the shows and movies, especially since we grew up watching them. My dad is watching the National Geographic shows. We really like it and the deal we got with Verizon. But I have read through some reviews and I agree with some. Like adding a continue watching list. And I have seen all of the TikTok’s that it’s a war between Disney+ and Netflix. Both are really good apps. I love both. I have no problems with this app and I am really enjoying everything. Ultimately, the only flaw that should be fixed and added is the continue watching list. That is why I put 4 stars and not 5. Thank you Disney for this app. 💝💝💝💖💖💖"
2019-11-23 11:24:52,Continue watching.,4,Tierra j,False,"***Edit**** you fixed the “resume” watching when you click on the show or movie, but it isn’t up front or lost somewhere easily seem. I have to try to remember what I’m watching, and what episode or season I’m on when I’m watching a series. Super inconvenient. The app is almost perfect. The only thing that is missing is a “continue watching” feature. Even though whatever I’m watching will pick up where I stopped watching, I have to go back to the menu to go back to it. And that is especially frustrating when I am watching a series and have to remember what episode I left off at. Please fix this. TIA"
2019-11-16 23:16:57,Love it but sound really needs to be fixed,3,Frequent_User_6,False,"I am a huge Disney fan and have been looking forward to the Mandalorian since it was first announced.  Overall lots of great content and I was surprised by all the good non-traditional Disney shows that are available.

Now for the reason I only gave 3 stars.  The sound is not consistent on any show, on any platform. I have to turn the volume all the way up to hear normal speaking conversations but then turn the volume down in the action scenes because it gets way too loud.  Watching on a plane with sound isolation headphones, even with volume turned all the way up, I couldn’t really hear the quiet conversation parts of Guardians of the Galaxy and Mandalorian.  Disney... please fix..."
2020-01-30 21:41:21,"Good, but could be improved!",3,whopper2435,False,"The app has gotten more user friendly since it’s start, but I am still noticing some things that I think would make it better. The first thing I have noticed is when I pull down on my phone screen to check a message or something, the show/movie continues to play instead of pausing, like the Netflix app does. The second thing would be that the fast forward/rewind 10-second along with the pause button only come up sometimes - when they aren’t there, it’s a circling ‘loading’ signal even when the show/movie is playing. These are just a couple of the very ‘nit-picky’ things I have seen that could make the app better!"
2019-12-21 15:19:39,It’s a Very Nice,5,JB5236,False,"Impressed with a lot of what I’ve seen here. I appreciate how much has been opened up from the Disney vault for our viewing pleasure. I’ve also made good use of the download functionality for when I’m on the go to conserve data, so that’s nice. There’s good value for the money here. I’m glad I got a year free from Verizon to get me started. I personally anyways haven’t yet experienced any technical difficulties with the app. I just wish there was a share functionality so I could use Facebook or Messages to share my favorite shows and movies. I want to spread the word about Togo, loved it! 👍"

Shows it’s amazing"
2019-12-05 14:50:55,OMG what the heck this is the best thing that has ever happened to me,5,Chebaug,False,"Omg I love this so flipping much. Like before, I watched Disney Now and it didn’t cost me anything but you had to UNLOCK an episode if you wanted to watch it. And that, was very hard. And also, you could only unlock, like, 2 episodes once a month. The struggle, was real. Look, I may just seem like wuss wagon here, but it hard. Like, I wanted to watch camp rock, but I couldn’t because I hadn’t unlocked it. So I went to Apple to watch it, and guess what? IT SENT ME BACK TO DISNEY NOW!!!! But when Disney+ came out, I was crying. I mean, you can watch stuff that isn’t even out yet, like lady and the tramp live action. Also, don’t forget mandorlorian! (Baby yoda, marry me) sure, it’s 6 bucks a month, but that’s an amazing deal. I’m so excited for new episodes this Friday for MANDELORIAAAAAN! So yes, this app is AWESOME. 

A dream is a wish your heart makes.

My dream already came true. Thank u everyone who works at Disney, for making something huge."
2019-11-24 14:50:42,"App is fine, extremely difficult to cancel",3,mandy9999988,False,"I signed up for the free trial via my iTunes account - the app worked just fine! However, I decided the content wasn’t worth it for me. The issue I had was cancellation. If you sign up on phone like I did, it is very difficult to cancel! You have to go through the iTunes app (which did not work on my phone, so I had to use my laptop), login about 6 different times, and the instructions to cancel on Disney+’s FAQs are still inaccurate. I had to contact Apple support and “report a problem” to even have the option to cancel.
Overall, the app itself is fine, but do not sign up through your iPhone if you think you may not use it!!"
2019-11-21 21:00:33,Love it... but,4,karina8+1D,False,"I am obsessed with Disney plus and the future things it will bring. But I find it a but uncomfortable that it doesn’t have a “continue watching” feature. It would make it for the viewer so my so much easy to continue watching their favorite shows. So far we have to search the show we want to watch. I also would like to add I’m not aware of every programming it may offer since the home page always shows the same programing. Please mind adding a “because you watched *xyz*” type of feature that can show other shows or movies that are within your interest.

Much love and continue the good work."
2020-07-19 18:01:16,Great Content but app needs work,4,Maservin70,False,They have great content but the app needs work. When watching a series it always starts me like 5 episodes behind from where I stopped watching. Then I have to fast forward that episode just to get to the episode list. It should start you at the episode list instead of it streaming right way.  Same thing for movies. It starts me off where I left off even if I finished the movie so I have to rewind like a vhs. Which is very annoying. My 5 yr old is very techy and is able to use other streaming apps on her own but I had to teach her that she has to rewind in order to restart the movie.
2019-11-20 05:13:42,Amazed initially. Looking forward to improvements.,5,happygodavid,False,"It’s fantastic. 

Need everything Disney has ever done. Organized into better categories. When I can easily bounce between animated, classic movies, new stuff like the Mandelorian, and series like Zorro, I’ll pay $20 a month. Just give me everything Disney ever made and I’m sold for life. For now, I’m an in-and-out customer. Put it all there, get rid of the Vault, and I’m done. 

Or, if you’re gonna keep the vault, at least give me an option to purchase while it’s out of the vault. I want this to be a thing I pass down to my kids when I have them."
2020-02-01 02:39:41,Absolutely love but there’s one problem,4,jmwalkie,False,"I downloaded the app when it first came out and it is absolutely wonderful!! However, one problem has caused me great sadness: every once in a while it will sign me out and I can’t sing back in! It tells me to call customer service when I try. This happened two days after I first downloaded it, I canceled my subscription and signed in with a different account. For a while, it worked, until today when it happened again! I just want to know what that’s about. Otherwise, it’s fantastic, keep making original series and I will keep throwing my money at you, Disney!!"
2019-12-29 21:40:15,Great streaming service,4,joelito337,False,I love Disney+ but their some features that need to be added like for example on Netflix right after you finish watching an episode a little red line shows up which it shows you that you watch that episode already and on Disney+ it doesn’t I sometimes forget which episodes I watch because it doesn’t show a blue line on continue watching it shows a blue line that shows you where you left off at also another issue is that some movies are not available to watch some you wait a while to come out for example some are releasing in 2020 and other in 2021 why is that
2019-12-21 17:52:04,Decent but one major complaint,4,Olney929,False,"Love that Disney has put all of their titles in one place, making it so easy to access all of your favorites. My one major complaint is that if you log out of the app, all of your items downloaded to watch offline disappear. My daughter accidentally logged out of her app right before a 6 hour flight and the movies she had downloaded to watch while on the flight no longer were there when we logged her back in. This might seem trivial but we were then unable to download anything as we were at the airport. This is a feature that should be fixed"
2019-12-15 03:18:35,"Love it, but bugs need fixed ASAP",4,JHample,False,I love Disney+. I love having all these Disney movies at my fingertips for my family to watch. Especially the older ones that they have never seen. However I keep running into the same issue of getting kicked out of a movie we are watching and then when I go back and try and click on it...it won’t open and it’s not just that movie. I can maneuver through the app but can’t play any movies. I usually wind up getting frustrated and exiting out and coming back hours later but I shouldn’t have to do that with a paid app. Please fix soon so we can continue to enjoy the Disney+ app.
2019-11-26 01:35:13,The app needs work. Content 🔥,4,~*messo*~,False,"I know it is new but ... the app borders on annoying *now less annoying* 

Going from things like Netflix, xfinity and even AppleTV ... to this leaves a lot to be desired. Your Watchlist isn’t easily accessible, it’s under your profile. *edit/updated* they are making improvements!! “Continue watching” was added! Makes it much easier to watch a series Mandalorian is amazing!! ... 

 It’s easy enough to restart something from the beginning however the only option is to “resume” then start over. 

I love that Netflix pauses play when you are trying to turn off/on subtitles. Disney+ drops down this fog screen that blurs your view and whatever you’re watching continues to play. At least if you’re going to continue to play it shouldn’t cover the entire screen .. like xfinity. 

I also noticed that there are recommendations now as well ;) ... it’s getting there. 

The interface itself is honestly beautiful. I’m loving the content. Hopefully it only improves from here."
2019-11-27 04:46:04,Great idea but needs work!,3,HeadmasterSnape,False,"I love how much Disney+ offers! And I’m happy that the developers have added the “continue watching” feature. But it’s annoying that there’s no “view all” option for different categories. You either have to remember all the movies you used to watch, or hope that a movie shows up in the suggested list of another movie. 
For example, I didn’t see ‘Heavyweights’ in the list of 90s movies or throwbacks. It wasn’t until I watched ‘The Sandlot’ that I saw ‘Heavyweights’ in the suggested list. There should be an option to view ALL 90s movies, not just some. Or ALL Action/Adventure, not just a few. 
Maybe simplifying the way you categorize the movies will allow you to do this."
2019-11-12 13:40:02,Finally!,5,Lovingmayra,False,"So excited it’s here and this will replace my other subscriptions. I love it, the content, the layout and especially for my daughter to watch all her favorite shows. 
My only issue that I found was and don’t know if it’s just me but there seems to be a glitch on any series when switching between seasons where it doesn’t update the episodes instead it’ll show the previous ones when just browsing and it seems as if I have to remember where I am in a series especially if you didn’t start at episode 1. Other than that I absolutely love it!"
2020-07-20 01:58:41,Idea for Disney+,5,| Ethan A |,False,"I like this entertainment app with companies that Disney owns. I usually like Disney apps where dreams can come true. But this one was epic enough that it became No.4 in Entertainment. Here’s why I’m writing this : so 11 days ago, I had a note in my mail app from My Disney and it said something about new updates, exclusive offers, new movie trailers, and birthday messages. Then, I saw that four of the companies Disney owns that I know weren’t on Disney+. So here what you should add, you should add Lucasfilm Ltd, ABC, Freeform, and ESPN. I don’t if it will happen or not, but I bet this will happen in an update soon."
2020-08-02 19:42:56,Fix the download playback issues!,2,jbthenerd,False,"I live in a rural area without internet so I heavily rely on going in to town to download shows on my iPad  and then watch them at home via a lighting dock connector to my tv. Getting content this way has been very difficult during the pandemic, but has been made more frustrating by the fact that when doing this I get playback issues. 

Downloaded episodes or movies will play fine on my iPad alone, but as soon as I connect it to my tv via the dock connector I get  the “oh no, something went wrong playing X”. But it will play fine on the iPad when the connector is removed. Please fix this! I enjoy the content available on the app but I’m rarely able to use it because of this issue!"
2019-12-17 22:54:53,"It’s great, but some content needs to be added",4,Tamas DiLorenzo,False,"I’ve been using the app since a day or two after it came out and I can say that so far it’s been great. I like that it uses my default subtitles that I set on my iPhone and iPad. But there are things that can be added for all of the movies and the big addition has to be director’s commentary. I expected to see it at launch but it wasn’t available yet. There are some fantastic commentary tracks for Pixar, Marvel, and Star Wars that aren’t available to view yet on Disney+. Once these are added I can’t see much to improve on, because overall the app has been and is still fantastic."
2019-11-13 17:14:59,Needs “Continue Watching” List,4,Bri829,False,"Love love love all the content on Disney+! Completely brings my childhood back.
Only problem is if I close the app and go back in, there’s no “Continue Watching” list. So i have to search for the tv series I was watching. I also have to figure out which episode I was on as there is no red bar like Netflix to show that you finished an episode or where you left off. 
It’s also a problem for my son as he can’t always remember which episode he left off on since he can’t see a red bar and pressing the play button goes back to the first episode. 
Please fix this and it will be absolutely perfect."
2019-12-02 01:49:41,Money Scheme?,2,FABBMN,False,"After using our subscription for about a week, our Disney + account was cancelled without notice even after paying for the subscription for an entire year. Calling customer service was pointless as they only said that we would have to pay the full amount we already paid for the year long subscription AGAIN instead of restoring our account status or refunding. I’ve heard of the same thing happening to other people as well, so I wouldn’t bother paying for an account if they just take it away from you a week later. The only reason this has 2 stars is because the app worked fine and had great content, it’s unfortunate that such a large company would fail to rectify this issue."
2019-12-01 02:56:33,Great family streaming service,5,MOM/KARTER,False,"My entire family loves Disney+ !! We constantly find new movies and shows to watch. I am a huge fan of the Disney originals as well. Like Noelle, and Mandalorian. (Baby yoda will melt your heart) for anyone that isn’t giving this streaming service 5 stars is just not patient enough. They’re a new streaming service and still working out all the kinks and btw they’re doing great with releasing new updates. I know you all remember when Netflix first came out and oh boy it’s been a long road. Give Disney+ the same chance you gave Netflix. That’s all. 

Stay weird, enjoy !"
2019-11-22 04:23:35,Missing key features,3,tdunnavant,False,"The app looks amazing. The content is extensive and presented well. The app functions flawlessly and presents video in extremely good quality. I also like the fact that you can create accounts. However, there are 2 key features that nearly every other streaming service offers that Disney+ has left out: 1) a continue watching que - if I have to leave a video and do something else for a bit, it takes awhile to search for what I was watching again, and 2) there is no “watch list” I can create in order to easily find shows or movies I want to watch later. These really should be no-brainer features included in any streaming service"
2019-11-18 18:25:43,Service is fantastic.  App is subpar.,3,Chilibean22,False,"For a release like this, with the resources that they have, I expected so much more from Disney on this App.  It’s like they purposely left off several of what have become key features of streaming platforms.  Things like a Currently Watching tab, or a way to start a movie over that doesn’t require a manual “rewind” of the movie.  For shows, it does not keep your place in the series; you either have to remember the exact episode, or roll through several of them.

These are all simple things.  If the app wasn’t so clunky, everyone would give it 5 stars.  Really, most people who have given it 5 stars, are only grading the content, rather than the app."
2019-11-16 18:03:18,App needs improvement,2,StephanieLovesUnicorns,False,"It’s getting pretty annoying when I need to find the show every single time to watch it! The show or the movie does not appear for me as “Recently watched” theres not even an option of recently watched!! Thats insane thats one of the most important things to add on the app! I literally have to go to the search bar every single time to watch the show I was watching or the movie I haven’t finished watching. Also sometimes when I click on the show that I am watching it takes me right back to episode one! And I don't even remember where I left off. This app looks so simple and doesn’t even look like they put a lot of work into it, hopefully a new update will come so it can fix all these problems."
2020-08-06 22:18:57,put the tv episodes in order!,4,Sparks&Sparkles,False,"I have to start off by saying I love this app. I watch something on it almost every day. The only reason I am leaving a review is so that hopefully someone who works their will see this because the show I was watching the episodes were not in the right order! In Austin and Ally Season 4 episode 19 and 20 should be switched! *spoiler (I had no idea when they had got engaged, who was running the music store, since when was Trish and actress, etc) I had to go back and rewatch it cause I was so confused 😅 so it’s a great app just I would appreciate it if the episodes are in the right order! Thanks"
2020-10-01 17:54:15,Watchlist,3,name2unique,False,"For how much I'm paying for the service, the app is pretty limited. The most annoying pain point for me is that my watchlist doesn't show all the items I added to it. I thought this was just a TV app glitch but unfortunately it seems to be a problem with the Disney+ interface. It's like there's a limited amount that you can add before it disappears from the list. I have to manually search for a show/movie I might've added to the list a month ago. It'll show a check mark signifying that it's in my list but when I go to my list, it's not there. I rely on the watch list for easier access and filtration to things I actually want to watch."
2020-03-25 03:23:07,"Great content, awful video player",4,<bool>,False,"The video player needs to hide it’s controls when you pause, or know the difference between swiping from the bottom of your screen and actually trying to skip. Really, very annoying to be watching Gravity Falls or Pixar, looking for easter eggs, pausing, and having the skip and pause buttons in the way. Also annoying to pull up control center, to change brightness, volume, headphones/speaker, and skip to the end of the movie the 13th time. I leave the app to change volume. 4/5.

Actually, can we just have Apples built in video player? That’s what I really want"
2019-11-19 22:24:52,No “Currently Watching” Option,4,MrsMcChickenPatty,False,"The app is great, and has all my favorite shows, but I think a “currently watching”/“continue watching” list should be available on the main page of the app. 

there is a watch list, which works just the same, but when you click on a show there is no play button that will pick up where you left off. you have to scroll down to the episode you last watched. netflix has a button that says “resume S1 E15” which makes watching a tv show much easier

maybe i’m just being lazy, but the app could stand to have more shortcuts. other than that, it’s great"
2020-03-17 07:20:56,It’s a good app but...,3,Teoolol,False,"It’s awesome having mostly every Disney show/movie made in just one app. It’s just not worth what your paying, you don’t really get every single movie/show Disney has put out or if it’s there episodes are missing. You should really consider adding in a lot more content. I see a lot marvel movies missing, Disney XD shows are missing, episodes of Disney shows. If you see people spend there money on this you should really consider what you advertise because it’s not on the app. They advertise so much stuff and not even half is actually there. Some say coming soon, but aren’t even on the app. What is this really?? It just looks like disney is trying to make more money."
2020-02-04 15:39:27,Disappointed with “Offline” viewing,3,bonyknees2,False,"First, we love the app and the availability of the old Disney classics!  “Offline viewing” would seem to make it useable for us without unlimited high speed internet availability at home.

Our thought was download content to a phone when in an area with good signal, and then at home (with poor internet service) to airplay to an AppleTv over our WiFi.  Air playing offline Disney+ content that is already on a phone apparently will NOT play directly from the phone to the AppleTV on WiFi , but downloads the movie AGAIN over the internet To the AppleTV.  We do not have enough data or speed at home to do that.  Was the Airplay play feature of Disney+ intentionally designed that way?  

The same appears to be true when casting from the phone to a smart tv.

Bottom line: if I don’t have a high speed unlimited connection, I cannot watch an offline previously downloaded movie on any Device other than the device it was downloaded on.  Pretty hard to have a family movie night watching it on a phone."
2020-01-06 16:19:43,Disappointed,2,friday13thbdaygirl,False,"I love the content Disney+ has, but I’m really disappointed. We unfortunately live in a rural area where we can’t get good internet, so I was really excited to discover you could download Disney+ content to your device. It worked great for my kids, because I could download things to their tablets for in the car. However, lately things have NOT been wanting to load. Sometimes I have to restart the app, sometimes I have to restart their tablets, and sometimes that doesn’t even work. Even thought they are DOWNLOADED, so there should be absolutely no reason that they won’t load. It has caused many a tantrum, and serious disappointment. If it does it much longer, I will unfortunately be canceling my subscription."

Wonderful World of Disney classics with Walt Disney on here! As far as the App. If I check something to add to my watch list it adds it but if I go back into the movie I just added it’s no longer checked as added and that gets confusing making me wonder if I added it already or not, it should stay checked till I remove it....if I leave the app. and then come back I would like a “currently or recently watched list to go to so I can get back to what I was just watching faster. Other than those small things....the App. would be ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️!!"
2019-11-19 04:05:24,Great app but needs a few major things,3,ONC/DKT,False,"The Disney plus app is great. A real blast from the past. There are a few major features that are missing such as a “currently watching” or a “continue watching” list. I would like to see “my personal favorite” list on the home screen instead of having to click on my profile to find my list. There needs to be an indicator bar showing you where you left off and there needs to be an indicator knowing what episodes your watched. I noticed there are duplicates on my personal favorites list. Also I noticed if I try to take a screenshot, the picture is black screen instead of the actual picture showing."
2019-11-17 15:17:12,"Love It, But Needs Some Tweaks",4,Arisoawesome,False,"I love Disney & this app is wonderful! However, I do wish that there was a currently watching/continue watching area where I can pick up where I left off instead of having to type in or find what I was watching. 
Also, when I search on the app for all movies a-z, it only shows about 15-20 movies. And even when I break it down to a specific genre, it only shows a small portion of all the movies I know are on there. And it does the same for TV shows as well. 
I know the app is new and upcoming, so I’m not expecting it to be perfect, but if these two things could be considered, I think it’d be 5 stars!"
2019-11-12 17:51:29,Disney Rocks!!!!,5,JusticeJack,False,"Everything that Disney owns at your finger tips for an incredible low price, what more can you ask for? 

I am a parent in his 40s with small kids, and until now I really couldn’t find the animated series that I watched as a small kid to share with them.  I loved the Gummi Bears, Tale Spin, Rescue Rangers, the original Duck Tales, and so many more.  Getting to sit down with them this morning and watch some of those shows with them before school, was like being a kid again on Christmas morning. 

Thank you Disney, don’t change a thing selection wise and you have a customer for life."
2020-10-03 03:37:01,Group Watching,5,Escrypha,False,"I absolutely love group watching! It is fantastic how my family won’t have to count down from 3 to synchronize our viewings when my step-father is away. I love it so much, and that warrants an easy 5 from me! =‘D 

However, I dislike the exclusive nonsense around the new Mulan. $30 on top of a subscription? It feels like it exploits FOMO! I think it should have been released at regular online movie fronts (your iTunes, Google Play, etc...) like how Scoob!, Face the Music, and the Trolls sequel. I really hope you don’t repeat it for Black Widow. Either way, it’s stayin’ at 5 for me! Awesome work!"
2019-11-12 15:58:38,Glitchy,3,IIx Athena xII,False,"I love Disney, which is why my review is greater than one star. However, the app is not running as smoothly as everyone else claims it to be. I know the app had just began today, and I am expected the experience some minor glitches but it does get annoying. I have to close the app every single time and let it load again. Sometimes when I open the app, the brands are missing. Sometimes I only see “Disney and Pixar”. Then when I close the app they all come up “Disney, Pixar, National Geographic, Marvel and Star Wars.” Its very frustrating. Half the time the shows are missing too. I hope this glitch is fixed soon, I really don’t want to have to do this every time I want to watch a show."
2020-01-30 02:51:05,Great app but loading and crashes,4,JessNicole199203,False,"I love this app!! Best Disney idea ever BUT ever since day 1, the app on my iPhone won’t load and my internet connection is strong. Or it’ll just crash and close it out on its own and I have to go back into the app and find my show again. I’ve tried it on my Chromebook and it glitches and shuts down. And that’s with a strong connection. Please fix bugs. Or create separate networks for certain regions so an abundant amount of people world wide can be on at the same time. I watch it after work and at night and it keeps crashing but rarely crashes of I use it during my lunch break."
2020-09-15 02:12:38,A+!!!,5,@!b@n,False,"I love Disney+!! It has everything; you want National Geographic?They have it!! You wanna watch some classics from when you were a kid like ducktales? They have it, along with the reboot, so you can compare! But, I mostly got this for all the Star Wars stuff, ‘cause I’m a huge fan. And they have nearly every single show and movie, including the mandalorian, which stars the most adorable baby alien ever(gizmo never stood a chance), Baby Yoda!!!! Who doesn’t wanna watch him do cuteness all day! And now, they even have the X-men films that FOX made, along with the whole. entire. show. of. the. Simpsons!!!!!! A++ Disney!!!"
2020-05-31 23:36:01,Great content but......,5,tina maniee,False,"Some of the movies are censored for no reason. For example the animated beauty and the beast is missing a whole scene! It’s the scene where the enchanted objects clean the castle and sing the song “when we’re human again.” Why would an innocent movie like that be censored? I’m paying monthly for this app so that I can watch all my favorite Disney movies all in one place, but then chunks of movies are missing. If you can’t offer a complete and original content then I can watch all these movies online or buy the DVD’s. Please fix this problem as soon as possible."
2020-04-12 19:05:29,Amazing App,5,myhates10,False,This app is amazing. It has all the classics. I like that once you pay for it you get everything else free! When you are in a rush to get a movie it has a bunch of different categories to choose from including action/adventure movies. I also like that they actually update the app with what’s new. Since COVID-19 is out and when you want to watch a movie you can’t go to the movies to watch one but this app makes it possible so you can have fun while being at home. All in all this app is worth a 5 star to me. Keep up the good work . Thanks developers!
2020-02-02 14:37:27,I’m a little disappointed,3,Lalamoucho,False,"I was so exited for Disney plus, but then it was not what I expected. I was lead to think that everything Disney was on here even all the shows from companies they own, nope. They don’t even have all the Disney shows, they select what is on there. Also there are no rated R movies either so no Deadpool even though it’s Marvel. Lastly it’s pause/play  system is really finicky on my phone. I’m sometimes just randomly kicked out of watching a show which I do not enjoy. But, overall I have to give it a three stars because I have enjoyed watching the old tv shows that were available. I just wish there was more control in the hands of the consumer."
2019-12-01 06:01:46,Account Control Options,4,Kaylee🐝,False,I gave my disney+ password to my (at the time) boyfriend and now that we split i changed the password thinking it would log him out but it didn’t. i know on netflix they give an option to log all devices out of the account when the password is changed and i think that should be something highly considered. when logging into the account at a friends house or something we should be able to log them out since disney+ only allows 4 profiles to be made. it is important that account owners are aware of who is logged on and when they can log someone out.
2020-01-24 18:32:01,Great App,5,Mike  W,False,"Thank you for an easy to use app across multiple platforms. I truly appreciate being able to browse your movies and other content quietly and peacefully without those annoying auto-previews that Ne*fl** and Pr*** subject us to. I do like to watch a movie all the way through, credits and all, so would prefer not to have the viewing screen minimize at the end. 

I use your service on Apple TV, Roku, Firestick, Webos on LG television, iPhone app, Mac and Windows. The features and usability are fairly consistent across all these platforms. I am hopeful that you will add new content in the future."
2019-12-31 17:44:13,Disney+,5,Disney+ Lovers,False,"My family and I love Disney+!  My family has a short-attention span, so whenever or wherever, we can pull out our phones and with a touch of a button, we have the #1 rated app for entertainment at our fingertips.   Disney+ has been a huge blessing for us.  Me and my husband our able to watch movies from our childhood, and my kids have picked up on very appropriate, kid-friendly, and funny shows for their age groups.  Not to mention, you can stream from multiple devices all in one account.  Thank you for everything you’ve done for us!"
2019-11-30 06:40:10,HDMI adapter not working,4,BeanWritesReviews,False,"I’m enjoying the Disney+ content so far, I love having the option to watch all these movies whenever I want. That being said, it’s a real bummer that the HDMI adapter screen mirroring functionality doesn’t work. Often I’ll get audio going to the TV but no video. I have no problems with all of my other screen mirroring supported apps but for whatever reason it doesn’t work with Disney+. I wish it did as I have no other way to watch movies from the streaming service on my TV. I would recommend the service to anyone but the app’s lightning to HDMI adapter screen mirroring functionality doesn’t work well."
2019-11-21 03:39:35,Where was I?,4,Hogfan18,False,"I agree with others. The content is obviously awesome! I think it’s categorized well. Easy to navigate. But I really hope they add features like saving where you left off in a show/movie if you leave the app. I also hope they add the ability to see what you’ve watched, particularly in a series. My daughter likes Jessie. There are 4 seasons. One show will start right after the other, which is great. But the next day, when you go to that series, you have no idea where you left off or which ones you’ve already seen. Please get this remedied on the next update. It would make life so much easier!"
2019-11-27 01:52:52,Disney+,5,urffff,False,"I love Disney+, I’ve had ever since it came out! Now I do admit I think there should be more Disney series or more stuff that comes out more often. I generally love how Disney did this with Marvel, National Geographic, etc. I also love how people who don’t go to the movies a lot can just get Disney+ and watch all sorts of movies and short clips that they missed out on. Especially if it’s no longer in theaters... 

        My favorite series is from Disney and it was really disappointing that they didn’t have it. I hope they put more series, short clips, movies, etc. in Disney+. Overall Disney+ is AWESOME!"
2019-11-19 01:52:12,"A great app, but a small problem!",4,16283853739297272,False,"I have enjoyed watching some of my early childhood favorites such as suite life of Zack & Cody and Good luck Charlie. Although these great shows bring back a lot of nostalgia for me there is a small problem. If I shut off the electronic I’m watching these shows on off, then when I come back the show does not leave off where I had ended. Thus leaving me stranded upon a wide array of episodes not knowing where I had left off. I believe that this issue can be solved with one quick update. Although this small issue can be very frustrating I am very thankful for this app and the entertainment it brings!"
2019-11-18 01:49:41,Awesome! But needs a few tweaks....,4,StopAckinCrayCray,False,"Like most other reviews say, the content is top notch! Keep it coming! The apps for iOS & Roku (and others I am sure) need some more sections. Def need the app to remember where I was inside a given show if I pause and come back another day, but also needs to remember what was the last episode I watched of any series so I don’t have to work it out each time. Also need a “what’s new” section so we know when new episodes of series (ie; Mandalorian, J Goldblum, Forky, Imagineering, Pixar in life). Maybe as someone else mentioned a “Continue watching” section?  Keep up the good work and keep that old content coming! Thank you"
2019-11-17 18:08:11,Amazing!,4,Shhon3y,False,"Disney + has so much amazing content on there however, like one of the reviews mentioned. It doesn’t have a “Continue watching” or “Currently watching” section which is a bit annoying because you have to go back to either the search menu or to your watch list to find the show or movie you were watching. It does pick up where you left off once you find it though. 

 Disney+’s original show The Mandalorian is such an amazing, fresh, exciting, and different show that really sets the bar for Disney+ original shows.

Over all the app and its contents are great! I recommend it hands down!"
2019-11-17 15:29:20,Great App - But Missing Element,4,Genesis716,False,"The app is obviously amazing if you are a Disney fan. Great movies and such. I know there are some current infringements on some titles due to contracts with other streams and will be late to release, which is fine. 

However, unlike other streaming apps, this currently does not offer “Currently Watching” or “Continue where left off” for the iOS system. This is super frustrating especially when I’m streaming from my phone and have to close out due to something happening and then attempting to return to the title. So frustrating... I know with feedback, this is something I am sure you will implement."
2020-07-20 21:18:38,Great App! Some Adjustments Needed Though.,4,Disney/Brodway Lover,False,This app is really good they have all my favorite shows and movies there are just some things that need fixed. I love the app don’t get me wrong but if I watch it on my phone then it will cut out part of the screen so I can’t see the captions and so I can’t see most of the scene. I have also been waiting for this one movie to come on and they said that it would be on Disney+ July 17 and it still is not on there. I have checked everyday multiple times but have still not been able to find it. Otherwise it is an amazing app and I really do use much more then Netflix.
2019-11-14 03:31:37,Amazing but one slight inconvenience..,5,Ejbeaz,False,"I was super hyped for Disney Plus and it didn’t disappoint. I got it the day after launch to try to avoid bugs and glitches and it has worked totally fine for me. It has all the content I could ask for. There is one problem— I wish it would be able to stream on a 2015 LG tv. It only is available for the 2016 models and higher. I got it on my Xbox, so I can still watch it on the TV, so I’m happy. Just a little annoyed that I would have to go buy a roku stick or something if I wanted to be able to watch it from the tv itself."

2020-08-10 02:51:24,Why Disney+ is the best,5,Fortnite please let me get in,False,Disney+ is at 60% of being more popular than prime video the only way they could get to 100% of being the most popular tv app in the world is if they get is if they put in the loud house  in there app in unrelated news prime video is the least popular tv app  in the world. It’s more  ore of an app you buy stuff on anyway prime video has a pretty low bar there bar is at 10% that is pretty low but at least it isn’t at 2% unlike kodi but who cares about kodi everybody is mainly focused on Disney+ and prime video.

I use it all the time to watch content I love! And also, the app works great! It is never laggy, and it’s very intuitive so it makes the experience of watching what you want a breeze which is very important for a streaming service. Also works great on all platforms! I like watching on my computer, but it works just as well on my iPad or Phone if that’s what I want to watch on. Great job Disney!"

This app is very easy to work around but does have some minor things that I would change. First of all is that there is a thing going around that people can hack into your account and steel your money. If I were Disney I would definitely fix this. And last but not least is that one of my favorite childhood shows A.N.T farm isn’t on there. I don’t know if it’s just something Disney forgot or if they just haven’t added it yet, but I’m kinda getting impatient. Overall this app is great it just needs some fixes!"

2020-02-01 19:25:41,So far so good,4,Jonathon ww,False,"So far I am not seeing the issues the people have been complaining of.

My only complaints are:
Better categorization with the option to view more movies/shows

Better searching 

As for these two, it’s frustrating to not be able to find a movie that is available until you see it as a recommendation from another one. Even searching for the title will yield nothing, but there it is as a recommendation.

Other than that, I’m disappointed that the list of movies/shows isn’t more robust. There are many films not released on here yet (Like Song of the South? We can keep Splash Mountain in the theme parks but not place the movie in queue so people can make their own decisions about this movie?) Not to mention some movies that are searchable but won’t be available for another three years? Like the original Adventures in Babysitting?

Other than that, it’s been surprising to go through the current list and discover movies that I didn’t realize were Disney releases."
2020-01-04 15:13:02,Over playing,4,jginsburg27,False,"Love this app however we are constantly having issues with the app overplaying in the background. For example you go to open the app and it automatically starts playing whatever you were last watching in the background, you can view it you can’t see it, it’s only the sound. If you try to put on another movie or show or even click on the same show it then plays both shows, the original with only sound and the second with viewing and sound. Super frustrating, it will stay like this for days. So you can’t use the app at all"
2020-01-25 00:33:27,Age Issue,5,Mina&Jared<3,False,"I love this app so much. It’s great to be able to go and watch all of the disney classics and rewatch all of the MCU movies, but there’s one really annoying issue. 

My brother and I share an account and we are both unable to use the account because he’s a minor. Why can’t 17 year olds use Disney plus? There’s nothing that minors shouldn’t see on this app...it’s literally disney. I’m disappointed that we’ve been barred from this account just because we’re under 18.  

Why even let us sign up if you’re just going to keep us from using the app later on?"
2019-11-25 14:58:59,Will be great with a few fixes and additions.,4,ZK1226,False,"The content overall is great! A few more old shows/movies could be added, but I’m sure that will happen. 

One inconvenience is the absence of a continue watching/resume option. They could also add “watch again” and “because you watched ___” sections. Another inconvenience is that I cannot even log into my account while I am at school unless I use my mobile data (I am a college student). Obviously, I cannot do this on my Tv or my computer. 

Other than that, I am pleased. I just hope the login errors get fixed and that I can stream on campus wifi again."

I love this app because I grew up watching Disney movies, Disney cartoons, Disney shorts, and Pixar films! My family is addicted (just like me!), and my mom got me into old Disney shows like Hannah Montana, and Lizzie Mcguire! I think this app is 100% appropriate, and great for a family movie night! Theres nothing that needs to be changed at all! It's perfect! Also, if you have verizon, you get Disney+ free for a whole year! What a great deal! Well now I'm bored and I might catch up on the Raven's Home series. Lights, camera, Disney+!"
2019-11-18 06:34:26,I will always love Disney no matter my age!,4,adamari.xo,False,When I first heard about the Disney plus app i was so excited! I will always be a Disney fan as long as i live ! The ONLY negative thing i do have to say about the app is that it does not have a “continue watching” option. I work 6 days a week so it’s hard to watch full episodes at once or definitely even a full movie. its just a little disappointing that when I squeeze in my disney time i either have to remember or write down what episode and how far along i was on the tv show. As well as how far along i was into the movie. Other than that I genuinely do enjoy Disney plus <3
2019-11-18 12:41:26,The amount of stupidity in the reviews is absurd,5,someguyperson5,False,"Most of the bad reviews are from tech illiterate people who can’t figure out how to log in, mad that they have to pay for it (it’s $7 a month people come on), or mad because their phones are too old and out of date to use it, and half of the people leaving bad reviews can’t even spell properly. This app needs the “continue watching” feature and the ability to start a previously watched episode from the beginning. Other than that it’s great and works amazingly. Thanks Disney!"
2019-11-17 03:36:06,Minor changes!,4,nvrv,False,"Love this app and it’s content! Would just love, like everyone else is suggesting is a “Continue Watching” area in the app, so shows that i watch and don’t finish can automatically appear in the app. Also for movies & episodes for shows to have an indicator or marker as to where i left off. I can’t tell what episodes i’ve already watched off of the title alone sometimes. (A bit disappointed at the fact that older animation shows from 2006+ aren’t included in the app yet. like Brandy and Mr. Whiskers, American Dragon: Jake Long, The Buzz on Maggie, Dave the Barbarian, and even Fish Hooks. But i’m hopeful that they will be included sooner or later)."

It’s how you don’t have a currently watching option when you sign on. And instead you have to find the show or movie again and hope it’s in your watchlist. I don’t know about anyone else but I like to just watch things and give them a try and sometimes I don’t add them to my watchlist and then I have to find them again. But all in all I love the app!

2019-11-15 16:57:30,Great selection needs work on resolution,4,jnives,False,"Love this app first of all. But definitely need some tweaks. Does not seem to save where you have left off on movies or shows so if you have to turn it off for any reason then you May have to start the movie or show over. 
My biggest complaint is the resolution on some of the movies and show. Like “Toy Story” “Frozen” and a few other. The colors are very dull and dim. Not anything like what it should Look  like. Even after changing the resolution on my tv to dynamic it still in not right. Almost pastel looking. If that would be fixed then o would have no complaints. Great app overall."
2019-11-14 06:27:18,Love the app!,4,Xionessa,False,"Honestly, I love it. Only downside is that the mobile app is very much different compared to streaming on my Xbox in terms of use. For example, it would be nice to have like a pop-up menu bar where someone can get to their Watchlist faster or target seeing Movies or Series. Something to add in general would be like a ‘Continue to Watch’ category on the home screen. That would make it so much easier to find what I last watched.

I totally understand that Disney+ just launched and, there’s always some kinks to work out in the beginning. I’m just really glad that it’s here and I’m looking forward to see what unfolds!"

I know that Disney said that they would fix this problem in early 2020 but it is early 2020 and in March. I would like to see a update for the app soon for this and other problems. Most People came to Disney+ for the Simpsons (or the Mandalorian) but I know that most people and I are disappointed about this I just hope you fix it soon or when you make Disney+ in the uk please give me a response to this please and if you do thank you

I’d rather be able to see a date sorted list of items that are on their way to the library. The other thing, is that there are several Disney series that are available on the platform, but not all of their seasons are available - I understand newer Disney original series going week to week, and I’m all for that (I hate binging). However, I’d like have access to all seasons of, for instance, the original 90’s Duck Tales, and they only have Season 1."

It will be so fun I love some of the shows I already looked at the you know like the stuff that like you know where you can buy it I already looked at it and it looks so amazing! I already watched a few shows and it’s like mine blowing that is why I am giving this five points like you know five stars and I’m so excited for to watch a lot more I watch so many already like I got this up actually like about yesterday but it’s OK I still really really like it!

It really does have a ton of shows that are from Disney or companies from Disney, but there is a flaw. Today I searched for some old Disney shows that I remembered, but they weren’t there. This happened with 2 Disney XD shows, Mech-X4 and Mighty Med, also with some other Disney shows such as Dog with a Blog. I know that both Dog with a blog and Mighty Med were really old Disney shows, but older ones than those can be found on Disney plus. If there is a reason why these shows aren’t on Disney plus, please let me know, but if there isn’t, can you please add them?"

Once I’ve finished a movie or show, it will not leave my Continue Watching list. I’ve tried everything to get them off and they just won’t. It’s really frustrating and it’s getting crowded. Makes it harder to actually find the shows and movies I’m  still trying to watch. This actually almost makes me want to get rid of this because of how frustrating and difficult it is being.

I love the shows, and the unbridled access to things we haven’t had all in one location before. However, I don’t like that in order to continue watching a show I have to hunt it down. And after finding the show I then have to find the episode I’m on. I also don’t like that there is no indication of what has and hasn’t been watched. Otherwise I’m in love with Disney plus. Just makes it harder to watch full series of something."

I’m not sure if there is any way to even fix this or help but I know I’m not the only one who is suffering out here with it just staring me in the face every time I open my phone... if anyone reads this thank you for taking the time I hope something can be done
2019-11-16 04:48:23,Essential if you have Apple TV,4,rcmustain,False,"After watching Mandalorian On Apple TV I decided I wanted to rewatch with my kids. The problem was that there was no way to rewind the episode, and even after letting the credits roll all the way to the end, selecting the episode would just start it with 14 seconds remaining. Siri wouldn’t rewind it. Using the Apple remote wouldn’t rewind it. There is no option for “start from the beginning” on the Apple TV Disney+ app. 

Fortunately, I recalled that I had started watching a movie on my phone and the Apple TV app picked it up where I left off on my phone. I was able to open the show on my phone, restart it there, and it restarted it on the Apple TV. Yay.

Now if only either app had a “now watching” or “resume watching” list, a playlist, or some other ease of use features that are standard on other streaming apps - yes, even at launch. 

As far as Disney+ is concerned, it is absolutely worth it. The selections are great, and right now Mandalorian is worth the price of admission alone."
2019-11-20 17:39:53,"Beautiful App, Great Content, terrible UX",3,Beaux2012,False,"It's a given that Disney produces quality. The content is exceptional. The visual design of the app is impeccable. The biggest issue is with the user experience.

On mobile:
You're unable to access the scrubbing bar to proceed to a given point without having to battle the 10 seconds forward or backward function for far too long. A simple tap on the lower 1/4 of the screen should make it visible.

On all platforms
There's no easily found ""continue watching"" or ""watch again"" section that allows you to resume a series/movie you've started without having to search it again. On Apple TV that's rather annoying.
When watching a series again you have to manually rewind each episode, which is exceptionally annoying on mobile. The app continues at the auto skip point each episode rather than starting over at the beginning.
When you run into an episode you're not interested in a simple ""next episode"" function would be much easier than having to go back to all episodes."
2019-11-13 23:39:12,Lots of potential,4,Chrysander321,False,"I tried the app and I fell in love with it. It had all of my favorite Disney shows and movies in one app. When I started using it a little bit more, I noticed how the show I would be watching would constantly need to load even though I had a really strong internet connection. I also noticed how when I would finish watching a specific episode, there was no way to tell I had already watched it. It would’ve been helpful if it had some sort of way of telling you that it was already watched. Overall, however, I am excited to see the app grow and fix these minor errors."
2019-11-16 01:24:22,Love it,5,Bid79,False,"So I don’t normal right a review for no app. But this app I love love love love love it!! There are so many old movies and tv shows I grew up with. Back in 1987 and on, I have looked and looked for the move that I watch in elementary school, and the book I read. WILLOW, they have it on Disney plus. OMG I CANT BELIEVE IT!! Thank you so so much Disney, for bring back a movie I loved as child. Please keep bringing new content too it. Any think this is not worth the 6.99 After the free 7 day trial. You going too end up keeping it. I have gotten rid off a few other app. All I need is my Disney plus App. Thank you so much"
2019-11-13 12:06:46,Netflix.,4,robimay,False,"Does anyone else notice how it’s set up a lot like Netflix? I love everything on it, but you can’t really see everything on it either, unless you know it’s there, just like Netflix. The only difference I found, is the fact it doesn’t have a continue watch section, where it saves your progress in a show/ movie and lets you access it quickly. I love Disney, and all the shows on it, but it’s sometimes a hassle when you want to watch an extra 5 minutes of your show as you get ready, but instead spend the five minutes looking for the show, episode, and place you’re at."
2020-07-15 05:09:03,"Great app, but one minor issue I’m starting to notice",4,Miguel the Stone Jaguar Slayer,False,"It’s a great streaming service overall, but there’s one thing that’s been bugging me, regarding the aspect ratio of certain films. For some reason, some of the movies I’ve watched on the app tend to zoom in out of nowhere, and I don’t know how it happened, nor do I know how to fix it. Doesn’t say how to fix it in the settings of the app itself, or even in the phone settings. Reset the app, nothing worked. Shut off my phone, didn’t work. None of those methods worked, so if this is a minor glitch that’ll be fixed in a future update, then that’s fine."
2020-09-22 18:14:41,Virtual Queues are terrible,2,skipsizemore,False,"Virtual queues sound great but are actually awful. Four of us continually reloading the queue page right on time failed to get a reservation twice in one day. It would be better to let the people who really want to ride stand in line than making us punch useless buttons like monkeys only to be told that the incredibly high price we paid to enter this park was insufficient to secure even the right to stand in line for an hour or two for a ride. 

The help also needs work. Many obvious questions are not answered, such as how to link my ios app to my bracelet when my wife bought the tickets. I had to send a help email for which I still have not received a response.

Not up to Disney standards."
2020-03-27 06:22:12,💕💕💕💕,4,booklover07072006,False,"I absolutely love Disney plus. I use it all the time. I watch it in my room by my self. I watch it with my family. I watch it with my friends. I watch it everywhere I go. One thing that disappointed me was that on Friday when the shows come out, they don’t come out right when it’s 12:00. Me and my best friend stayed up on Thursday night so we could watch our favorite, High School Musical: The Musical: The Series, but when the clock turned 12 we went straight to Disney plus. We were disappointed when we saw that no new episode was out. But other than that Disney plus is amazing and worth the money."

I have to turn off my home internet to watch a full movie without buffering or interruptions. I am really considering deleting the app once my free trial has expired. Please send me a number or offer me suggestions on what to do to fix the problem. I was really hoping on doing movie time with this with my family."

Then I searched up boy meets world, to just see if I could change the seasons, but It won’t pop up! I missed an entire season of them going to college, mr feeny retiring, topanga proposing to Cory, and them having a baby! I even tried clicking on the series name of the recently watched list, and it shows me a blank blue screen!  I thought y’all deleted it, but how could I watch it if y’all deleted it?

2019-11-16 16:13:53,"Obviously life-changing, but...",4,bigk074,False,"Don’t change a thing about what people say is great about this app. The options, colors, controls, graphics, easy-to-use user interface, etc is fantastic. That being said, Disney Plus really needs a “Continue Watching” section, as people have said. Also, it would be nice to pause a show or movie and be able to resume watching where you left off after closing the app. Much like the other streaming services, we should be able to resume where we left off. Also, it would be cool to have the option to sort our “Watchlist” into sections...I have spoken."
2020-02-06 06:38:48,give us some new updates. hate the interface.,3,jkatrina90,False,"the app is buggy. when casting a show on tv, It buffers at least 2-3 times during an episode. Finding where you left off in a show is complicated. It often starts the episode all over again, instead of going to the part i left off. Wanting to pause or rewind the episode is another issue. sometimes i can’t even pause it right away because I have to exit the app re open it, let it load and then the pause button eventually pops up. By that time i have to rewind then pause. I love the shows they offer on disney plus, and the movies. i just hate the interface. hate it."
2020-01-03 13:47:11,Kids able to delete all with no recovery,1,JenL12345,False,"We spent hours downloading Disney movies for a 15 hour international flight. Somehow, the app, which I’m willing to bet is used 99% by kids, has an option to delete all downloads with no recovery option without the requirement to even enter a passcode. So now we have a 15 hour return flight and we are unable to redownload movies since Disney Plus is not available internationally where we are vacationing. An app focused primarily on young kids as a target audience should have some safeguards so a 4 YEAR OLD CHILD is not able to delete all with a single button. If the app developers trust my kid so much, I recommend they include an option for my 4 year old to empty their bank account with a single button and no option to undo the action."
2019-11-17 23:47:16,Enjoy using the app but needs some features down the line.,5,ol ALEXKING lo,False,"I really enjoy using this app! The layout of it is good, easy to navigate and also like how they sorted some of the categories. I haven’t had any issues with playing any episodes, but I just have two complaints that should’ve been in the app since launch. Why doesn’t this app have a “continue watching” feature like Netflix does? It’s really annoying having to look up the show you’re currently watching and select the current episode you’re currently on."
2019-11-16 14:58:25,Great But Not Really,4,Longn000,False,"I love Disney+ it’s really good because it has my favorite movies but I don’t know if this happens to anyone else but whenever I download something and I just delete disney+ from my history I guess, I come back and they are gone
Which makes me really upset 
And also I skip a lot and when I do it won’t let me skip or just click off the movie then I turn off my phone and it keeps playing which is normal but then I click the pause button and it still keeps playing then my phone just lags. Then I go back to Disney+ to turn it off again and it just closes the whole app."
2019-11-15 15:29:29,Disney+ is awesome!,4,Codeman644,False,"I only have two things.
1) a continue watching feature would be really really nice!

2) *and this is more of a preference* I love how a lot of movies have BTS content in the extras tab. That was a pleasant surprise. I also love how seemingly all the Disney and Pixar Shorts are available! However, I wish they would put the short under the movie it was released with. Like “Mike’s New Car” and “For the Birds” with “Monsters Inc”. Not even exclusively with the movie. Just linked to it, so you can watch the short independently if you so choose. Even listing the short(s) released with the movie in the info tab. That would be incredible."
2019-11-13 17:12:58,Download keep disappearing???,4,Tvosges,False,"This is gonna be a great app, just 2 things I have issues with, 1 I’ve downloaded 3 movies and they keep disappearing. This is my 3rd time downloading them. I’m not sure if they’re only good for 24 hours or not??? It takes a very long time to get them downloaded also, but this I think will improve over time. 
The 2nd thing is, I don’t see they have a ‘continue’ watching. I think that should be at the top of the app, so it’s easier to just jump back in and finish watching. 
Those 2 little things are the only ‘issues’ I have. I just think it would make it more convenient."
2019-11-14 18:32:53,Super excited,5,A83677,False,"This app is amazing and I’m so thankful that you guys came out with it. My whole entire childhood is on here basically. I’m definitely gonna be binge watching everything lol. 7$ a month is totally worth it. Netflix is cool but they make you pay more to let you watch on several screens vs Disney+ they give you 4 screens to watch at the same time.

Although you guys need to fix a few things, such as a currently watched option. Having to find the show/movie I was watching before is a bummer. You need a “Play from the beginning” as well."
2020-10-13 22:43:35,Only one complaint,4,Charlie Sacco,False,The only complaint I have is that a lot of music on the soundtracks to shows and movies from before a certain year in the 2000s has been replaced by generic stock music. For example in the Picture Day episode of Lizzie McGuire This is the Story of The Girl was replaced by generic techno music that sounds completely out of place. Did disney lose the rights to the music or did they just feel like saving a buck by not getting them again if the licensing has expired? The major one that gets me is that Relating to a Pyschopath by Macy Gray was replaced by an upbeat jazz instrumental that completely ruins the mood of the scene
2020-08-22 18:33:22,I love Disney+ but here’s some thoughts.,4,Laura Avent,False,"Dear Disney+,

Me and my family love Disney+ but we don’t find a lot of our favorite childhood TV shows on there that are not on Netflix anymore. Like for example my 10 year old daughter was very disappointed when she was binge watching all of her favorite childhood movies and she didn’t see the Mickey Mouse Halloween movies or Christmas movies of all the of the short clips. She has loved those movies ever since she was 3. She also said that they we’re not on Netflix anymore so she didn’t have anywhere to watch them. Also my oldest would like to find some of his favorite childhood shows to."
2019-11-15 05:05:24,Currently Watching List,4,Mama2ASquish,False,"I agree with a lot of people. I need a currently watching list, where you can actually pick up where you left off. It’s frustrating when you have little kids and they want to continue watching the show but it keeps restarting every time you exit. This is also equally as frustrating for adults too. I would definitely prefer to pick up where I left off in my shows or even movies. The app is great over all and offers a lot of Disney shows and movies that we all grew up on. Now, I can show my kids and hopefully they’ll love it as much as I did growing up."
2020-04-24 01:45:09,Gravity Falls Glitch,3,Itsfunneh4lifw,False,"This app is great! All the classics! But there is an issue; and I don’t know if imm the only one with this issue. I’m calling it the Gravity Falls Glitch. I will click season 2 of Gravith Falls but it shows season one, while saying it’s in season 2. Eventually I was able to figure out how to watch season two episodes, which is skipping through the last season 1 episode and going through the episodes, but I cannot watch my FAVOURITE episodes! The finally! I loved those episodes, but they aren’t there! This doesn’t happen to my brother who uses it on iPad to! Please fix this!

2019-12-01 14:13:21,Bar far the worst built app I’ve seen in recent history,2,Kitty cat2,False,"This doesn’t even feel like a Disney Product! The app has any number of errors. Not only is there no “app” for older model AppleTV’s (Third Generation Model), there’s no way to add it which forces me to AirPlay content. This is wonky at best and constantly loses its connection. It get an “oh no” message as if they know it has problems but aren’t willing to do anything about it. I also cannot use my iPhone in any meaningful way while using AirPlay and streaming content from the app. The hierarchy always falls to what I’m currently doing on the phone and the app will not play in the background. How long did you have to work out the kinks? A couple years! This is the best you could do?"
2019-11-23 02:24:10,Highly Upset,1,Babyy.Christine,False,"I was so excited for the launch of this app and got it pretty much the day it was released. The app worked great for the first day and after that it had stoped working. It said it couldn’t connect and there was a problem with my connection, I uninstalled the app and reinstalled it to try and fix the problem. After that whenever I try to sign in now it won’t allow me too, and it tells me to call customer service. But whenever I do i sit on hold for an hour to and hour and a half and end up having to hangup because I have other things to do. I never was able to use my free trial, and I’m now being charged for the monthly subscription and it won’t let me sign into my account to unsubscribe from the app. I’m paying for something I can’t even use."
2019-11-16 06:17:22,I LOVE IT,5,Abbytoriano,False,"First of all, ahhhhhhhhhh!!! I’m freaking out! I love this! At first I wasn’t really thrilled for disney to make their own steaming service for some reasons, but putting that aside, my love for Disney and it’s shows made me subscribe. And let me tell you, I didn’t regret it! For the price, it’s worth every single penny. Just hopefully they don’t start raising the fee for it. Now for some few suggestions, I agree with a lit of people that have made them here already. Please add a “continue watching” option. And broader that suggested selection. Thanks! For now that’s all.. 
All my love, THANK YOU!!"
2019-11-13 00:56:43,Request an edit,4,csaurenman,False,"Want to start off with I absolutely love your product!! You have my favorite movies! But it doesn’t save your place in a movie or show, so trying to catch up on shows is challenging. The two  examples I have is I was cooking while watching, and was toggling between this app and Pinterest. Pinterest wasn’t working again so I closed all my apps, when I went back to Disney+ it was like I haven’t watched anything. And it happened on the TV I was watching a show eating was I was making and turned it off to go back to my phone and watch while doing dishes and it was like I was never there."
2019-11-15 00:56:41,Awesome app! Just a few issues,5,doglover2256,False,"I love everything about this app it has everything I love and more. The only thing I have a pretty big problem with is having no continue watching section that has all the shows you have been watching lately, this is a pretty big issue seeing has I don’t always have the time to watch all of the show or movie and it’s a pain to have to re-search for the show. Other than that I have no issues with the app it’s absolutely amazing and I love having every Disney movie at the tips of my fingers!"
2020-08-04 00:37:33,"Great Content, just one issue that bugs me",4,jusssssnat,False,"I really enjoy using this app. I adore the Disney content offered here and would highly recommend this to many of my friends and family. The one issue that bugs me is the screen. The films are usually wide screen, which for some reason fill in through my phone or TV and cannot see the full film and subtitles. If there would be an option to make the film wide screen to full screen(vise-versa as well), or simply fix the bug that it automatically turns full screen, I would greatly appreciate it and rate the app a full 5 stars"
2020-08-06 21:17:03,searching for movies and shows,3,Jaipurking,False,"I love all the shows and movies Disney plus has!! However, whenever I use the search bar, when it is not exact, it doesn’t show anything. Whenever I have a specific movie or show, I try to type it in. It never works because it is not exact. For example, Austin & Ally. I have to use that EXACT wording, not just austin and ally. Or if the movie is two words, I have to capitalize the second letter of the second word. Like come on son, just let me watch my movie without having to type it exactly. you could do a “do you mean:...” or just show what movies when I don’t use the correct capitalization or other things."
2020-01-07 00:25:15,NEEDS TO BE FIXED !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,4,julianborona,False,"I would give it 5 stars but It’s so annoying when I try to rewind and it gets stuck on the buffering thing like the movie or whatever will still play but I can’t press the rewind or fast forward button or the  pause button because it’s stuck on buffering and I get kicked out sometimes, also I have a great network connection but it still runs really really slow Sometimes, it’s ridiculous, but over all it’s amazing to have all the childhood memories come back with this new app so I recommend downloading it, even with all the bugs it’s worth it."
2020-06-23 02:15:56,Awesome app with some flaws.,5,Penguin dad,False,"Disney+ is an fantastic app, but with some flaws. It used to work with my Ipad’s keyboard, but now it doesn’t respond to it at all. I would like it if you could fix that. It would also be great if you could make it so the videos we watch don’t disappear after only three days of not watching it, and make My List able to hold everything we add to it instead of just a few. It would also be great if you could add Disney’s Dog with a Blog, that was one of my favorite shows to watch when it was on TV."
2020-05-15 03:19:05,Big flaw on disney. Be aware,5,Legggggggs,False,"Today I discovered a big flaw. Customer service was able to correct it. Someone hacked our account and changed the email and password. The issue is, when they changed it, my other devices still worked as usual not showing any indication of passwords or emails being changed. I feel they need to implement a 2 factor authentication. I do love the app however, due to this i will be showing 2 stars. Aside from that, 5 star. Now i have to cancel and start fresh. Work it cast members!!! Have a magical day"
2020-05-15 00:17:10,Not what I was expecting,3,Kong ok,False,I like watching Disney movies not totally a Disney fan but like watching them not sure if this would be the best app to watch all the Disney movies but it would be nice if they were a little more newer releases more often maybe if the price was a little bit lower it would possibly be a good price or have kids and maybe it would be more beneficial and having Disney+ definitely could do better with the app also it would’ve been nice to have a genre on the home screen to surf through the movies and TV shows a little bit easier it’s not totally user-friendly I think it could be better on that end as well

I try to talk to Disney support and they were not able to find my subscription. Called iTunes and they were not able to cancel my subscription or help me to log into any other devices 🤦🏻‍♀️but  I could watch movies on my phone. Then I tried to download movies and start AirPlay on my tv, it always says error. Sometimes I would watch movies on my phone and it says “error”. One of the most frustrating streaming app that I have ever paid🤬😡 do not Subscribe to Disney through ITunes! iTunes and Disney both got a problem with this app and I’m very disappointed."
2019-11-14 03:33:02,Kind of Dissapointment,4,L.Lexy.,False,"I purchased yet another streaming service but this time when I heard the name Disney it bought back memories and my childhood. I love that some movies like Gatta Kick It Up and True Confessions made the cut but I was really hoping to see everything in the Disney vault. Movies like Rogers and Hammers Cinderella and shows like Pepper Ane, that truly bought you back to the roots of Disney did not make the cut; and let’s all admit it’s truly heartbreaking. I hope they add everything soon and most of all keep as much as they can. This is the TV we grew up with and if they can offer us ticket into the Disney Vault then let us have it all."
2020-01-05 09:30:59,meh delorian,1,lukeydu,False,"Disney Minus is more like it. Minus the endless amount of time you will spend in live chats with support services that say, “be right back in 1 or 2 minutes” only to not respond again after staying in the chat for 30 minutes hoping for a response. 

The Mandalorian was good. But paying $69 to get hacked and forced to repeatedly explain the issue is a first world problem I’m not very interested in having. Two nights in a row were spent dealing with this and now we have supposedly had an “account takeover” that’s not a hack, according to your wonderful chat person. Even though they took time to lengthily explain that somehow passwords from old accounts were compromised and sold on the dark web. 

Ummm ok. That’s a hack. Don’t give me condescending PR BS please. Just help me resolve my issue. Thanks Disney!"

That show was the best and I expect the app to have like it says all the Disney movies and shows yet Netflix,Hulu,sling,and prime don’t have ant farm so I go to the Disney app thinking it has everything and what don’t you have ant farm and it’s not like a show that had one season and wasn’t a hit so if you would PLEASE CONSIDER adding a few more titles ant farm being included sorry but I gave up on punctuation ...  otherwise the app is good 👍🏽"
2019-12-01 21:26:52,Offline Download Disappointing,3,Smart Speller,False,"One of the major reasons we decided to subscribe to Disney+ was to use offline viewing of downloads when we are traveling.  We were disappointed during a recent vacation in Fiji that our son was not able to view the downloaded videos.  We got a message that Disney+ was not available in Fiji.   We didn’t expect to be able to stream there, but just wanted to watch the downloaded videos. We made sure that the iPad was completely disconnected from the internet, but it still didn’t allow viewing offline.   No problem doing the same with the Netflix app, but not with Disney+.  Disappointing!"
2019-11-13 23:15:50,😍😍😍😕,4,GRaq123,False,"It’s FANTASTIC!!! We have the app on all iPhones, our Samsung TV has the Disney+ app. As far as easy access to everywhere we need it I give it 5 stars! The app is gorgeous! Beautiful colors and layout. Easy to find stuff. I see several things missing I was sure would be on there. The new Aladdin movie for one. I’m sure it will all be on there eventually. MY BIGGEST COMPLAINT that I ask you PLEASE FIX ASAP is that it doesn’t save your spot like Netflix does!!! You have to go in and look up what you were watching and try and find where you left off!!! That’s a big 👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼 If it weren’t for that one thing I would rate it 5 stars."
2019-11-13 21:16:00,Ugh,1,Brttnylyn,False,Honestly don’t even want to go to Disneyland anymore I’m so frustrated with Disney plus 😂 but for real.. I’m on my second all day phone call with no one picking up. The app doesn’t work and they’re going to charge me when I can’t even use the app. At this point I just want to cancel my subscription but I can’t because they won’t pick up. If they wind up charging the people who can’t use the app nor get ahold of people to cancel I can see a huge lawsuit happening. And also if they KNEW that chrome cast wasn’t going to work they should have warned people. But also it won’t let you airplay so it’s just double bad on Disney. I was super excited for this so I’m pretty bummed. Wish it worked. But I’m pretty close to going full extreme psycho and banning Disney from my home 😂 so frustrated. Send help.
2019-11-13 20:05:29,Great Content but Need to Work on Features,4,Transformergirlgeek15,False,"Great Content. Missing some TV shows like House of Mouse, The Tarzan and Jane TV show - not the movie, but maybe they will phase those in after HD-ing them. 
I’m not sure if it is just me but I would like a “recently played” or “continue watching” list. I was watching Lady and the Tramp and was slightly put off by the fact the movie began from the beginning, not where I left off. So I had to scrub to where I was in the movie. Or a “resume” or “start over option” for films would be nice. Also an option to view scenes. Like a scene selection option rather than scrubbing the entire film."

(Cuz I like that movie 🤩) and I watched it. The next day IT WASNT THERE!!! Now I don’t know if this is a glitch. But I don’t understand why Disney plus only had a movie for ONE DAY. Please at least add Shazam back to Disney + also I have a request. Could you pleaseee add Black cauldron to Disney + I REALLY wanna watch it!!! I know your trying to hide this movie from the public but... could you add it...?😁

P.s please if you respond don’t take legal action against me for mentioning black cauldron.

2019-11-20 00:25:25,Nice!,4,RNBRTaken2,False,It has been really nice to watch movies that I loved to watch as a child!  My children have been enjoying as well.  One thing I don’t like is that we wanted to watch some of the newer movies and they are not available.  I guess I was hoping that if it were a Disney movie we would be able to watch it including the new remakes for example we wanted to watch beauty and the beast (2017) and it wasn’t  available.  Little disappointed because I thought there were going to be more movies then there seems to be. Maybe it’s more movie access then on my phone.  Idk.  But over all I like it!

The only problem is that while we are watching anything every few minutes it seems to freeze, the movie or show gets stuck on one image but the sound continues. It fixes itself after a few seconds but it happens very frequently. At first I thought it was my TV so i put it on a different one in another room and the same thing continues to happen."
2020-04-10 15:12:37,Where’s the representation?,5,Anjie.5,False,Now Disney+ is an amazing app as you can see I gave it a 5/5 but I’d just like to state to the public that there is little to no black reproduction. I am an African American women with a family and #1 there are only two black females and no males on the section of the app where you can pick your profile picture and #2 the fact that I know there are more than two African American characters that they can make an option of. I just think that Disney+ should add a bit more representation in there profile picture.
2020-03-12 00:16:42,No Capability to Select Seasons/Episodes,1,NoneDScript,False,"I would really appreciate the ability to see past, current, & future list of serial episodes. Currently there is no capability for that and it is a big disappointment; no matter what platform I’m on (phone, computer, or Roku-like device). For example, if you accidentally let the app auto play through the next episodes because you left your steaming device for a real would need, there is no way to go back to select any season and/or episode that I’ve found . If there is, then Disney+ should add a help menu with this info or update all apps. If not, Disney+ needs to add the capability soon. If this capability is not available soon then then Disney+ apps are all  handicapped and not worth using for serial entertainment.  Just saying."
2020-03-11 02:51:49,Needs an update desperately!,3,swimprincesa,False,"I like to cast streaming services to my tv from my iPhone and there is something wrong with several titles, and strangely they are all the “popular” titles. They don’t cast!!! They work perfectly fine in the app, but when I try to cast, the Disney logo and movie title show but it just sticks to buffering. It is not a problem with my chrome cast because other than this it works perfectly fine for other streaming services. More strangely, “less popular” titles on the Disney plus app can work on the app and can cast successfully. Why can I not cast everything?! I am currently on a trial and if this doesn’t get fixed, you can count me out."
2020-02-11 02:17:14,App is not mature,2,Ldmtwo,False,"Devs, please add a Feedback button so that we can guide you to fix all the terrible design/UX problems. Both the desktop and iOS app have some serious issues especially if you compare it against more mature apps of a similar function. I see that a few issues have been fixed, which is great. What hasn’t been fixed is the watchlist and an adequate way to stop and resume. I have a feature request. Please give us recommendations for age groupings. There are plenty of adults who have purchased the service. You can recommend engines/widgets at a personalized level instead of just individual films. Eg trending adults vs trending teens. Or co-view adults vs teens. I would align with the adult trends more than teenagers"
2020-01-03 01:23:18,Best movie app ever!!,5,AppReviewerprofessional!,False,"If your like us and just don’t have the money to buy movies you really want to see I highly suggest getting Disney plus. It’s free to download, all the movies on it are totally free, and all popular movies made by Disney or came out of the theater go directly on Disney plus for you and your family to enjoy!  One problem would be that if your tv is older then 2016 it will not work so I suggest getting it on a iPhone,iPad,or computer. This is the only problem when it comes to Disney plus otherwise it is totally awesome and amazing!!😍"
2019-11-26 04:55:46,Great but not the greatest. Disney fix this!.....,3,kendra wolf,False,"Yes, this app is great because it has all the movies & tv shows I grew up with and that makes me happy by the fact of watching them all over again but I think this app has a problem and it has to be fixed as soon as possible. I’m watching whatever series and suddenly the app closes and it’s terrible. I have to open the app again and search what I was watching and see it again ('cause idk why it repeats again) Overall I like Disney + a lot but I really think Disney has to fix this issue cuz it’s annoying most of the times. And if it’s not fixed I will have to cancel my membership. That’s all. Thanks."
2019-11-19 11:07:39,A little frustrated..,4,SJS51588,False,"Love this app EXCEPT for a few things that I REALLY hope they fix. Number One - A Currently Watching list. Every single time I go to watch Hannah Montana I have to GUESS where I left off because if you click on the main title it starts you at the BEGINNING OF THE SERIES AGAIN!!! Super frustrating. Issue Number Two - Movies and shows keep disappearing from my Watch List. I just tried to re add Frozen SIX TIMES. Every time I opened the app it was out of my Watch List queue again. 

Disney or whomever created this app. PLEASEEEEE fix these issues. I’ve been waiting a long time for this app along with millions of others."
2019-11-18 14:05:50,Just a few things,4,butterfinger0231,False,"I absolutely love this app! I have been dying to go back and watch the originals, and now I can! Only a few things that could be fixed though. First, as I have seen many people say this also, there’s no continue watching section. It is a little bit irritating to go and have to search for what you were watching last. Second, the most recent movies like Aladdin and the Lion King aren’t on there. Now I know, it’s probably because they’re fresh out of theaters and the amazing team is doing their best to get them on there. Other than those 2 things, this app is AMAZING!!!!!"
2019-11-17 17:12:36,I love it but,4,Rosario Taboada,False,"I love how I’m able to watch old shows and movies that came out when I was younger but when it comes to watching the tv shows, I don’t like how u have to look for the correct episode to continue watching. I would try to just hit play but it would just take me back to the first episode. I think it would be best if a continue watching list is add where it shows which ones your watching (obviously) and  where it allows u to continue watching where u left off instead of having to look for the episode u left off. I hope this made sense, but all in all I love the app."
2019-11-14 06:52:12,Not working,5,akunknown,False,"I was very excited about this app, me and my friend were going to go half and when i tried to log on all i get was ""we are having trouble connecting to your account"" and then eventually it said ""disney plus is not available in your region"" when people from my state, city, neighborhood are getting on perfectly fine. At some point i even tried my other friends account and it said the same thing. I understand its a new app and there are going to be glitches but please fix it as soon as possible"
2019-11-13 03:19:17,Great but...,5,Nelson Rd,False,"Works fine. Content is immense. 
-But, many titles you have to do a search for them to see them as an option. They aren’t actually listed anywhere.
-But, if you watch part of something and leave to do something else, like ... work, when you return there is no place holding what you were watching. You’ve got to search it out, again. Though the app does remember and will resume where you left off.
For now, that’s what I’ve noticed. 2 movie and 1 show down. Starting another movie to fall asleep to. ;-)"
2019-11-13 02:05:40,BETTER THAN EXPECTED,5,lizy12345678910,False,When my parents were getting this I could have cared less until they told me about all the shows and movies they have. They have almost every movie or show by Disney it owned by Disney. Also like the feature to download so you can watch on the go. The fact that it became #1 in entertainment on the App Store in less then 24 hours is amazing. For only 6.99 a month it is really great for all of the content you get on this platform. You also get a year free with Verizon. I would rate this 100 out of 5 stars if a could!
2019-11-12 14:23:11,Exactly what I was expecting,5,RuthyDeen,False,"I wanted to be able to play my Disney classics for my daughter with out breaking out the DVDs and with out switching from one streaming service to the next and that is exactly what Disney+ provided. Like a few other comments have said, I am having a problem with my watchlist, but this is minor to me and not at all worth giving a lower rating. Oh I would also like them to add more of the Disney Pixar shorts. I love the short films they show in theaters before a movie and having access to them all on this site would be excellent!"
2019-11-12 20:38:58,I was excited...now disappointed,1,NiLy7,False,"My family and I were really looking forward to this launch and paid for a year subscription. We have Vizio and Samsung TVs. The only way to get it on the Vizio is to SmartCast from my iPhone. So if I’m not home, my family can’t watch it. As for the Samsung, the app is only available on TVs from 2016 or newer. Mine is from 2014 and the app from my iPhone won’t let me use the screen mirror option for this TV.  I tried to use the Web Browser app on the Samsung, but the web page says “unsupported.” I also thought about running an HDMI cable from my laptop to the TV, but my laptop doesn’t have a plugin for that. This is very disappointing and seems like a rip-off. It seems like you can only use it with the latest and greatest tech gadgets."
2019-11-18 05:34:55,Love but annoyed,4,XCSMX,False,"I am absolutely in love with Disney +, it has all the shows and movies I want and it also shows trailers to coming soon movies and it is amazing, but it’s missing something. Something very very important, a “ continue watching” section!!! It’s very annoying have to search for your show and have to search more a guess what episode you’re on. So please please please Disney, in your next update please add a “currently watching” or “continue watching” or “keep watching” section! Please please please! I’m begging! Because I love love love this app and that missing piece is cutting it short from being perfect"
2020-06-13 06:52:56,Great app for all Disney needs from little kids to nostalgia nuts,5,Big chungus89,False,"I know I’m late but Disney plus is a great app with so many classics it’s great for family time and has even helped me bond with my family and kept me entertained for many hours there dose seem to be some shows missing but compare it to all the great stuff we have it’s far out way that complaint 
It’s great for nostalgia you can see all of your childhood favorites like Bambi, finding Nemo,
Snow White, and Cinderella. All in all a great time and a surprisingly good quality for how little you pay."
2020-01-04 19:45:10,Needs better parental controls,2,Jeepgirl79,False,"There needs to be profile specific, password protected parental controls. My 8 year old knows how to toggle on and off the button for the kids profile, so I can’t keep it safe for him. He has found the Simpson’s, and is pointing out inappropriate episodes where Bart is naked, or women are dressed inappropriately, and watching them over and over again. He is watching marvel movies that I’m not yet comfortable with him viewing at that level of violence. I monitor him, but when I walk away to do dishes, or take a shower, or clean up, he will go back into a show. I’m not happy that Disney plus has not taken care of this setting to make it safe and appropriate watching for our young, impressionable viewers."
2020-10-11 02:15:38,Always room for improvement 👍🏾,4,NaniDaBest,False,"I love Disney+ but I think there is always room for improvement. There is only two things I don’t like . One thing is the cast, so I was watching stargirl and I was wondering were the cast was? I mean the girl who sings has an amazing voice but I did not have her name or any body else’s. The second thing is Andy Mack. Andy Mack is one of my favorite shows but once I saw it on Disney plus there is only 2 episodes in the first season???? Like we’re da rest? Also it scramble up all the episodes so I can never find them. I do recommend this app for Disney fans but please read this."
2019-11-13 22:05:09,AMAZING!!!!!,5,Jazz2k16,False,"For starters, I haven’t written a review on anything in YEARS.!!! This was well deserved Disney, you guys truly deserved this. I have not seen so much of my childhood in one place for a very long time. Now I can show my two year old sister what I watched as a little girl. I literally cried because I was in such awe when I saw some of my old favs in this app.!!! My parents were totally shocked, they could not believe their own eyes.!! I am so excited to watch my favorite shows and movies again. I truly can not wait to get out of class!!! #stocked 
#disneyrocks #disneykidatheart"
2019-11-13 14:14:32,Fantastic,5,anything idontcarereally,False,"This app is doing great. Negative reviews talking about customer service or what sounds like, personal equipment issues. This app has ALL the Disney stuff!! I love this app! I don’t think I could watch everything they offer within the first year! This is awesome! And it’s available without paying for a cable subscription ($55+) 

Customer service will get better! It’s been a small number days since opening. Give Disney a break! Lol Customer service workers need constructive criticism too. 

The app is great! Works great! Picture is great! Movie list is fantastic!"
2020-06-30 17:38:10,Almost perfect but....,4,HopeLovePeaceNotWar,False,"Soooo I love this app and I think it’s amazing how there are no adds (which is very rare) and how there are so many options to choose from. I only have a fewww complaints. First, on many movies (like the live action Beauty and The Beast) we have to wait until October to watch it on Disney plus. I understand that this could be like that for many reasons, like copyright and such, but they are adding new movies and new tv shows, but we have to wait until October to watch something from 2016. But I love Disney and I always will, just could you address this please? 

Thanks so much"
2020-07-15 22:37:24,Great choices and extras as well.,5,DaleDe,False,"I really like this app. For those who buy DVDs to get the extras will like the fact that this app provides them as well. A good feature is it turns my watch into a remote control for pause and 10 second jumps. I use it via my html adapter on tv and it can also use my older Apple TV box, but only for the movies themselves, not the app display. Originally I had a problem with aspect ratios but it turned out to be a setting on my tv. Digging out my tv remote provided the fix. It was strange but not the apps fault."
2020-05-10 23:28:04,Really great! But...,4,BaxtyBoi,False,"I love this so much! I’ve watched a lot on here already and has a ton of shows for everyone. I think it just lacks a couple of options. Like they have collections of movies and shows, but there’s no way to save those unless you add each thing individually. Not a big deal but it would be nice to be able to just an “add collection button.” When I first got it I had some sound issues or screening issues like the screen would go black but the sound would continue, but I haven’t experienced that recently so I’m assuming that’s fixed. Really great though!"
2019-11-20 04:09:47,"Wonderful, but...",4,DME-Mad,False,"Love the availability of movies, TV series etc. But I do think we have room for improvement in the app itself. Unless IP is the issue take a few pointers from the Netflix app. Need not be identical but similar visual tweaks would be helpful; read on. 
First I agree with others that a “currently watching” section would be great. 
Second, why can I not visually tell which episodes I have watched or started from those I have yet to watch when looking at a list of episodes?  This is incredibly annoying. 
Third, where is the option to “Resume” vs “Start from beginning “ when revisiting a show/episode?
If I pre-screen a show and return later to watch with my children, it starts where I left off. On the AppleTV I need to Pause>flick-left all the way back to the left, then need to press “Play” in order to “start over” unfortunately half the time an error occurs which requires me to back out and try again. 

Cannot wait for the update."
2019-12-09 02:02:00,For Mando Only...,3,Oldboyla,False,"I have all of the MCU and Star Wars Blu ray / Digital collection, so except for a few shows - the only reason why I subscribe is mainly because of The Mandalorian. I watch Mando thru my iphone and airplay it on my smart TV (which is truly annoying) because Apple made sure that 3rd gen Apple users won’t get Disney+ app update we deserve. I hope Disney+ urges Apple to include the app on Apple TV 3rd generation. Also, like Netflix I hope Disney+ adds the check list feature after watching a certain episode so we would know if we have watched-it a show or episode already. So a check box is necessary. Lastly, Disney+ needs an autoplay to the next episode feature."
2019-12-07 11:03:09,🤩🤩🤩🤩,5,Emmie👁👄👁,False,"This is AMAZING I have no bad things about this app. I’ve always liked the Parent Trap (Lindsay Lohan) but every time we watched it we would rent it because it costed so much and we did not want to pay 20 dollars on the movie. But now we have it for free! Disney+ also gives you TV shows never seen before to anyone who does not have it, like the Mandalorian! It’s another reason to buy this. The Mandalorian is a great show and if you have Disney+ check it out!

Personally Disney+ is amazing!! But if it’s not for you don’t feel pressure to do it! 

~Emmie~"
2019-11-19 17:20:44,Missing something,4,redpanda602,False,"So far it’s been okay, the one thing I noticed that might improve the app is that at the moment it doesn’t keep track of the episode someone already watch. Adding something like that could help. And maybe getting a page that has information on up coming movies and shows that will be added to the app could help as well. Overall i like it. Though there’s so many to watch I don’t know where to start. Just found out Cinderella had third movie after watching it I feel like they should make a tv series about the original Cinderella"
2019-11-19 03:11:54,Currently or continue watching.,4,jjjjjaaaaaaaccccckk,False,"I completely agree with every five star rating about this app out there. This is an amazing opportunity and it is fantastic that this is an option. The one and only super super important change this app needs is a continue watching column. It is essential that Disney+ adds this feature. Every other streaming app and site has it and it would create a 100% awesome customer experience. This is the only, and I mean the only reason my review has 4 stars instead of the 5 five it would have if the continue watching feature was added."
2019-11-17 17:30:31,PLEASE UPDATE WITH A CONTINUE WATCHING LIST,4,mady36,False,"I absolutely love Disney + and have been waiting since the announcement date. I’m so so happy with the shocking amount of shows listed. But I’m really struggling without a “continue watching” list. Currently watching Wizards of Waverley Place and I have to try and remember which episode and minute I was on last and got so frustrated that I just started the whole episode over. Same thing happened when I was watching Inside Out earlier this week, I had to fast forward to where I last was. Please please please fix this soon! I know I’m not the only one with this complaint!"
2019-11-17 23:14:11,Love the content-but needs some fixes!,3,Kc1358,False,"My little one loves the Disney junior shorts, especially the little nursery rhymes. The first time you watch it does the normal streaming thing where the next “episode” automatically advances to the next one when the credits roll. BUT the problem is-if you go to watch them again-there is no option to play them from the beginning and they all start in the last 10 seconds of credits! So please fix that if there is less than 30 seconds left the default should be to start from the beginning!!! Also-I would love a currently watching or pick up where you left off feature."
2019-11-16 04:05:37,10 stars for the heart of it! Some functionality issues...,4,kizziesings,False,"This is indeed the greatest thing to happen in the streaming era.
Disney has not only fulfilled childhoods of today but childhoods of old. The nostalgia is almost TOO much!
The heart of this app deserves 10 stars.

There are just some functionality issues:
There’s no ‘currently watching’ or ‘resume’ feature. That’s the biggest and worst of this app’s shortcomings. Quite unbelievable, honestly.

When adding a movie to the Watchlist, the green check does not stay checked. I spent maybe an hour adding stuff and began thinking ‘didn’t I already add this??” I started to notice content I definitely added were not checked and thought I’d spent all that time for nothing. I checked my Watchlist and everything was there thank goodness, so it’s a small but significant error in the UI. It makes it hard for me to know what I’ve added and what I haven’t.

Still new to the app, but those are the three glaring fails of the app."
2019-11-16 05:09:11,App needs work,3,Potatoooe,False,"The app runs fine in a nutshell but there are small features or fixes that can make this app potentially better or even perfect. On the ipad, it just isn’t on par with Netflix’s small features and “perfections.” Disney+ app tends to close when the video is in “picture-in-picture” mode, although this is not recurring all the time. No “continue watching” or other easy and quick access to it on the menu page for videos/shows you want to continue if you had to take a break midway. An actual working “auto play next” episode would be nice. Just a lot of small things that could be worked on or incorporated."
2019-11-14 01:22:48,Love it! But so many glitches,4,WondererZer0,False,I love this app and expected there to be some glitches with the release. But I figured it would be a good idea to share them. First it was taking forever for things to load and things I added to my list were taking awhile to to show up. Then when I exited out it wouldn’t let me log back in. It tells me it’s having trouble connecting to my account and to reenter my account information and try again. Did that it’s still not working. I’m so very very excited for this and really hope that the bugs get fixed so that I can start enjoying it.
2019-11-12 13:45:17,Some movies and shows listed not playing..,2,KerseyA,False,"I have downloaded the app on both my iPhone and Fire Stick. On my phone it is not letting me create a new user profile for my kids it says there is a connection issue but my WiFi is intact. On the Fire Stick, when clicking MOST of the shows it does not give you an option to play them after you’ve clicked on the show, it just displays a screen saver of said show, also on certain movies it says media not available even though it right on the screen. I don’t think Disney quite thought through this release.... I would rate this app with more stars if the the show my kids wanted to watch were even able to play but they aren’t..."
2020-03-23 09:18:42,good but not complete!,4,mkl147,False,"First of all, I LOVE this app- such a good idea. However it is still missing many shows and movies such as ANT Farm, 16 Wishes, and Dog with a blog. Where are they at?! Another slight complaint is when i’m watching on my computer and i’m finnished watching a movie, I have to watch all the ending credits so the move can exit my continue watching. I tried just forwarding it but still doesn’t work. I would like it to be able to return to the home page before the end credits without the show still under the continue watching section. But over all such an amazing app!!"
2020-09-06 01:01:45,I love this app,5,Dollygon,False,"I love this so much I watched a load of stuff on here like the one and only Ivan ,jack ,the suite life of Zack and Cody(ps when this show started I was born)Hamilton and etc.  But I really want to watch new stuff on Disney + like spider man or more marvel movies I also think since you made this app  it  would be cooler if you made another app with Nickelodeon on it if u do this I will be so happy also if I had enough I would donate your company I just have to get my money out but first I’ll ask my mom or dad maybe I’ll donate you today!! I love this apppppp!!!"
2020-09-05 03:45:10,Love it! But.....,5,Kurtm93,False,"On the PS4 we have issues streaming shows and movies. We will start a show and the screen will freeze with the audio continuing. Then the loading circle will pop up, and the start back where the video froze. Sometimes on the PS4 the show will jump ahead like 10 seconds. The audio will jump ahead 10 seconds and the video will follow looking like we were fast forwarding. Other than that I still use this more than any other streaming app because of the content."
2020-05-15 04:46:43,Good job Disney+,5,maryohuna,False,I love Disney+ because I get to watch shows that I’ve never got to watch before and you don’t have to be patient when the ads play in the middle of the episode you are watching and It is less confusing trying to make an account on Disney+ then other tv shows and movie networks and you don’t have to unlock episodes like you do on DisneyNOW and disney+ have all the episodes of the seasons on a show and a bunch of exciting releases I’m so happy Disney+ exists and I cannot wait for more releases in the future bye
2020-04-07 06:44:49,Add the Quality Shows Please,1,person who is unknown,False,"I personally wanted Disney + for the movies and a few shows that I enjoy. When I opened the app I was intending on watching movies and my 3 favorite shows, the trifecta of perfect television Mighty Med, Lab Elite Force, Lab rats. I personally can’t sit through any movie because of my lack of attention span, so I was excited to binge watch my favorite shows. My quarantine dream was to
 immerse myself in the cinematic perfection that is Disney XD, imagine my dismay when I found out that Mighty Med was not on Disney +. Mighty was my personal favorite out of the perfect trio. I cannot watch Lab Rats Elite Force with out BOTH of its riveting sequels. I cannot rate this app anything higher than 1 star without the full trifecta of perfect television. Please answer my demands and the four other stars with come shortly."
2019-11-21 03:59:54,Just a couple ideas,4,SittinPrettyInTheSaddle,False,I LOVE Disney+ but there are things I hate about it also. I hate that it doesn’t have auto play so I don’t have to unlock my iPad and reconnect to continue streaming to my Apple Box. I also hate that it doesn’t have a “continue watching” feature so I have to remember what season and episode we are on with every series we watch. And if they added Nickelodeon programs too it would be 100% and I could cancel all my other subscriptions. These three things would improve the quality of Disney+ and bring even more customers in. Overall 7.5/10.
2019-12-15 18:57:52,Horrible Customer Service,2,ElleDEX,False,"I’ve had several issues with the app; however, the 2 star rating is because of the customer service received. I purchased during cyber Monday deal and I did not receive the discounted amount. That is false advertisement. I called and was on hold for about 30 minutes. While on hold, I hear a message that they are not able to take my call because of technical difficulties. I called a 2nd time and after 15 minutes, my phone disconnected. I then went online to web chat with a customer service rep. They told me that I have to pay full price because of the free trial even though I purchased the yearly subscription during cyber Monday sale.  Shame on you."
2019-12-06 13:08:07,Billing issues,3,Leannejan,False,"Signed up for Disney+ app and while I was signing up, it asked for a credit card number. Then, I see I was charged twice, once with my bank account associated with my ApplePay and once on the cc it asked me for during sign up. Contacted Disney+ and they said that I needed to contact Apple. When I called the number for Apple, I received an automated response that did not resolve the issue. I called Disney again and they said that they had no way of seeing how I paid. Now I am in a dispute with my CC company trying to get my money back and make sure that I am not stuck with a recurring fee both on my bank account and my CC. Super frustrating!!!!"
2019-11-17 22:22:47,Amazing but...,4,Ufcjfdbkddssegnk,False,"There’s only two issues I’ve come across:
1. Recently watched listed, but I think many people have mentioned this. 
And 2. On the tv version I went through and selected all the movies and shows I want to watch later, on the app version (yes same account) I can not find that list at all. Plus once you add a movie normally the + will turn into a ✅ and no matter how many times you come across that movie it should still have a ✅ so you know you already added it right? Disney plus doesn’t do that. It always has a + so I keep forgetting I’ve already added it"

I am so tired right now and I just wanted to watch Austin and ally cause it was my favorite show ever but it wasn’t there! (not gonna lie, started tearing up). So I kept searching and found that the proud family, enchanted, sky high, sunny with a chance, and a lot of other classic shows/movies. It’s just a suggestion and I really hope to see it soon. Okay, got to go watch Halloween town!!"
2019-11-17 16:35:51,Great Service but App Needs Work,4,ElGreco1541,False,"I love the content that is on this app. As far as content goes this is already my favorite streaming service. So many things that I actually want to watch. 

When it comes to the app, it needs work, which is not to be unexpected at this early stage. They need to add a currently watching section to the home screen. Search needs a huge upgrade. Lastly, they need to improve the syncing between devices. I’ve switched devices mid-movie and had to find where I was at, it wasn’t automatic. This happened several times. 

Overall I love it so far though!!"
2019-11-16 00:17:37,Love it!,4,ehudson02,False,"Overall, I really enjoy and love Disney+. I think that it is so awesome that all of the old shows are back. I have been wanting to rewatch so many of these movies and series, and now I can!  
There is one that that I would like to suggest for them to fix. I would love for when I am watching a series for it to be included in a continue watching list. I would also like for my progress in a series to be saved. I don’t like that I have to go through ever episode to figure out which one I am on. (This reason is why it is only 4 stars.)
I am so glad that Disney came out with this!  It is so amazing!!"
2019-11-15 04:51:17,"Love it but,,,,",4,Mads Beck,False,"I love Disney+ it is an amazing streaming service all except for not having a continue watching. i cant always watch a whole movie at one time, and remembering what episode i left off on is a difficult task. a ‘continue watching’ would make this review go to 5 stars! i love all the movies and shows! i also think they should have it a little more organized. ‘Disney Princess’ section ‘DCOM’ section ‘Live Action’ sections, etc. with all those movies/shows in those categories. i understand its brand new and has some kinks to work out but definitely needs a continue watching section!"
2019-11-14 00:12:52,Pretty good,4,Momof1stepmomof3,False,"Ok so I love it for the most part. I read a review saying they couldn’t watch it on their tv, but it must be an older tv bc I got it just fine on both my tv’s app stores.. that being said, the only complaint I have is that when I start watching something I can’t pick back up where I left off. As another person said I’m sure this will get resolved at some point, it’s literally the first day! My son is super excited for all the movies! We did try to find the air bud movies which aren’t all there yet, but I’m sure they will add more in the future. Can’t wait to watch all the movies!!!"
2019-11-13 17:40:29,Just Needs Some Tweaking,4,Bharger,False,"The content is Fantastic but needs some tweaking to the interface. When you are watching something it only allows Pause/Play, FFWD/Rewind. There should be options for some type of chapter selection, when fast forwarding or rewinding it should show a picture of the scene it will be on and closed captioning. There should be an option to turn this on or off and to have it where certain profiles can choose to use this and others not to based on their preference. Also it would be good to be able to organize your Watchlist."

2019-11-13 03:45:49,Wow just wow,5,christy_g07,False,I’ve been waiting for this app my whole life and didn’t even realize this is what I wanted. As a DDH I was worried that it was some how going to be a few updates before it started running smoothly but it has been a total dream. Easy layout and 100% family friendly. People complaining that there isn’t enough ‘original content’ must not remember other streaming sites beginnings. There is sooo much too watch that by the time Disney+ starts pushing more content we’ll still need more time just to get through the vault.
2019-11-12 07:52:09,Impressive Launch,5,Rightbrotha,False,For the launch of a new service I am very impressed with the effort that was put into the design of the app and how well it performs even with the launch traffic hype. This service is jam packed with content for every age group and in my opinion is the new best overall streaming service. I will say there have been a few minor issues like my watchlist not loading properly but I am sure these issues will be worked out and are overall not an issue for the overall performance of the platform.
2020-03-01 04:11:21,I will upgrade to 5 Stars when.....,4,2One5,False,"I will upgrade to 5 stars when app developers add a feature to remove ""continue watching"" shows/movies, easier. There needs to be a ""Remove from 'continue watching' "" or a ""delete from watch history"" option. 

In irder to remove shows and movies, i have to fast forward through them in hopes there isnt 5 seaseons of a tv show. For example, I spent over an hour fast forwarding through every episode of Lion Guard just because my niece decided to watch 1 1/2 episodes on my account. ALSO whats up with not having all the Marvel movies?"

I love that u don’t have to go out and buy like 7 Disney movies just to have one movie night with all ur friends when u can just get on this app. I love that they have like a bunch of Disney channel shows too. I’ve been watching Lizzie McGuire that is my absolute fave show of all time bc I watched the movie with my friends when we were really little! I just wish y’all could add movies faster bc it said on a website that frozen 2 isn’t coming until June or July but it may be wrong idk. All I have left to say is: hey now, hey now, this is what dreams are made of! 😂🥰"

But when ever I’m done with that episode it deletes it after and gives me no indication that I’ve already watched that episode. So when I go to download more episodes I have know idea where I left off. So I’m trying to remember the last episode I watched so I can download the next episode and not download the episodes I’ve already watched. It’s annoying, and also whenever I watch a movie and it ends, it will still be on my continue watching even thought it’s at the end credits."
2020-01-18 14:03:58,Great on wifi but deletes from Kindle,3,tired mom79,False,"I love the service when connected to WiFi. But when downloading to my kids Kindle the downloads disappear. If this app is only to work with iOS that needed to be stated upfront. I have an external SD drive, have formatted, and have my app set to download to the external hard drive. But we get on the road and my son has nothing to watch for a 5 hour car ride.  Trying to trouble shoot and the downloads are still taking up space on the external SD card but I cannot get to them. Only option is to download again when we stop somewhere with WiFi. I do not have this issue with a competing streaming app."
2020-01-08 18:33:34,loading issue bugs,3,chnjuhg,False,"other than the small freeze/pause between forwarding and rewinding every time, there is a problem with the rewinding feature. whenever I try to rewind using the 10 second time stamp, the play/pause button disappears and I’m left not being able to rewind or play/pause the video. also, the sound cuts off for a few seconds until I fast forward again. overall, the app is a little bit laggy at times. it wasn’t like that at first but now it is. just a couple of small bugs that I’m sure could be easily fixed. other than that, great variety of shows to binge."
2019-12-25 22:13:17,"Doesn’t work well, you can’t send from phone to TV, it became Disney -",1,iPhonemaple,False,"I was excited to get it, not anymore. I started watching Star Wars at night, after 20 min it stopped and showed loading circle and never came back. Today , Christmas - we started watching old cartoons and quality is so bad. They should remake them, plus later we started watching Spider-Man cartoons and the screen went black , you can hear the sound and black screen. I will be deleting the app, my 6 yrs kids even recommended deleting, they not ready for market with the app. I can’t believe it, we just started watching another show and now screen is green. It works on phone but no option to send to TV like Netflix has. Disney + is Disney -   . So much money and so much time."
2020-10-13 19:30:03,What needs to be improved?,4,Hackrelm,False,"Disney+ is great for Disney superfans and those who aren’t huge fans. There are probably improvements on Disney+, but for now it’s fine. There’s already a currently watching and recommended section. What else do we need? The main reason I used it was because Phineas and Ferb and Crash and Bernstein which was removed from Netflix. I really only use it to watch The Simpsons and some other stuff. Speaking of which, some episodes of The Simpsons should be TV-14, but they say it’s TV-PG. This should be fixed. That is all. But I’m sure there are more bugs to be found."
2019-11-30 06:42:40,Not worth it,1,batmanstwn02,False,"Disney + sounds like an amazing idea, if it would work. It worked for the first week and now when I open the app it says connection error, yet I have full bars and can stream on AppleTV+. So I deleted the app and reinstalled it and now it wants me to contact customer service when I attempt to login. I’m seriously considering canceling my subscription, which is a bummer! But why pay for a service that never works. I would not recommend anyone to start a subscription with Disney + until way later on, so Disney can work out all the bugs, if they can. I would recommend getting AppleTV+, a way more well structured streaming service from a very well structured company. At least Apple knows how to create a more than sustainable streaming service."
2019-11-27 23:11:48,“Currently watching” would change my rating to 5,5,Owen Video,False,"FINAL EDIT: They’ve added “Continue watching!” FINALLY! Woohoo! Review went from 2 to 5 stars.

EDIT: Have become significantly less interested in Disney+ as the days go on. I forget where I left off or with what I was just watching, and without a “Currently/Resume Watching” function, it’s getting useless. Have found myself back on Netflix the past few days just occasionally surfing over Disney+ for nostalgia (in the content). But haven’t gotten hooked yet. PLEASE add this feature.

ORIGINAL:
Content is great, with room for more (Muppets section was surprisingly sparse for example, and limited Marvel movies for now while contracts expire), but without that “Currently watching” or “resume watching” feature it is extremely frustrating to constantly have to re-navigate to that gem you find by accident and started watching. Please update that first!"
2019-11-20 18:18:09,Needs work,3,nottkat,False,The app has good content no doubt. But the fact that they didn’t think to put in a continue watching or watch again is ridiculous. You have no way of knowing what episodes of what show you’ve watched. You have to guess and hope. My other huge issue I have is the fact that they listed title on the app just for you to click and see it won’t actually be available for over a year???????? Why is it showing up then? What was the point in that? I was close to uninstalling and cancelling the subscription when 4 movies in a row were not actually available to watch. Just take them off.
2019-11-15 21:24:25,Great Content! Good UI! Save for a few things.,3,TGTJp,False,"I love the content, the app UI. The only thing that’s frustrating is not having a continue watching, recently watched, etc... the main reason why, if you navigate away from the app for even a short time; the app closes in the background. So now you have to navigate to find what you were watching. 

It wouldn’t be a big deal if there was a Continue Watching and the Watchlist is buried in your Profile page. Having the Watchlist on the menu bar would be helpful as well.

Aside from this, Disney+ is one of the best streaming apps out there with some of the best content. Excited to be using it!"
2020-03-05 13:58:31,"Great content, app needs work.",4,"Dr Who Loves Me, Who Loves Me Not.",False,"Like others have already said, there is either a size limit to the watchlist or there is an issue with the app tracking titles you try to add to your watchlist across devices.

I spent about an hour going through the app finding all the content I wanted to watch and adding titles to the watchlist. When I went to look at my watchlist it was disappointingly small, at least a third of the size that I had spent an hour selecting.

Only a few issues with the loading circle when switching between titles, initially I thought it was an issue with my wireless and the iPad, but it also does it on the Xbox with a wired connection, so there is something to the app having a buffer/preload issue.

Otherwise everything is great, absolutely love the breadth of content they have on offer. So many wonderful gems that haven’t been seen in a long time and exciting new content make the subscription a great value."
2020-09-26 22:51:49,Quality app,5,zumo21,False,"This app has consistently been reliable from the beginning. And they don’t break stuff when they post app updates. That’s huge in today’s world. Sure, they’ve been a little slow to add new features to the app to bring it up to par with other streaming apps, but a more cautious pace of updates and changes helps ensure quality, and I support that. Contrasted with, say, Apple’s approach of dumping a hundred new features into a software release and believing that the release can be of high quality."
2020-03-29 06:48:56,One little bug,5,dforrestjones,False,"Great app! Loving everything about it. The only issue I keep seeing is the visual will freeze every time a notification comes up and the audio keeps going. So, I have to exit out and go back in and hope it works. Usually it does. However, some movies like the black cauldron and the Sword in the stone stopped loading and wouldn’t play anymore. It was very frustrating. Just a little issue to help out with the overall enjoyment of the app. Just really don’t like his finicky it is. Thanks so much!"
2020-01-04 17:49:25,Buggy But Good,4,Werdy,False,"A few times when sitting down to watch The Mandalorian, the Apple TV app said it couldn’t connect. Disappointing!

When skipping back 10 seconds on the Apple TV, the loading spinner remains onscreen half the time. Pausing and playing again clears it, but it’s very annoying.

There’s a similar defect on the iPhone app, where if you tap to bring up the controls and hit the skip back button, the controls are replaced with a loading spinner. Content continues to play, but whenever you attempt to bring up the controls again, the spinner is still there."
2019-11-21 02:30:23,Great App!,4,neler327,False,"I love Disney+ because of the multiple shows I get to watch. It has been great. It would be nice to have a “continue watching” list but I know it takes some time to fix problems. I have only run into one problem. When I log in, it tells me to contact customer service but nothing more than that. I’m still on the free trial and I’ve only been able to watch Disney+ two out of the five days I’ve had it because of this issue. Customer service was contacted but nothing was resolved. Disney+ is overall a great app and I can’t wait to see how far it goes!"
2019-12-06 02:40:01,AMAZING but...,5,WR__SniperGod21,False,"I LOVE Disney Plus it is so awesome, you could watch hundreds of movies or tv shows in there just with a click, and don’t forget great downloading features. I do have one question though I noticed that on the show Ravens Home it only has two seasons on Disney Plus. When I went to go see on DisneyNOW (another app for watching that Disney made) it has four seasons which confused me and I thought that would be on Disney Plus also. Hopefully they get all the seasons so people can enjoy them!! Thank you hope you get back to me!"

The people that have given the app a two and one star  rating didn’t know how to sign up but if it makes the makers feel better for the truth tell them that the only reason they gave those ratings is because they are jealous that they don’t have the money to make an app like this one"
2019-11-19 20:05:53,Huge Issues...almost not worth it,2,Choco_Pebbles1999,False,"I love that there is so much variety from classics to new age shows and movies.  I agree with other reviews though. There needs to be a “Recently Viewed or Watched” option. Also, there is a lot of issues with shows and movies lagging, or not playing back. The screen freezes while the sound continues. Keeps telling me there is a problem with what I’m watching. I’ve close the apps, restarted my devices, uninstalled it then installed it again, checked my internet connection is good and now I have to wait on the phone for over an hour to get any kind of help. Extremely frustrating! Please fix. Would love to be able to give it five stars."
2019-11-18 21:48:29,Room for improvements,3,sarah093090,False,"I want to start with the two things that I was surprised to be missing from this streaming service: a ‘continue watching’ category, and the time stamp bar on the content you’re watching to indicate how far into the program you left off watching. With so many streaming services out there, I don’t understand how Disney could have missed including this on their platform? Anyways, aside from that, there is great content in this platform with more to come! With those two issues I mentioned above aside, I would certainly recommend this app and I can’t wait to see the content that’s in the line-up!"
2019-11-17 17:33:45,Amazing work,3,TomBradyFan610,False,"This truly is amazing. I love to how there is such a wide variety of movies and shows on here. This seriously brings back so much memories. However, there does need to be some changes. The app would be a lot better if 1)you added a “currently watching list” like Netflix. This can help prevent people from forgetting what episode or what movie they were watching. Plus there’s a bug to where I’m unable to remove movies from my watchlist. Yes I can add it to my list, but not remove it however. Also, add the watchlist button on the bottom so it’s more convenient for everyone instead of having to go to settings and clicking that."
2019-11-17 17:10:36,Continue Watching?,5,J Dizzy Whizzy,False,"I love this app. It’s probably the best streaming application in the world. It’s better than every other streaming app in many ways. It’s pretty cheap compared to other streaming apps. It has lots of amazing content. And lots of people can watch at one time. There’s only one problem, how am I supposed to remember the things that I started watching if they’re not listed!? Please make a continue watching section. (And fix the Simpsons cropping problem). Other than those two things, this is a great app to have."
2019-11-16 16:57:41,Wonderful,4,seerby,False,"I grew up with so much of what is now available through Disney+.  Great to have all these movies/shows available now.  The format is excellent, so much so that I call it Disney Netflix.  I have just one issue, and that is there’s not a row on the home screen labeled “Continue watching.”  On Netflix, you can easily start movies or shows, then pick them up later because it keep track of what you’ve opened and started to watch, and it resumes at the point you stopped.  That has been my only complaint thus far, and if that were fixed, it would be perfect.  ❤️"
2019-11-14 22:31:39,Remove the “Skip Intro” button and we’re good!,4,Keith M. Adams,False,"My experience with Disney+ has been pretty awesome so far! They’ve got loads of Disney, Pixar, Marvel, National Geographic, Lucasfilm & Fox titles, all suitable for family viewing by the way. Then, you have original content like “The Mandalorian”, “Noelle”, “Lady and the Tramp”, “Encore!”, “HSM - The Musical: The Series” and more as well. The navigation is very good, the video quality is excellent and good call adding special features too. The gripe about it that needs to go away is the “Skip Intro” button. Why would I skip the theme song to a classic Disney or Marvel show? Remove that and everything is all good!"
2019-11-16 16:29:28,Great,3,The real Truth.,False,"The app is great, it has almost every Disney movie I watched growing up with a few exceptions. All the Marvel movies are here which is amazing and for the first time all the Simpsons episodes. The only negative is that none of these movies or shoes are dubbed in Any other language. We live in a diverse country that is built from different languages. An audio option is desperately needed so that more people can enjoy the app like Netflix. Another big issue is that it doesn’t keep track of what episode you last watched. I been watching the Simpsons and every time it restarts from episode one. Instead of going to the season and episode I last left on."

When I was with my kids watching Disney channel and Disney XD their were a lot of shows that are not on Disney +. My kids used to love shows like Right Now Kapow, Two More Eggs, Walk the prank, but it is not on Disney +. These shows did bad when it comes to ratings but they are still Disney classics to my kids. My kids were excited to see that and that is why I was trying to get a account early. (The rights to Right Now Kapow belongs to Warner Brothers studio so that might be why it is not on Disney +.)"

Third , it keep saying that I need to relog in due to error 83. So I did , and NOW it’s saying that it is having trouble connecting to my account . Look !

2020-08-05 19:22:06,Great.... ish,4,Merve Okumus,False,"While I love Disney and this app, it seems to be very buggy. When I try to go back by 10 seconds, the video buffers for a long time... causing me to leave the whole show and click back on. This isn’t just the playback button, but also the skipping button. It isn’t very smooth, and makes you question skipping ahead because it starts to buffer a long and you might as well stay where you’re at in the show. Overall I love the content in the app, but it seems to be buggy. I hope in the next update it won’t be like that!"
2020-01-02 08:59:24,Pretty good overall...,4,Mason De Guzman,False,"From MY experience I’ve have barely any problems with the app and PS4 application and we have had it the day it was released. The only issue I have is on the PS4 application, it would buffer out of nowhere but audio would continue still. (But some of these one star reviews I’m seeing are just STUPID, most of them are just complaining about it not available in their countries and shows not available on the app just yet.) If your wondering when it will be available in YOUR region just look it up and stop leaving one star reviews here. THEY WILL NOT RESPOND HERE!"
2020-04-11 18:04:37,Sick of this,1,pumpkinbasket,False,"I’m honestly probably abt to delete this app. You guys need to work on it. BC I have 20+ gb of downloaded content inside the app. i installed it on launch date and downloaded a lot or content. The app messed up, and I contacted you guys abt it, but there was no solution provided. So I deleted the app and started over. so last night I downloaded content; and it crashed, and then it would stay stuck on a dark blue tinted screen then crash down. so I had to delete it oncemore. At this point I’m really angry. But I tried again, and downloaded about 25gb worth of content. and the app is not opening again. This is making me very angry because I’m spending my time downloading content since I don’t have good service. For rn, this app is trash. please fix this."
2020-04-04 03:02:40,I like it but I was disappointed...,5,SixPixles,False,"This app is pretty cool! I love using it! The only thing I’m a little upset over is the fact that there missing the one show I was hoping and praying that had. I was looking for “mighty med” in particular. Over all the app is great and I have no complaints. I was just kinda hoping they’d have it and they didn’t. I’m not mad or upset btw I just figured I could say it here so the devs could see it, I’m pretty sure this doesn’t have a recommendation bar that you can type stuff into like Netflix does."
2020-02-29 21:51:36,One Issue,5,phoebster6707,False,"I love love love Disney+! A perfect place to stream all of my favorite shows and movies. It was surprising to me that they included more than just Disney channel and Pixar. It’s perfect, because I am a huge marvel fan! But, to me there is one issue. I feel like the app takes up WAY too much storage. It could partly be my phone, as I am always having issues with storage. I feel like others may have this problem too. If there is anything the developers can do to make it take up less storage, it would be great."
2020-01-31 09:52:57,I’m obsessed 🥰,5,2022rose,False,Oh my god! I finally got Disney plus and I’m so shocked by all the movies and shows they have on here. I’m 17 and I didn’t really want to get this but they have literally all the throw back tv shows from Disney Channel that I’m dying to watch. And they have all the under rated Disney movies too. I’m most excited for Cinderella 2 and 3. I think Disney plus is officially better then Netflix!! It’s actually amazing. I hope they don’t take any movies or shows off bc I have a huge list to get watching. Thanks Disney for this amazing app!!!

I see everyone rating this app almost perfect but from everything my household has experienced with it, I gave a 3 just because of the movies I can almost watch"

Sometimes I will get a call during a show and it continues to play the show while I’m taking the call and I can’t pause it so I have to end the call. Second, compared to Netflix this app takes a long time to rewind or reload the show when u exit to another app and then bring the show back up. And last it still doesn’t show what episodes I’ve watched with a little bar underneath like Netflix or with a little checkmark which would be great."
2019-11-17 22:21:29,Almost Perfect,4,ChronoSnow963,False,Almost everything on disney plus is great from the content to the interface except for two things       1. You can’t tell what or how much you have watched without starting the show/movie and looking at the time bar and 2. The little plus next to the titles of the shows/movies at first glance seems to be like Netflix’s my list but the button adds it to nothing and it resets every time you go in and out of info for a show. If those two things are fixed this is for sure 5 stars probably is 4 1/2 but I don’t have that option
2019-12-27 20:26:43,Disney+ Rocks!!,5,Gamergirl6958,False,"I don’t normally write reviews but this app deserves a review!! I love Disney so when this app came out I was both excited and a little apprehensive. Now I use this app daily. I love that the movies I enjoy are at my finger tips. The streaming is awesome. The app setup makes it very easy to navigate and use. 
I’ll definitely recommend this app to anyone who may be interested. Yes, there’s a fee that has to be paid to use it but after the first time you try it the monthly fee is more than worth it.
Right On Disney - keep up the good work!!"
2019-12-20 04:33:59,I really wanted to love this,1,Carbary03,False,"As most things nowadays they seemed to have launched this app without doing all the necessary R&D. Tried watching The Mandalorian tonight after downloading all the episodes only to find out that I can’t airplay them from my phone to my TV, not can I plug an HDMI from my iPhone directly to the TV. What’s the point in downloading the episodes if you can’t watch them offline on a bigger screen? In order to get around this huge glitch I deleted the episodes and tried to stream only to have it cut out and buffer 6-7 times throughout the episode. Really enjoyed what I was able to watch, but the experience using this app is so awful I am probably going to bail on the rest of the show. Nice try Disney, but this app is quite the fail."
2019-11-16 05:56:05,Need currently playing and remove from watchlist,4,szimme86,False,"This app desperately needs a “currently watching” the play button also doesn’t switch to resume once something is started, and I can’t see how far I was into anything. It’s also not easy to add and remove items from watch history. Once an episode or show has been seen, it would be nice for it to be removed automatically from a watchlist. I also wish you could have an overlay of what I am currently watching on the video player. Artwork with a synopsis. Anyways I hope this gets some needed upgrades"
2019-11-17 01:36:44,Best app ever!,5,coloradospringsgirl,False,"I was a little cautious of getting this app because I have Netflix. But after reading reviews and having my friends talk about this app, I decided to give it a try. And I am so glad I have it! They have a lot of movies that Netflix doesn’t have! A lot of Disney classics and Disney TV shows such as Jessie, Hannah Montana, That’s so Raven etc, and they have some non Disney stuff as well. I love the Simpsons! They have all 30 seasons of the Simpsons! They have Aladdin 1, 2 and 3! Cinderella 1, 2 and 3! Toy Story 1, 2  and 3. And so much more! If you are a Disney fan this a must have!!"
2019-11-16 20:32:54,Still new,3,Deeeeveeeee144400000999,False,I get it’s the first week the app has been up and running but it’s got a few bugs especially when I cast from my phone. Every other episode it stops playing and I have to recast it. It doesn’t show what so episodes I’ve watched or leave off where I had watched last. And it doesn’t have a list of what I have already started watching so I either have to make my own watch list and go to that or just search it. Really inconvenient. I’m enjoying all the content and all it’s just annoying trying to watch more than two episodes in one sitting. It might be different on a laptop or the fire stick.
2019-11-14 23:53:27,Frustrating,1,Cjavakabsk,False,The day it came out I was so exited and I logged in an everything was fine for the first 5 hours. Then it logged me out and I can’t log back in. I have been trying for 3 days now and I’m so frustrated. It keeps telling me to call customer service and I did and I have been on hold for 3 hours and I haven’t gotten through to anyone. I’ve tried everything like deleting the app and re-installing it but I keep getting the same thing. I have logged in over and over again but nothing is working. I’m on hold right now and I have been for the past hour or so. Don’t get me wrong I’m so exited for this app. Like I’ve never been this happy before. It’s frustrating tho when everyone else can use it and you can’t. If you can help me please do.
2019-11-13 22:13:18,“Keep Watching Tab”,4,HWNSuperman,False,"I am SO HAPPY that all of this content is now available on the go!!! My only complaint or suggestion would be to have a “Keep Watching” section like Netflix does so that I don’t have to search for what I was watching or use the watchlist. Secondly to that, I wish that I could just click play on a title screen and get right back to the episode that I was watching last.

Example: I started watching X-Men TAS but started late into season 2 because I was already watching it on a different platform but if I click play from the title screen, it starts with season 1 episode 1."
2020-09-06 20:23:25,Really good,4,wof glory,False,"It’s amazing but I have some ideas!!! :) Okay, so on the continue watching what if you could like delete it from your watch list. I think that would help because sometimes people don’t want everyone to see what they’ve watched. I don’t know if that’s just me though. 🤷‍♀️
Maybe have a camera for the profile so you could take a picture of yourself. I don’t really know how well that would work, but I think it would be cool!
Sometimes Disney plus doesn’t let me watch something even if I press on it! Other all it’s amazing thanks for it!"
2020-09-20 19:37:33,Constantly stopping due to bad interface,3,beachlvr2265,False,"First of all, whenever I couldn't watch Disney + due to the app either stopping or buffering I switched to Prime Video or HBOMax and had NO problems. It also freezes up on some pages so I am unable to watch anything without exiting and restarting. Not for something I'm paying for Disney.
Also, if I'm in the middle of a movie or series, those items should be the first line at the top of the home page under the banner and the "" recommended for you,"" which is at the top is worthless.
I'm sure Disney will fix these problems but I'm not paying while they improve the app."
2020-09-09 10:48:58,Great service until Premier Access... now it’s trash,1,Recovering MCOC addict,False,"I paid for an entire year upfront when the service launched, great content at a fantastic price.  Then all of a sudden I get a bill for “premier access” which I didn’t have any and can’t turn off.  No one in my home chose to purchase the feature and I can’t say no thanks and have it go away.  This one feature has made me question the viability of the entire platform.  I got this service for my kids, but because Disney wants to push services and movies I can’t even let them watch it for fear of them accidentally making a purchase that I can’t turn off or prevent from occurring.  

Thanks for taking a great product and turning it into a financial liability for my family."
2020-05-10 11:13:57,Annoying fast forward bug,4,UnkownUnicorn4,False,"Hi, so I have been having troubles starting from the past few days and there’s this bug, like when I’m watching a movie it will skip ahead a scene and when I try to to go back to the place I was to watch the scene it’ll go right back to skipping it and I can’t seem to fix it, it’s really annoying to try to enjoy a movie when you can’t watch it. Now I love Disney+ and I really recommend getting it but this bug is very annoying and needs to be fixed pronto, I would love to enjoy a FULL movie with my family. Thank you."
2020-06-24 13:52:56,What gets me mad the most,5,niall hora,False,"I can’t believe they wouldn’t have all Disney shows even this show I was looking for that is not even that old it is not fair that wizards of waverly palace jonas hannah Montana on this app I am angry that I couldn’t enjoy those shows but this is not the first time I search a Disney movie and I get no result of it I’m just saying I’m a person who wants to visit there child hood because sadly it is going away every time I blink my eyes.  But other than that this app is not so bad so but all I am saying is fir these shows I made a list to please be added because it is disney and some people actually want to watch it so pls
1. Ant farm
2. Dog with a blog
3. Cory in the house
4. Jungle junction 
5. Agent oso 
And that’s just it for now at least like get it on there pls do what you can because kinda making me mad!!! I need these shows and plus maybe get some 80s Disney or something"
2020-01-24 16:28:16,Great app - one flaw,4,Remi_the_Rat,False,"I watch Disney+ very often now and there’s always been one issue that I’ve noticed. The continue watching feature is a bit buggy. It doesn’t seem to update to the last episode or minute you were on, or transfer correctly from your television to your mobile device. For example: I’ll go from watching Disney+ in my living room then move to my room and watch on my phone, however it will put me back multiple episodes/minutes. Thank you so much and please fix this bug!!! Otherwise this is a great app :)."

HOPE YOU OTHER PEOPOLE WILL START APPRICIATING DISNEY +"
2019-12-31 16:56:43,A bit disappointed,4,Riya Bhutani,False,"I was thrilled when Disney+ released because I was excited to be able to watch my favorite movies all in one place. However the last couple times I’ve tried to watch something, whether on my phone or on Chromecast, it’ll play for about 40 seconds then it will buffer. Then it’ll play for 3 minutes then buffer. This keeps happening throughout the movie and it’s really frustrating because an hour or so long film turns into 2 hours. I’ve updated the app to the most recent version, yet this keeps happening."
2020-01-19 17:57:37,Flakey app on AppleTV,2,Benny5579,False,"This app is very flakey.  When the TV auto shut down occurs, the AppleTV screen saver will come on.  When you go back to the app, Disney+ will be playing audio of the movie or show, but you cannot bring up the video.  If you try to watch another movie it will then have your new show playing while audio of the second show is in the background.

I’ve been trying to watch Mandalorian but at the end of each episode it forces you to menu back to the main page and re-enter.  The UI becomes unresponsive.

I hope they address these issues, the first issue sucked up a lot of bandwidth while the TV was off.  I don’t want any surprise bills for data usage"
2019-12-23 12:04:41,Good but not perfect,4,Daniel Yu-cua,False,"The app is pretty decent overall, but needs some tweaks in order to be more user friendly 

1. When hitting continue to watch on a television show there is no easy way to get to the list of episodes. If I click on a show from the continue to watch section I will be dumped directly into the episode, but there is no next episode button, or all episode button to get me to the next episode of the series. Instead I have to go back to the main menu and look up the show I was watching and click into the show. 

2. No support for asian subtitles. It’s surprising to think that Disney would not implement this on launch. 

3. I can get a funny sound glitch to occur when switching between Netflix and Disney. Where the Netflix loading sound will play upon opening the app. (I think this is more of an OS error rather than the app itself, but still something that probably should be brought to light)"
2019-11-21 22:20:14,WiFi compatibility,4,Lexyrenee37,False,"I love this app so much, but for the love of god it is so finicky. I can only watch it on my phone because apparently my internet connection is not strong enough even though it works for every other service available. Please fix the issue with this app requiring absolutely exceptional WiFi only. It’s not my fault that I live on campus and only have the schools WiFi. Like it won’t even work on my iPad unless I add my cellular plan to it because the streaming service doesn’t think the WiFi is good enough. It’s excessive, so please fix this. It’s so frustrating."
2019-11-23 16:49:47,Favorite Streaming App,5,MQ107,False,"I absolutely love the Disney+ app and it includes most of my childhood favorites and new favorites. I just wish we had a continue watching section and that if I need to finish watching a movie or a show that it’ll stay exactly where I last watched instead of having to fast forward. Also, I wish the app was available on Sony Smart TV’s. Please make these updates to the app because it’ll make it more easier to use for everyone. But, Thank you for making the Disney+ app."
2019-11-17 10:46:47,Only Two Complaints,4,Dyno0688,False,"Overall it’s a truly amazing app. I just wish I could subscribe thru my Apple ID like with practically every other app. Also I wish they made it easier to continue watching from where I left off. 

The subscription issue isn’t major but the lack of a continue watching feature is very surprising. Not sure how Disney could be miss such a basic and important feature. They don’t even mark episodes you’ve already watched, so good luck if you fall asleep watching a show and don’t remember what episode you were in last."
2019-11-21 15:14:56,"Good app, needs a few updates",3,gimmeyourshoelaces,False,"First of all, I love having all the old and new Disney shows and movies all in one app and overall it’s a great app. But I do have a few problems with it. For one thing, you have to remember what episode you are on because there isn’t any “Continue Watching” button on the app. Also, on some shows like phineas and ferb, the episodes aren’t in order, on the app it says the REAL first episode is episode 8, which doesn’t make any sense. I’m not sure if it’s like that for ALL shows but I’m sure it’s like that on more than one. Anyway I do recommend the app to anyone but it definitely needs a few updates."
2019-11-14 00:20:21,Love it but needs some improvement for the future,4,fkpr1996,False,I have loved streaming all the old Disney movies and Disney shows from my childhood! I’m 23 without any kids and bought this streaming service for myself. I think they could use better categories. I also find it incredibly annoying that they do not pick up from the last episode you left on with a series. I’ve watched a few Kim Possible episodes and each time I go to the series page it starts me over at episode 1. I think they need to make some improvements but overall I have loved this app!
2019-11-16 08:55:06,Love Disney!,5,Slackster91,False,"This app is absolutely amazing and I will definitely recommend to anyone and everyone. Since it is brand new, I do have a few suggestions. A continue watching area would be great! Life is busy and sometimes you can’t finish a movie in one sitting no matter how badly you want to. Also when watching a series, remembering what episode that was left off on would be great. Some time episode titles blend in and it is such a pain to start an episode you have already watched. Other than that it’s great! Love you Disney!"
2019-11-16 03:17:38,Freezing issues,1,klr2lnd18,False,"It keeps freezing whenever it’s being watched on our tv. It doesn’t do it when watching on the iPhone. We have a HDMI lightning cable that goes from the phone to the tv and that’s how we watch on the tv as a family. The picture keeps freezing but we will have sound. Or will get super pixelated and freeze but still have sound as well.  We have to back out and go back to the movie several times to get it to work right. We have closed the app and reopened other streaming apps and they all work fine, so we know the problem is the Disney+ app. Frustrated with it. We don’t want to pay for a streaming service that won’t work on our tv for all 6 of us to view as a family. Please resolve this issue. Thanks!"
2019-11-14 02:35:32,"Ha ha, no.",2,t.orelle,False,"They really tried. I saw a bunch of commercials for Disney plus including the Simpsons one and many others, and a bunch of snap chats about it. Little did I know that the minute I’d download the app it would say at the bottom of the screen “Start streaming Disney+ with your 1 week free trial, then only $6.99/month.” Heck no. I’m not about to pay $7.00 a month to watch teens auditioning for high school musical. Disney+ is a great concept, and I like that it’s directed for an older audience. However, I can’t stand how apps these days expect you to pay money. No. I give it 2 stars because it’s a great concept and the ads for Disney+ were great, but I’m instantly deleting after writing this review, I’m not paying for this nonsense."
2019-11-13 18:50:48,Worth it,4,Fawzito,False,"First things first. Disney+ is awesome! I love watching my favorite Star Wars movies and TV shows, and I really love the Hulu+ESPN package. However, I think the most frustrating thing for me right now is that whenever I watch a show, it starts over from the beginning. What do I mean? I’m watching Star Wars rebels and I’m on Season 3 right? Well I take a look around at what other Disney shows there are to watch, however when I return to Star Wars Rebels, the series starts over from the beginning!! S1E1. So Disney I know you’re barely starting this, and you’re doing a great job! I love the content. But please fix this!!!"
2019-11-12 17:44:31,Pretty good,4,Earatha,False,"So the pros: the app does what it’s supposed to. It grants access to the Disney+ and streaming is pretty smooth. Both on cellular and WiFi streaming quality is high. The selection is wide, of course, because it’s Disney. 

Cons: sometimes the “continue watching” row will disappear, which is annoying but not a big deal. Some shows and movies aren’t there, I don’t know why but that’s their choice. What is annoying is the lack of a category search or sidebar. 

Overall I’m satisfied. But am interested how the algorithm will adjust to show new content as it gets to know my viewing patterns."
2019-11-12 21:26:49,"Amazing app, you can watch a Disney movie anytime. Anywhere.",5,RuceyyJJ555,False,"I love Disney so much and I have been waiting for this app to come out since the day they said they were going to release it. It does not have the very newest movies, but I am so excited to finally be able to watch Disney movies  whenever and where ever I want! Love this app and would definitely recommend buying this because it is 2x less than Netflix, and has so many movies from so many different studios.(Disney,Marvel, Pixar, Nat Geo, and Star Wars!!!!)Would recommend this, great app."
2019-12-23 01:49:20,Great App but Not the Best Setup,4,Grade A Ostritch,False,"There are a couple things with this set up that doesn’t really work well. For one thing, when I click on a show I am currently watching it automatically plays the next episode. I would rather it just pop up the menu for the show, on the episode I am on, that way I can jump around episode. My other problem is when I search Disney shows instead of showing what is new  or most popular it goes more alphabetically (for example duck tales pops up the older one and the movie first)

Other than that it is a great app!"
2019-11-12 08:28:10,Amazing in Legacy Devices,5,MASTER SHINOBI,False,"I had a chance to test the quality of the stream and it is amazing! Works great on older iOS devices. Ultra High Definition Video Stream and 5.1 surround sound is amazing?”! Download was fast from App Store and no lagging when using app, login or watching content! They definitely spent money wisely for day one use being perfect. Let us see how it handles in the next few days. Perfect for Family to see Disney Classic that are safer, family friendly for all ages and great way to bond with Disney’s great content from the Disney Vault!! ;)😉"
2020-05-05 08:46:49,Only one flaw I’ve noticed,3,gugar01,False,"Everything loads and plays perfectly fine, I haven’t noticed the other things people have commented about. The one issue I did notice though, is that when I’m watching something on my phone the screen will develop faint lines going horizontally across and the lighting shifts slightly, almost like a haze. I tried all my other apps and they all worked fine. It’s especially noticeable when the screen goes dark, for example if you’re starting a Star Wars movie and the the screen is a dark space setting, it is extremely noticeable and rather distracting."
2020-04-15 06:30:09,Missing content,1,g-a-b says,False,I have been binge watching Phineas and Ferb and the order of the episodes are all wrong  which can sometimes take away from its story also I sometimes go looking for episodes I would like to watch and there not there like for example I was looking for the episode The remains Perry the platypus from season 3 episode 34 and the episode that is there is not that episode the episode that is there was this is your backstory not the same or interchangeable also I looked up online there are 222 episodes of Phineas and Ferb but on Disney+ there are 110 not even half therefore missing out on a lot of the story doing the creator a injustice I hope that this is a work in progress and y’all are putting the rest of the episodes on shortly
2020-02-22 03:00:17,Disney plus is ok,5,Mad😀,False,I was so excited that Disney plus came out it has tons of Disney movies and shows to watch that we all love if your a Disney fan. I know Disney plus kinda just came out but I was hoping for more new shows but there is a lot of new shows or movies and there is some new tv shows and movies but there not that great. Disney plus sometime doesn’t work because of the WiFi so it sometimes hard to watch if your WiFi no that great. I hope Disney plus come out with more tv shows and movies.
2020-02-10 22:32:23,Ummm I don’t think so,1,MariMaria101,False,So I saw this app on an ad and immediately downloaded. I was soooo happy and when I opened the app my whole world went down the drain I was sad I was like that’s a downer then I saw the start a free trial button and then here comes another downer it’s only one week........ bro chill I still can’t even get one month 2 downers so far that’s bad you Disney kids sometimes can’t pay for this even if they ask their parents that is U N F O R G I V A B L E!! All upper case that is horrible so Disney thank you for ruining a lot of childhoods and mine I wish I could give this no stars tbh well Disney ya better watch out because you never know when a company can go downhill if you agree write a review with 1 star and write this to know it’s me !Dj! Write that if you agree ugh I am disgusted
2019-12-30 00:20:22,"Play, Rewind and FF Buttons Keep Disappearing",2,Lyon4ik,False,"When playing videos the control buttons (play, rewind and fast forward) keep disappearing. Instead, there’s a rotating circle (similar to the one when videos are loading). You then have to exit the video to pause or rewind / FF the video.

Also, can you explain why you added the My List button (“+” button) if you haven’t built it into the app - there’s currently no menu to view the videos I’ve added to my list, so the button / menu is completely useless...

Lastly, besides Mandolorian, the content is fairly old. I’m probably not in your target demographic, but for a guy in mid-30s, there’s not much to watch beyond Mandolorian and NG shows."
2019-12-28 00:28:51,"Good app, but subtitles are a nuisance",5,tia10monster,False,"My husband and I have been using the app and we really love all of the Disney content being in one spot. We are also obsessed with new content, especially the Mandalorian! 
However, the subtitles are a total nuisance! No matter how many times we turn them off, they continue to default back...even in the middle of a show or movie. Most of the time when the subtitles are deselected, it does nothing! Super annoying for an otherwise good app filled with all of our Disney favorites!"
2019-12-20 02:13:23,Missing content,4,486pete,False,"Overall I’m liking this app. Not having the technical problems others experienced. There’s lots of things to watch but it doesn’t have everything. I grew up watching Disney Channel when it was a subscription channel on cable. Where is “Welcome to Pooh Corner”, “Dumbo’s Circus”, “Adventures in Wonderland” “Aladdin: The Series”, “101 Dalmatians: The Series” just to name a few. I’m liking this app for the most part but would like EVERYTHING Disney Channel had to offer, not just the newer stuff since Disney became a free cable channel. That’s barely the chip of the iceberg that is Disney. Doing ok, do better."
2019-12-01 06:17:11,Won’t Resume where I left off,4,Jay_Thom,False,This app is amazing but one thing that is really annoying is that the movies or tv shows that I watch won’t resume where I left off. I use Disney+ on 3 different devices. 2 TVs and 1 phone. It’s really frustrating trying to remember where I left off because it restarts the movie or episode. (This happens on all my devices by the way). I don’t know if any one else is experiencing this but it’s annoying. I wonder if it’s just a big or glitch but I hope it gets fixed soon. It was working fine until a couple of days ago.
2019-12-05 15:04:47,Love,5,Iandotc0m,False,"Nostalgia, new loves and good feelings. Everything Disney including old Disney Channel originals that came straight from my childhood. There isn’t anything to hate about this service except one thing; a “continue watching” feature. 

It’s annoying to have to search for everything that is being watched after having to close the app. It’s a small feature but one that I think would make Disney + perfect. If that gets added, it’ll become a 5 star review for sure.

EDIT: THANK YOU FOR ADDING THE “CONTINUE WATCHING” FEATURE OMG ILY PLZ LOVE ME BACK."
2019-11-19 03:59:48,Needs a “Continue Watching”!,4,Skyduzt Author,False,"I definitely agree with other reviews. The content is great, but there is no “continue watching” section like in other streaming apps. You have to save whatever you’re watching to your watchlist, or search for it, anytime you close the app. There’s also no “progress bar” to tell you which episodes of a show you’ve watched already, nor where you left off, so you have to remember. 
Content is great, but I hope these issues get sorted! I would also love to see a “Recommended for you” based on viewing history."
2019-11-25 17:17:21,Unable to use my account at all after Paying!,2,IjustwanttowatchDisney,False,"I have had Disney + for one week now and have been unable to use the app for 4 days and it says it’s unable to connect to my account, please re-enter information but yet I have still been unable to login over many days. You guys took the $7 out of my account and now I cannot even login to watch a single thing. I contacted customer support to which you guys don’t have an email option? Only calling, waiting 30 mins to chat online or through twitter. It’s a waste of time and I guess the servers are over loaded. I don’t know what to do. I’d rather not cancel this month yet since I just paid but I paid for no reason!"
2019-11-20 22:56:06,love it 😩but pleaseeee add a continue watching feature,5,faif smif,False,"i absolutely love it . definitely better than netflix 🤣✅and thats saying a lot . but i wish yall would add the ""continue watching"" feature because if i dont finish a movie in one sitting then ill have to go and find the movie and most of the time i forgot what the name of it was , or when im watching a  Series . i get iut of the app for awhile and go back and have no idea what episode i was on. and it doesnt tell you if youve watched it already. so please pleaseeeee add the continue watching ."
2019-11-20 15:36:20,Content amazing- actual app not so much,3,tay1477,False,"If I was rating this based off content it would be 5 stars hands down. But the actual interface is pretty annoying. It doesn’t ever store which episodes you’ve watched so you have to go back and find it each time. It doesn’t have any sort of memory storage for shows /movies you’re currently watching. Would like to see this updated or fixed. I also wish the National Geographic side had more browsing features so you know what they even offer. But other than that I’m so glad this came out, has every possible show or movie you could think of."
2019-11-18 23:30:23,love it but..,4,km8204,False,"so far i am really loving disney +. it has some of my favorite movies, movies and shows from my childhood, and stuff i didnt even know belonged to disney. i really hate how there isnt a “currently watching” tab though. it gets really annoying really fast when i have to research what i was watching every time i leave the app or stop watching it for whatever reason. i’ve also been having trouble with my captions turning on. every time i open up something to watch or reopen the app to watch something i was watching earlier, the captions come on no matter how often i turn them off. i don’t use the captions at all nor do i share an account so its not because of either of those reasons. i also cant edit my watchlist using my phone and can only do it using my ps4 (maybe computer too but i haven't tried on there yet.) but besides those three inconveniences, i’m really loving it and would recommend to anyone."
2019-11-17 04:21:55,Wish it could be a 5,4,Vampyreofsa,False,"If you all had a “recently watched” section , that would be awesome. It’s hard to remember what episode I was watching of Gargoyles. A “recently watched” section would be really good. Also, the add to watch list (+) doesn’t indicate that it was added. You can add it and it goes back the + sign. And, you should have a way to have your users manually categorize movies alphabetically or have an automated way where the app does that. If you all can do all of that, your rating would be WAY higher than a 5. And I would be happy to change my review in that regard."
2019-11-18 02:37:26,"Good content, poorly designed app across the board",3,APConstant,False,"Great content which was expected. The user interface is poorly made, however. There is no “continue watching” feature like every other streaming service.  This is very frustrating and the main reason I gave it a 3 star, because I have to remember where I am located in anything I watch.  There is also no way to personalize the individual users outside of a watchlist and a user character. This feature may get better over time as the service recognizes what I watch consistently, but as of now personal recommendations are more of what Disney wants you to watch."
2019-11-16 16:29:38,It works great !,4,awesomekid👻,False,It’s pretty easy to navigate like Netflix has all the old Disney. Handel movies which I love working good so far ☺️ the only thing I have an issue with is why ? Certain movies said the won’t realease until next year ??? Like what is up with that they aren’t brand new movies either also the new shows that only have 1 episode like madalorian should say when the next episode will be available is it going to be released weekly ? Idk but overall happy with this 👍🏽 also why are some hot shoes like STAR BUTTERFLY MISSING ! 😱😑 and Disney please consider adding lots of free form movies/ shows plz
2019-11-16 17:02:48,Why release an unfinished project,1,Lhampton91,False,Very frustrating that there isn’t a continue watching. Can’t tell what episodes I’ve even watch so always losing track. It took 2 days for my account to even show in the app so I could start adding show I wanted to watch. Then they tease us with putting show on there but we can’t watch till the end of next year for some reason. Episodes don’t automatically play after one is finished. Every single episode I put on has closed captions and I have to turn them off every single time. Everyone’s giving this app good stars for the content but come on how many competitors do you have with apps that work? Too many for you to get it wrong or tell us you’ll have changes coming next year.
2019-11-15 04:55:21,"So much, for so little a month",4,mamajo2019,False,"This app is really great overall. It has all of the movies I could think of and more shows than I ever remember being on when I was younger. It’s definitely worth the price (right now it’s free through Verizon, but I’d still pay the monthly fee for it). The only downside is that there isn’t a continue watching feature, so you have to search for the show/movie you were watching each time you enter the app and it doesn’t save your spot when you leave a show/movie so it starts over from the beginner with each break."
2019-11-14 22:49:11,Not available on Chromecast,4,Villela1,False,"Was really looking forward to the app and then it comes out and is not supported on my Vizio Chromecast tv. Not sure why an application like this would be released without the ability to stream on all smart TVs and devices from the jump. Hopefully there’s an update soon. 

-Update: 
After some thought I figured it might not be Disney’s fault that the app is not supported on Vizio. Maybe it is on Vizio and regardless of who is at fault the app itself is great and provides awesome content. Of course a few updates will be good for the app in the future. I’m enjoying it so far."
2019-11-15 02:18:47,Disney XD?,5,CoachCoolCow,False,"Disney plus is very great so far. I love that there are all the old shows and movies that I watched as a kid, and now I can rewatch them all. The only question I have is why are there no Disney XD shows? Have I missed something, like are Disney XD and Disney not related? I really wanted to rewatch some of my favorite shows like Pair of Kings, Zeke and Luther, and Kick Buttowski. Overall a super great app. One thing to add would be a “Currently watching” list, that way we can easily click on the shows or movies we’re watching from where we last left off. Thanks! :)"
2019-11-13 15:38:51,Great for fans,4,NationWizAssociation,False,"Disney plus is awesome but many popular Disney shows aren’t on there. Also online it is a little bit glitchy. There isn’t a continue watching thing so every time I want to continue watching something I have to find the show and go back there and find the episode. It is really cool though with the old and new movies plus the icons are really cool. They have like iron Man and r2d2. If you aren’t a fan of Disney I do not recommend it, because then it isn’t worth it. I really recommend it for Disney fans. My biggest problem is the continue watching part. 👍👍"
2019-11-19 18:29:38,Love Disney+ so far,4,Willthespaceace,False,"So far I really like Disney+, but there are a couple of features that need to be added. One feature is a way to continue watching. I started watching Star Wars the clones wars and every time I go to continue watching it starts me back at the beginning of the series. So I have to remember where I left off. 
Another feature that should be added is are like and dislike buttons. Just because I watched a show or movie doesn’t mean I enjoyed it. And if I didn’t enjoy it why should you recommend something else based on the thing I didn’t like."
2019-11-13 08:01:06,It’s...got...everything,5,Khavenger,False,"If you can think of a property that Disney owns, it’s on Disney plus. I was so shocked to find tv shows from old Disney channel from when I was a kid. 2000s shows like Suite Life, That’s So Raven, Kim Possible, and even older shows from the 90s that weren’t supposed to be there showed up, like Gargoyles, DuckTales (old and new), Chip n Dale rescue rangers, and like all the 90s marvel cartoons. Yes, you can watch the X-Men animated series(Which one? All of them) on Disney+. If they keep all these titles year round and release more this is easily worth the 6.99 per month."
2019-11-13 00:35:03,"Launch day hiccups aside, amazing app and content",5,atconleyd,False,"Launch day started with several errors and glitches. However, once all the links were worked out... Wow! This is my new favorite streaming service. I love Star wars, and being able to watch all of the movies and shows whenever I want is amazing. Additionally, some of their other content, including Disney classics, Pixar, and marvel, just keeps bringing you back for more. The app is well designed, clean and creative. I look forward to future content and the world of Disney"
2020-05-30 01:20:34,Very frustrating experience.,3,nichollspete,False,Would it kill you to let us watch the credits? Would it kill you to to just remember which user was chosen the last time the Disney+ Apple TV app was opened?!? Would it kill you to at least give us more control over the media we’re paying to watch? Let us turn off credits hijacking. How about a setting that lets the same user open the app that closed it? It’s little things like this that are so very unlike old school TV watching that kind of ruin my experience. And do you have to prime us for binge watching? You have our money already.  Just let us watch TV.
2020-04-27 18:04:05,Great app but one problem,5,Zanyzooming,False,Brother bare whenever I try to watch it on my tv screen or on my iPhone it always seems to be in window mode and that annoys me immensely. I’ve tried redownloading it a couple of times but it still looked windowed. So if any of the creators of the all can fix that that be great I’d love to watch the movie in full screen and not the stupid windowed mode. But either then that 10/10 app can watch most of the Disney movies I haven’t seen yet or watch something I haven’t seen in a while
2020-02-19 01:51:38,Headaches,2,spababy1230,False,I downloaded this app because everyone was saying that’s better then Netflix but omg this app doesn’t let you finish watching the movie do to errors. At first I thought it was my internet but it’s not. There hasn’t been a movie where I can say I enjoyed watching it with out any interruptions. The movie stops so often that I rewind or fast forward or try to close the app and start again but the movie continues to stop. There has not been a movie that I say I have enjoyed die to the streaming all the time. Netflix at least let’s you watch movies with out the streaming errors.i just canceled my subscription due to the movies and shows always buffering.
2019-12-27 05:13:48,I LOVE THIS APP,5,avneth,False,This is the best app me and my brother ever had there is many movies and my mom is happy cause everything is for kids and all the movies are there and series I’m just having one thing if I switch the language in my account all the other do and I’m trying to watch a series that is in Spanish but all the other accounts get in Spanish my brother only speaks English so I would really like Disney+ to fix that but everything else is greatttt you should definitely download it and is not expensive at all
2019-12-17 14:04:18,"Premium cost, subpar treatment.",1,LupoMD,False,The app is clumsily developed. For a service that charges an expensive premium and was known about for a very long time this app feels like it’s in beta.  I couldn’t even stream it without constant freezing and bugs. Refuses to play episodes continually and worst of all it’s got so many restrictions on where I can  “cast” it even though if I really wanted to I could anyway it’s just these things that hinder people wanting to pay for them. The very worst part is when I brought this up during my first month Disney showed zero concern and asked me when I would consider renewing.  They need to seriously cut the price down or fix everything. You can’t even continue watching! There’s no option for it!
2019-12-07 16:53:30,Where are all the titles I signed up for?,1,Xi is a Genocidal Dictator,False,"Don’t put titles on my screen if contacts keep me from being able to watch it for an entire year. Like, you expect me to keep your service for a year to watch movies that should be included already? How many times have my kids pointed at what show they want to watch only to be told nope! Disney owns the rights to everything but somehow can’t provide its own content on its dedicated streaming service? 

And no MCU Spider-Man? Limited Avengers? YOU OWN MARVEL. GET THE MOVIES ON THERE. I am going to unsubscribe and pirate all your movies just so it’s one less person lining your CCP supporting pockets, and hey, I’ll get to actually watch the movies I want. Way to go, Disney. I can’t wait to watch you burn to the ground from your own stupidity."
2019-11-21 23:34:00,Please add a “keep watching” list,5,Fazberry0987,False,"I think the app is great and I like it a lot, but I really wish there was a keep watching list. This is because I watch a lot of shows at once, and sometimes it’s hard to keep track of. For example, on Netflix I am watching a lot of shows, and when I go on Netflix I know what I’ve been watching right when I log in because all the things I’m watching are right at the top of the list. It would be great if you could add this and be much more convenient for people."
2019-11-19 01:03:08,"Great service, but some things aren’t available yet.",4,Gregory Hess,False,"I got this service on launch day and so far I really like it. The selection of movies and tv shoes are awesome. However, when you’re browsing the catalog you’ll find more then one time that you’ll go to watch certain things, but they’re not available yet. Some things won’t be available until as far as early 2021! My guess as to why they did this is because they wanted their catalog to look bigger then it actually is. It’s very annoying and makes this service look quite perceptive."
2019-11-16 13:28:29,One Problem,4,NalaMoo4008,False,"I think that Disney+ is a great app and I even have it on my tv but there’s one thing that makes me angry.. There is not a continue watching or currently watching list. Another thing is, it doesn’t even save the spot you were at!! I was watching a movie the other day and then I had to leave and so I turned of the tv. I come back and don’t remember where I left off so I had to fast forward through the whole movie trying to figure out where I left off. In all I think Disney+ is a great app but I do think there could be improvements. Thank you."
2019-11-16 12:57:29,"Great, but should have waited.",4,BigE12345678910,False,"Disney has almost all of their movies on here. The other ones are still on Netflix and other various streaming services because they have a contract with these other companies to have them on there. They have stated that once the contracts are up with the other services, they will move the remaining movies and what not to Disney+. In my opinion, Disney should have waited to launch Disney+ until they had all the movies in their possession. But over all, most of the movies, TV shows, and short films are on Disney+ so it’s not a bad choice for a Disney fan!"
2019-11-15 03:39:55,Only a couple of things are missing,4,Angus&Nutteebutter,False,"So I’m pretty much in love with this app. It’s got all of my favorite tv shows as a kid, as well as Disney Channel original movies that I honestly thought I would never see again. There are only a couple of things that i feel would make it better is if there was a continue watching section, so when I stop after an episode or I stop halfway It’s easy for me to get to it and a little white line at the bottoms of episodes to see which ones I have watched would be great as well. I’m excited to see what new updates bring!"
2020-09-26 03:15:52,Profiles for kids,4,jonnybl730,False,"I am really enjoying the Disney+ app. My only issue is with the set up of profiles. We set up a profile for my daughter to watch on an iPad, her profile is great and only allows her to watch shows that are approved by my wife or myself. The problem is that she can change to my profile or my wife’s at will, so we will catch her watching “The Simpsons’” or shows that are generally not age appropriate. It would be nice to be able to set the child profiles with a “lock” so they can’t just go to a profile that isn’t appropriate."
2019-11-14 04:01:08,Error,1,JV0360,False,"No joke I was super excited about this app and even went ahead a purchased a year of it, 2 days app working great no issues started watching the sweet life on deck great show taking me back to my childhood, 3rd day app keeps saying I’m not connected to the internet, I thought it was glitching so I uninstalled it and reinstalled, nope not it’s saying my account has error, so I go to the website lol it WONT EVEN LOAD TO THE LOG IN SCREEN!!!!!!!!!! And that’s not even mentioning the customer support I’ve been on hold for life chat for half an hour and earlier today I was on hold on the phone for a hour before calling it quits, so disappointing Disney 😢 what type of app are you running where it’ll work to charge people’s cards but got give them service!!!!"
2019-11-14 00:36:07,Amazing!!,5,kbutters11,False,"The classics, the shows & movies I LIVED through as a preteen, I LOVE everything about Disney+ 
It was so easy to download on both my phone, Roku TV & FireStick! (FireStick was the easiest, it connected me through the phone app.)
Only a couple suggestions; a continue watching section on the homepage would be convenient & automatically picking up where I left off on a show when clicking play vs starting from the 1st episode again and having to click through the episodes to remember where I was 
But honestly, I LOVE it!"
2020-09-22 01:05:32,Missing a key component and movies,4,Toebug08,False,"I’m pleasantly surprised at how well Disney + is doing. It’s awesome. Everything I look for in a streaming service. However there’s no start over feature when watching a previously started movie. I’d rather just watch from the beginning instead of picking up where I left off. Also 2 feature films are missing from the Disney library, Make Mine Music and Ralph Breaks the Internet. I thought you were supposed to have all the feature films there. Cmon Disney, let’s get it done please. Other than those qualms, I love it."
2020-08-09 17:51:06,Just a few bugs,4,TD-0813,True,There are just a few minor inconvenience that effect my watching experience and should be fixed. When watching something then trying to rewind and fast forward only works about once or twice before it stops. It makes it harder for me to use the scroll bar if I don’t need to go that far. Also the recommended for you section needs a new algorithm or something because it is everything I’ve already watched. I wish it would actually recommend something i haven’t watched.
2020-04-06 00:07:53,One little issue,4,skrskrpullupaturmumahohse,False,The whole app in total is pretty cool 😎 your just in your room watching it on your phone and  chilling but sometimes I want to go to a Disney show but when I do it’s working good and all but they never update the episodes if that show makes more episodes Disney+ doesn’t have them so when a show is made Disney+ adds it and say the show has two seasons and that show updates then they add a season Disney+ doesn’t add it too so I ask that you do a update for the whole app that updates the shows and stuff like that thank you
2020-04-04 09:11:51,Error 41,4,Tbruni,False,"I love Disney. I have always been a big fan, and when I heard that they had bought the rights to movies like Anastasia, I was ecstatic. I searched to see if it was on Disney Plus (because sadly I know over 400 movies and shows are missing from the app) and it said it was! I clicked on the link and as it was loading, it said there was an error. Something that had to do with error 41. I was really bummed. Any reason why it did that? Or why over 400 of Disney owned items are not on the app? If anyone could give and answer it would be much appreciated. 
Thank you"
2019-12-17 22:15:22,Great app,4,#love puppiesu,False,"I love the app, and it has all my favorite movie from when I was younger. I problem is that it drains my battery super quickly and it makes my phone take longer to charge. Usually when I wake up it the morning, and my phone is at 100% and when I get back home from school it would be like 70%, now though when I get home it’s at 10%. My phone is also taking longer to charge because my phone would only take like 10 minutes to get to 50% but now it takes longer other than those 2 problems it’s a great app."
2020-01-05 23:12:16,Great catalogue but apply still need A LOT of fixes,3,thejenniferstone,False,"Great content, great catalogue; no complaints there. I’m so glad that the continue watching feature was added in the last update, that was a huge positive. The problem is the watchlist. It cuts off, half of the stuff that I added to the watch list doesn’t show up at all and when I swipe up to load more titles it just re upload the same 20-ish titles that I just went through. when I search the title it show the “+” like I didn’t add it at all and a definitely did. Dealing with the watch list is a headache with these issues. Please fix these problems ASAP."
2019-12-08 21:21:05,"Good content, needs better interface design & streaming issues",4,Tejlee123,False,"Pros- Good content, daily well organizing categories
Issues- Chromecasting is hit or miss, which is frustrating. I’ve checked other apps and for some reason, get the most inconsistency with the Disney app. Sometimes I can cast, sometimes I can’t. Also, if I’m watching a show, I can’t just click the show title and change the episode. I can either continue the episode or re-search for the show, find it, and then select the episode I want to watch. Needs better user interface design."
2019-11-16 21:51:19,Two things missing.,4,frankieb12,False,"Other than those the app is great. I love watching these things that are not usually on. The first thing people have talked about. It’s the continue watching thing. When I watch a show and go back to it, it either brings me to the start of the season, or brings be the a random point of the episode. Hope that gets addressed. The second thing is a show request. I was looking for a Disney XD show callers mighty med, and it wasn’t on there. It was one of my favorite shows and hope that it could be added. I’m 99% sure it’s made by Disney. Thanks"
2019-12-02 22:17:34,Amazing App if it always worked..,3,ejacks19,False,"Everything about this app is awesome. So many movies and shows to watch! Only issue is that on the FireStick a lot of the HD movies won’t play properly. When an HD movie is selected it’ll either play the movie but you can’t pause it or rewind without the screen staying black, or the movie won’t play at all, and when it’s selected I can hear the audio but the screen is black. It seems the only way to fix this problem is to uninstall the app, and then reinstall it and log in all over again. Seriously hoping they come out with an update that fixes this problem.."
2019-11-16 21:18:47,Great first version,4,AZS_1993,False,"I love the app. Clean, easy to use and lots of search categories. A couple things is there needs to be a  currently watching tab. Something to go back to if you didn’t finish an episode or movie. Right now you have to search the show or movie or go to your watch list and pick the episode or movie  and then fast forward. The other thing is that with TV shows it needs to automatically role forward to the next episode. 

Great app, I’m glad it’s finally here and I’m sure these improvements will be pushed in later developments."
2019-11-14 22:40:53,Missing some things,4,Rachellee21,False,"I love Disney. And I was beyond excited when Disney+ came out. But it needs some minor changes... (why it isn’t five stars)
I wish there was like a watch recently list so I don’t have to research for a show. Also I wish there was a way to see what episodes you have already watched. When I get into a marathon I want to see how far I am or if I go back to a show I want to see where I left off. But don’t get me wrong I love the platform and I know that these are things that change once it’s been up a while. Forever will be a Disney fan though."
2019-11-14 19:50:11,Love!,4,Robertson 9999,False,"I personally don’t have many complaints about this app I love it and think they will make great money off of it! One think I do think they should look into updating is a “continue watching” option. Unless I’m just looking in the wrong area. For example. Yesterday I downloaded the app and started watching Hannah Montana when I was done I just exited the app. I went to continue watching it today and had to look the show up or go to my watchlist where it then started the show all over. 
Other than that I love the app and will enjoy hours of Disney everyday!"
2019-11-14 14:26:05,Rough on the edges but overall good,4,vintagetech,False,"Edit: Desperately needs a continue watching card as well as indicators of what episodes I watched already. Every other streaming service I use can doe this, Disney should be able to as well.

Been waiting a long time for this. App certainly has some day 1 issues and bugs but overall is worth it. Profile editing has bugs and not all content is showing up in the lists, one show hung and had to restart, but otherwise it has been working fine. Been enjoying a bunch of classic and new Disney shows."
2020-10-20 01:24:20,"Love it, but...",4,Nolan Crawdad,False,"So I love Disney+, it has all my favorite shows and movies. I can watch anytime and anything. Me and my family watch it on our tv all the time. I got it one my ipad and was excited to use it when i was on road trips, but i started using it today, and when i start watching something, at any random time it kicks me out of the app, then i have to go back in, wait for it to load, and then start whiting it again. And it does not happen ones in a show, it happens all the time! I don’t know if it’s just me, bit it’s annoying."
2019-11-13 07:21:36,Needs fixing ASAP,2,TruePanda,False,"Okay so I’ve been registered for this app since early September. My friend registered merely hours before the app launched. He got into the app perfectly fine, here I am nearly 24 hours later and I still can’t even log in without the app redirecting me to customer service. I realize every app has its bugs at launch, but a problem that’s so bad that I can’t even access the account I own that’s being charged monthly is ridiculous. Using my friend’s login, I was able to see what the app has to offer and it met my expectations. Once I can actually get into the service, I’ll bump my review up to 5 stars. Just please fix these blinding issues as soon as possible."
2020-09-26 13:22:51,Needs more Tv Series,3,TruD@T,False,"First, I hate the scrolling to the right - to only reveal one new show at a time. Waist of my time.  A positive this may be the first service to not duplicate shows in each category to fake that it has more shows than it does. Last, I am borderline consider canceling because there is nothing to binge watch, there are mostly movies and nothing to keep my kiddos entertained while I make dinner.  After the first few months we have watched and rewatched the movies they like and now I may think it would be cheaper to buy the movies unless they start to release tv series the kiddos may like."
2020-07-06 06:15:58,Mixed Feelings,3,clbfroggie,False,"PARENTAL CONTROL-There needs to be a feature that allows adult profiles to be locked so kids can’t switch between them and access adult content. Many other services provide this. 

CRASHES/BUFFERING-I have yet to make it through any show or movie without it buffering or saying “something went wrong, try again later”. This is exceptionally frustrating. I even have this issue watching Pixar shorts. Initially, I thought it was my own wireless service, but it’s exclusive to this streaming service. 

AWESOME SELECTIONS-I love the fact that there is so much content and more is being added. It’s great to have it all available in one place that can be easily accessed. 

PROFILE ABILITY-After implementing passcodes, I would love to see the ability to select content based on G, PG, etc. and Youth ratings.  My older child loves some of the documentaries, but they’re not featured in the child profile option. Yet, there is still content on the adult profile that isn’t appropriate."
2019-12-11 22:15:28,Fix the watchlist problem,4,Josh Helmers,False,"So I’ve been using Disney+ since it launched & it’s great!! The only real issue I have is that not everything I added to my watchlist appears on it. There’s several shows & movies that I added and it shows they were added, but they don’t show up in my watchlist. I even tried deleting everything out of my watchlist and starting it from scratch. But no, that didn’t fix the problem.
It’s just kind of frustrating when you go to look for something you added to your watchlist and it’s not there."
2020-04-01 05:08:22,Just wow!,5,cute ovo,False,"This is the best app for movies I’ve ever seen, I can watch any Disney or Pixar movie! Such great quality and contains many movies I like, for example, Lady and the Tramp! Me and my sister fell in love with the app! But there is one thing they should do. They should allow Disney+ to connect to tv’s, my tv or my moms tv doesn’t have it sadly, maybe connect Disney+ to all type of TV’s!
Another thing is the internet, but that is understandable, ofc the internet doesn’t work all the time, but I’m used to it! I rate this app 10/10 five star!"
2020-03-30 18:44:57,It can get a little annoying,2,mary popmina,False,"When I am watching Disney+ I really enjoy it. But if my iPad is not on lock it flips right side up and half of the screen is the show I am watching when it should be full screen. So every time I go on Disney+ I have to turn my iPad sideways and lock it. Or when I exit of Disney + and it brings me to my homepage there is a little square where the show is that’s pretty cool. But when I tap on it I press the open up button and it kicks me out of the whole app, or it brings me to Disney+ but then only has a little corner where the show is playing, and behind it, it says video is playing in picture when it should be full screen."
2020-02-20 01:24:28,Needs some work,5,NibrocE_03,False,"I love this app. There’s so many great shows and movies, and I can watch them whenever I want. However, sometimes while I’m watching the volume will go from normal to quiet, then loud, the normal again. It’s an endless cycle of me having to turn the volume up and down. If this was fixed my experience on the app would be much more delightful. With that in mind I would still like to say that I highly recommended this app to anyone who loves anything Disney. It’s got new shoes, and the Disney classics."
2020-02-10 02:16:47,Amazing,5,Wolf Lover345,False,I’m really happy that this app exists because there is so many Disney movies I haven’t seen or movies that I just love and wanna see again. Disney+ has no problems what so ever on my phone nor Tv I think it’s a wonderful app with plenty of movies to watch with family and friends. But it would be neat if you added Universal Studios to Disney+ since you do have Marvel and Pixar and much more why not add Universal Studios? This is just a suggestion I think it would be a tiny bit better but you do what you want!
2020-02-04 12:25:52,My account was hacked,1,Izzylark1,False,"The Disney plus app was nice while it lasted. It took no longer than a month before my account was hacked. Disney sent me an email saying that my account had been updated when I never changed anything. I went to the app and all of the words had been changed to Spanish but my email was still correct. I was then forced and logged out of my account and could not log in with the same email. When I called the help center, they proceeded to tell me that my email no longer belonged to me and that they were not able to help me with my issue. They kept saying “Disney takes our security very seriously!”, well apparently not because I no longer have access to my account."
2020-01-10 19:51:57,Garbage app,1,Zhinii1,False,"Frustrating with all these ridiculous errors. Was just using it last night just fine till morning comes, then all of a sudden error 83 decides to screw everything up. You’d think a company that owns half the world would come up with a decent app with little to no problems.

EDIT: I’ve done some tweaking and have discovered that I cannot access my login via App OR the website if I am using my own WiFi. I can only access if I am using my mobile data. I have done all possible solutions by deactivating my router, deleting the app, restarting my phone etc. all to no avail. This is a JavaScript error, meaning this is on Disney+. I will not change my IP address for this app nor will I contact my ISP. This is ridiculous."
2019-12-17 04:32:52,Bug fixes,2,FLBP!,False,"I so badly wanted to rate higher. But as it is now, the product is riddled with bugs. Right now I tried watching the latest Imagineering episode and it freezes every 5 minutes and skips ahead. I have to rewind to get it to play regularly. Finally it just quit working altogether. When I tried switching back to my cable, the home screen of Disney + was so laggy that I couldn’t switch. Right now I just tried during Disney + on and it’s a black screen. Nothing will load. Why did I pay for something I can’t use? Need to fix or start prorating users for times it won’t work. This isn’t a problem with Netflix or prime and Disney has most advanced tech? Hm."
2019-11-16 01:04:05,No “continue watching” feature 😣,4,pieceofB,False,"If you start binge watching a show, be sure to remember where you left off because Disney+ will not indicate which season/episode you left off on. Although when you eventually find the episode you’re on it will pick up where you left off on that particular episode. 

Other than that, the app is great! I hope they release special watch lists such as a Christmas/holiday list or maybe a list of the Marvel MCU movies in the order they came out OR in the order that makes most chronological sense."
2019-12-04 01:57:32,Abysmal customer service,1,BettyWhiteOverdrive,False,This service was not working on my laptop or roku so i decided to give contacting customer service a try. When i tried to live chat on my phone I waited for over 30 minutes to talk to somebody... for over ten of those minutes it said my wait time was under one minute. Then I chatted with a rep for over an hour and my issue was not resolved. The agent told me that he would escalate the issue and i would hear back. That didn’t happen. When i called a couple days later i was told that it was t even a possibility to escalate... so there was no way that would’ve ever happened. This customer service is truly terrible and they don’t have appropriate troubleshooting and escalation procedures in place.
2019-11-27 12:43:35,You won’t regret it.,5,Maarriiaannnaaa,False,"Absolutely love the Disney+ app. Don’t question your decision you’ll love it. It’s perfect for the kids and perfect for you when you feel like taking a trip to your childhood. Best part, they finally added a continue watching feature 😂 i can finally keep track of everything i watch! They have many many hidden gems that I completely forgot existed. Netflix is still my #1 because of the diversity. But, As for all things Disney. Nothing beats this app. Best gift I’ve seen in 2019"
2019-11-22 18:34:17,Won’t let you end a subscription,1,kawaiitoons,False,"I tried to get the Disney plus bundle and once I found out my dad had already did it I tried to cancel mine but the option was never available under billing info. I have been on the wait call for over 20 minutes now and haven’t spoken to anyone. All I’m trying to do is cancel my subscription before the 7 days is up. For such a huge company it’s disgraceful that you would try to trap someone in a subscription. It’s Friday passed noon so there is no reason to why I am not being processed through. You are a huge company as I’ve said so how do you not have enough people to take calls. I’ve tried to cancel my subscription on my laptop, phone and through many browsers. Won’t let me."
2019-11-18 23:17:48,Great movie and show availability but some obvious glitches and technical difficulties,2,George lucas fan,False,"Disney + is a great app idea that has promise in allowing people to watch all their favorite marvel, Star Wars or any other Disney whenever they want, but it was obviously a rushed job. One of the problems is that the screen shrinks seemingly at random and the connection in general isn’t great. It’s also annoying how few movies are actually shown at first. You can find all the ones you’re looking for if you know exactly what you’re looking for. All in all Disney + is a good idea, but the execution is a poor imitation of Netflix and could be so much better if Disney put some decent effort and time into the project."
2019-11-18 00:03:34,Missing stories,3,Jb0mb00$,False,"I want to know why if it’s a Disney App: with Pixar, National Geographic, Marvel, Star Wars. Why aren’t there any Disney XD shows like Star vs the Forces of evil, Randy Cunningham 9th Grade Ninja, Motorcity, Jimmy 2 shoes or Kid vs Kat? Also for Marvel, if the MCU bought rights from Fox then why it’s Deadpool/Deadpool 2or any of the X-Men movies or Fantastic 4 movies but the Simpsons are on here? Then for the SpiderMan Collection why is every other SpiderMan series in there but Spectacular SpiderMan nor any SpiderMan movies?
Since having the app it seems Disney only put the most popular or newest version of shows & movies on Disney + instead of all Disney owned shows or shows/movies owned or related to the different categories on Disney +!!"
2020-04-01 12:54:39,Worth the money .,4,Mamwmskskwmwme,False,"I was so excited when they came out with Disney plus. I love being able to watch shows I loved when I was a child or teen! The only thing I would change is I would like it to play the episode after usually I half to press okay button on the remote and it gets annoying . 
I would also like to see more Disney shows on the app. Examples - liv and Maddie , dog with the blog, ant farm,  Austin and alley , higgley town hero’s . Any show that’s ever been on Disney really .  And it should have all episodes and seasons . I love the app and would recommend it."
2019-11-12 11:53:25,So much content even at launch!,5,gandore2427,False,"For those reviews below that mentioned some content not available: Some providers like Netflix, Starz and HBO have a contract for some of Disney’s content. It will eventually expire and land on Disney+. The same goes for movies that have recently been in theaters. Disney will continue to have their blockbuster (major money making) movies in theaters as long as possible before landing on Disney+ (i.e. Live Action Aladdin, Frozen II, etc.) 
In the meantime, there is plenty of content to last years, with more to come!"
2020-05-12 14:33:56,Childish Child Restrictions,1,benhenmal02,False,"I am 17 years old, but I work and earn money. With my money I purchased a Disney plus account for the whole family. I’ve been using my account since November. Today, arbitrarily, I was locked out of my account because I am a minor. No notification was given, just an encouragement to call the help desk. Only once I’ve contacted the help desk was I blessed with the understanding of why I’d been locked out of my account. I hate to complain. I love Disney. Growing up, we’d go to Disney World all the time. Just seriously?? If you’re going to add restrictions you need to also add explanations of those restrictions. That’s just common sense. If you get this app, you will enjoy it... unless they decide to take it from you."
2020-04-27 12:37:25,So so,5,Texas Twin Mommy,False,"For the most part the app works fine. I have come across a handful of movies where the audio cuts in and out or completely starts over 3/4 of the way through the movie. Annoying the audio doesn’t match the video and we can’t finish the movie. 
The app on our Visio TV doesn’t work at all. I have to cast from my phone to the TV to watch Disney Plus. Real annoying that I can’t use the built in app on the TV. 
I do like how all 6 members in the house can have their own profile."
2020-02-10 23:08:12,Good not great,3,LoganPW,False,"Good streaming service, not great. Two issues right now I’m noticing:
1. When watching downloaded movies offline, if you pause the movie, you won’t be able to pause the movie a second time. You get a rendering icon instead. Frustrating 
2. When finished with a movie, instead of removing it from your continue watching list, the movie remains there. It should be taken off automatically or least give me a way to manually remove it from the list so that it doesn’t get clogged with movies I’ve already finished. 

It’d be great to get these issues taken care of Disney Plus team. Thanks"
2020-01-29 05:39:31,Decent but downloads are pointless,3,Rucksack 3/75,False,"Overall the app works pretty good and many of the bugs have been fixed. However, downloads no longer work without an internet connection which defeats the purpose of downloading. Unfortunately a lot of the time that I am able to watch is time that I don’t have any internet so it was great before being able to download and watch later but lately every time I attempt to watch my videos without internet I get an error message so I just have to watch Netflix instead.  I hope that they are able to resolve this issue soon."
2019-12-15 18:17:34,Great app needs more payment options,4,grimmwhofan87,False,"Great app and I love it. I love the fact I can watch shows from when I was a kid like Darkwing Duck and Gargoyles and the 90s Xmen and Spider-Man series. However it would be great if there were more payment options other than PayPal and credit cards. It would be great if they accepted Disney gift cards (it is a Disney product after all) or even visa/MasterCard gift cards, or if they gave you the option to pay through your apple/android account. Until they do something like this I will not be using the app and not reactivating my account"
2019-12-28 19:05:25,I love it,5,Loin heart,False,Love it live it love it love it love it. Hello hi hello I love to see your dad is the time I wanna is your birthday and I’m sorry to miss that I hope you’re doing good I’m going home now bye hello bye love ya daddy was the day I got home I wanna is your day love ya bye ya know how much you wanna love ya bye ya know how to get to the thunder bro lol lol love you too much bye ya ya bye bye hello hi hi bye bye hello hi bye hello bye ya hello hi hello bye ya hello bye hello hi hi bye hello bye hi hi bye bye hello hi hi bye bye ya bye bye hello hello bye ya know what you mean by now you can i is this time of my life and my life I will have a great day at home and I’m not going home because my parents don’t want me to go home and bye
2019-11-19 13:54:26,Great app but missing one feature,4,DominicanTaz,False,"Love the layout of the movies and anime. Easy to move around look for what you want to watch but it’s missing to be able to select replay on the series. My daughter loves Mickey Mouse club house and when you select to play it would keep going to the next and next until I reach to the last episode she hasn’t watched. 

I would love to see at least last watched episode and if someone would or haven’t seen let’s say that episode you have seen to be able to select replay. Other then that it’s good."
2019-11-17 15:30:30,I love this app❤️🥰😍,4,peaches 1029,False,I love this app it’s the best thing that came out that i can teach my son that there’s more to these new shows but i wish they had a continue to watch feature to where i can watch it where i left off plus a as all the movies that was once on there an that been out for some time aren’t on there this is not a hate comment or anything i would just like to know when are the other updates coming to the app i just wish more features was introduced in the beginning but love the app brings back so many memories
2019-11-18 17:34:12,I already love this app,5,Panda19902008,False,"I love this app already. I have no complaints. 
But I do have a couple of ideas: a resume play for a movie you paused and left after a while. For shows I really hope they bring back the classic. I remember an Aladdin series, jungle book kids. Some movies (the classic Beauty and the Beast for example) have a “deleted” song (Human again was the song) I was thinking a select button to choose if we would like to watch the extended movie version or the original version."
2019-11-14 16:35:05,A lot of glitches and other things,4,XIIIRoxasKeyblades,False,I will give this a solid 4 stars because of the glitches involving playback where the video stutters but the audio continues playing. The extra star could be earned back if you guys fix this while adding a recently added category as well.  Could you guys also fix the order of the episodes of Ducktales 2017?  The 1st and 2nd episodes of Season 1 are in the 3rd and 4th episode slot and the order of Season 2 is so scrambled that I have to use Wikipedia to figure out what episodes are in correct chronological order.
2020-06-20 02:00:48,Streaming Through Chromecast Issues,4,TobyWong29,False,"I love this app so far. Would have given it 5 stars, but a few issues prevented me. First, when streaming through my Chromecast, shows and movies do not stream in 5.1 Dolby Digital (DD) even though they state they do. I have checked all settings on my home theater system and have tried other streaming apps with no issues with those apps streaming 5.1 DD. Second, when I link to my Chromecast, and try to resume a movie or show, the show or movie starts over every time I try to resume it. Please fix these issues!"
2019-11-12 18:53:56,So far so good,5,Obed2010,False,"I’m pleasantly surprised by Disney+! I’m not a fan of the new Star Wars films or what’s being done to the Marvel movies, but decided to give this a try for Mandalorian and the upcoming Obi-Wan series. The app runs perfectly for me so far and the movie selection is pretty good. I hope the selection improves to include more adult  monster/thriller/sci-fi type movies in the future, since Disney basically owns them all now. Mandalorian was excellent, btw! If you have kids or are a Disney movie buff, this service is a no-brainer.  So far, Disney+ is a 5 star steaming service."
2020-07-02 21:58:06,"Not worth it , can’t even sign up",1,John23bro,False,"I’ve tried to sign up for Disney plus on my iPhone 11 Pro Max and I Enter my email and a password to sign up and it brings me to a “call this number for support” so I call the number and the robot on there tells me it will take up to 10 minutes so I waited and nobody answered I waited for 25+ minutes and still no answer from support I’m really disappointed in their customer service I also tried the 1 on 1 chat customer service and I had to wait 8 minutes when I was messaging the lady I told her what happened and she said “oh, no” and “I will help with that” so I waited and she didn’t do anything with helping I sat there for nothing. Waste of my time. Don’t even bother with this app."

2020-05-04 12:21:06,"Bad Streaming App, good content",1,Susa Elle Sunshine,False,"Although this app has many mistakes (spelling errors in desc, episodes being off like episode 1 is actually episode 15) it does have good content when it is working. One of the issues I had with it is theyre choice of what shows get added on, and which don't. Lab rats was added, BUT they included the episode of lab rats and mighty med crossover, and since they don't have mighty med in the app, you only watch part 1 and can't watch the other one. When asked about this they said it might be a region issue, but for a show created in the US? That's a very strange response to give anyone. And if it's about deals they made, why not add it and give the time it shows up like they did with infinity war?"
2020-05-01 05:19:06,Desperately needs fixed.,2,frustratedmom0827,False,I have had this app since it came out like most people. My 6 year old daughter loves it and I love it half the time smh. I stopped paying for this after always with the rotating circle would stop me from watching anything then it finally kicking me out. Saying sorry there was an error. They want to blame the WiFi but everything else works flawless and fine with no issues. I decided to give it another chance because it is amazing and has so many options and makes me feel like a kid again but they really need to fix this cuz it’s garbage and is enough to make to stop using it again. It is ridiculous smh.
2020-02-08 02:10:57,Loving this app😁😁😁,5,💜💙LOVER FOR MUSIC💙💜,False,"I suggest this to anyone who likes movie you get one year free but that is only Acording Sometimes you will find that you get only one month of disney plus this is something that is able to add on a tv I would say this app can get kids less screen time and more family time this does not include  horror movies you can get this on phone , tablet different lectronics this also has princess movies the newest lion king,pirates of the Caribbean 1 out of 10 I am gonna go for 10 good luck"
2020-01-23 19:25:52,App issues,3,AndyofATX,False,"Glad to use the app and have the movies and shows available but the app on Apple TV and on my phone has so many issues. 

Today I was watching a movie and clicked out of it. Even though the movie wasn’t playing and I was scrolling through the menu the audio for the movie kept going. Won’t stop. Can’t figure out how to get the audio to stop playing for a movie I’m not watching. Even when starting another movie, audio plays over another movie. Even tried logging out, audio kept playing. Then couldn’t log back in even though password was correct because I wrote it done. Even the phone verify log in wouldn’t work. 

Seems every other day there’s some type of problem with it. Couldn’t use it at all two days ago for no reason just said the app couldn’t load or there was some connectivity issue even though every other app worked. 

Disney needs to get there developers to fix the increasing issues."
2019-12-08 04:56:28,Disney half a plus,4,gdykdoyshclhd,False,"I think that this app is wonderful but there is one flaw. Beauty and the Beast irl only shows the trailer. If it is really a Disney app, it should have all the real Disney movies including the ones that have recently come out. If we are paying a lot of money for an app, we should get all we deserve. Disney would be very disappointed if we don’t get to see ALL the movies that they have made. That would be very bad for the app and no one wants an app that doesn’t do what it was meant to do. I think y’all can do much better than that."
2019-12-02 20:31:25,Looooove,4,makayy26,False,"Love the app and all the shows/movies!! Taking me back through my childhood for sure. Only two issues I have been having with the app is 1. When I add shows/movies to my “Watchlist”, it disappears after watching one episode or even without watching it. I like to have a list so that it’s easy to navigate to what I’d like to watch but so much falls off the list that I’m constantly always having to re-add things to my list. 2. On the ps4 the app has had a bunch of trouble force closing. It’d also be great if they’d add Proud Family show, not just the movie."
2019-11-18 02:06:07,They have some work to do.,4,stageart,False,"My family loves the channel. Our biggest complaint is it does not show you which episodes you have watched and it does not have a resume key. We have young children and limit their TV time and sometimes stop shows in the middle of a show. We often only let them have one or two at a time, so it is helpful to know which show they watched last. Since, they like quite a few different shows I can not tell which was the last one they watched.
I hope Disney fixes this quickly."
2019-11-30 21:06:29,Absolutely love it but...,3,raeleighaa,False,"When I use Disney plus on my PS4 I have a various of problems. The first few days I used it(disney+), it was great! But the past few days I can’t even get through a episode! Everything I try to watch, from shows to movies the screen will buffer then stop with the audio still playing.... when I try and exit out, it does the same exact thing. I’ve even tried disconnecting my internet and trying iit again like that but it’s the same issues. I love the idea of this and I love watching all my old favorites shows and movies but I wish I didn’t have to go through this😪"
2019-11-18 19:29:26,Released too soon?,3,Phouse83,False,"We got Disney+ for the Marvel and Star Wars media and it hasn’t disappointed there. That’s worth 3 stars right there. 
What’s missing are some really basic streaming service features. A watch list that is easily accessible from the top screen as well as a “continue watching” feature. Additionally, watched movies and episodes aren’t marked so you have to go back through each I social show season and find where you left off. 
Not binge friendly. 
I imagine that Disney’s knee-jerk reaction to put out the platform now has more to do with a severe case of FOMO. Makes me appreciate Netflix all the more."
2019-11-18 02:01:51,Only one MAJOR issue,4,itsmik97,False,"Love the app! My childhood memories are all coming back! However, I wish that there was a “Continue Watching” section (kinda like Netflix has)! It’s kinda frustrating having to remember what episode of a show I’m on and having to search for it! Also, if I have been watching an app-only show, tell me when there is a new episode!! Frustrating when I’m watching High School Musical: The Musical: The Series...I watched the first episode and then I had NO CLUE that the second episode came out! Really annoying but fix these and Disney+ will be golden!!!"
2020-08-07 13:00:08,Good but needs work,4,highly request this app,False,"I love Disney+ takes most of my time or used to. You see me and my sisters always watch our favorite shows and movies, but since school is almost out, I won’t have time with all of my homework I should be doing on the weekends. Me and my mom have been waiting for Cinderella, Beauty and the Beast, and a couple more to come out and since I’m not in elementary anymore, I will have a lot more homework for my 8 classes and I won’t have time to watch any of the movies. Overall, I recommend this app because it’s hundreds of movies for free."
2019-11-17 18:21:42,Needs work,3,AnnieCakes30,False,"I’m okay with the content they have, although more Disney channel original movies like Model Behavior and My Date With The President’s Daughter would be great but my biggest problem with this app is that there’s no place on your home screen to continue watching a show or movie that you’ve already started but weren’t able to finish in one sitting. So I have to search for it every time I wanna continue watching something. You’d think after having so many streaming apps available to draw inspiration from, they would have done this. But leave it to Disney to not think practically"
2019-11-16 18:57:04,Disney plus,3,Sol389,False,"I really liked how you had all the shows of Disney. Also you had a lot of stuff  that weren’t just Disney. But the real bad part that I wish you guys would have Austin and ally as a show on Disney plus because my family and me use that show to bond. We love music so we always to watch music shows and movies. So I wanted me and my family to use music to bring us together. Another thing is you guys should put in season 2 and 3 of Violetta. We love it that you have season 1, but we really would like season 2 and 3 because the show is all about music and that would help. Overall the app is amazing."
2019-11-16 07:36:04,"Contents good,just need better app",3,italsam03,False,"Hey, so I enjoy the content, I just need a better interface. Make episodes im watching go to the episode im watching when i hit play, getting tired of having to scroll to find the episode i was on. Also watchlist should not be hidden in the back, it should be the first thing I see, or at the least a button to make it easier to access. Lastly let me choose an autoplay feature so i don’t have to manually select the next episode. Other than that everything looks good, i enjoy the content and the everything else about the layout doesn’t bother me that much."
2019-11-15 07:03:46,Couldn’t have expected anything better,5,Locordz,False,"I’m giving this app a 5 star review only because they went above and beyond with having so many movies and shows that I had totally forgot about but I’m glad I can watch them all over again.. the only one small thing, I wish they had a “continue to watch” tab where I can stop watching an episode and come back easily instead of remembering where I left off. But I know this is only the beginning, Thank you so much Disney."
2019-11-14 06:30:08,Love it!!,5,pdonna86,False,"So far I am in love with this app! It has all my favorite movies growing up as a kid. Yes, the app has it's glitches but come on, it was just launched, give them some slack and time to work them out! The only problem I've had so far is the buffering throughout a movie. It Could also be my internet. All in all a great idea and an awesome investment for anyone who loves Disney! Suggestion for everyone having issues; uninstall the app, wait a minute before re-downloading, restart your phone, and log back in."
2019-11-13 01:07:16,Super thrilled,5,Natbizzleeeeee,False,I am super duper happy about this! I can relieve my childhood all over again! The only thing I would say to fix would be when watching TV Series to be able to keep track on what episode we leave off on. Right now I need to figure out what episode I left off on. Maybe also add a continue watching section. Other then those two things I am obsessed and I was so happy I was off today from work for other engagements and I have been binging different old school stuff!!!!!!
2019-11-12 07:59:52,So far its ok,3,Letybg,False,"There are some pretty awesome shows up for viewing; like Darkwing Duck, Gargoyles, Huck Finn (JTT version). There’s some good looking documentaries, and some cute shorts I am looking forward to watching. They also have what looks to be all of the Marvel movies, I haven’t thoroughly checked though. 
Right now I’d have to give it 3 stars due to the fact that I kind of expected more out of Disney+. Idk I might come back to change my review after I check it out better. I think I was just expecting to see more content. Disney+ is just for Disney stuff and Netflix is for everything else (anime, cartoons, movies, shows, KDrama, novelas, documentaries, etc)."
2020-08-31 22:01:41,"good content, meh app",2,Girl On Her iPhone 8,False,"I used to love watching Disney content like Phineas and Ferb or Star Wars franchise on Netflix and when Disney took away some of my favourite Disney shows I was heart broken. 

I never wasn’t compelled to purchase a Disney subscription at first because I had heard of all of the lag issues and how it still performed like a Beta app but when I changed phone services I got a year free of Disney. 

I would like to say the only reason I may continue to stay subscribed is because of the content. 
The app itself has many problems. 

It doesn’t keep your progress through the show in series and the episodes lag out and shut the app down frustratingly often. Then you have to restart your device or delete and reload the app which is incredibly time consuming and irritating.

Other than those issues and inconveniences, the app has proven to be a great service provider especially with the offline download feature despite the downloaded content not even being reachable at times."
2020-08-27 08:50:33,Improvements,3,melanyymm,False,Don’t get me wrong the app is great....it just needs improvements. I’m not sure if there’s something wrong with my phone or it’s just the app itself but whenever look for movies and tv shows I put a checkmark for I can’t find it. It’d be great if Disney + included a “My List” category so you can easily go to the shows/movies you wanna watch. I also think they should have all the shows/movies on the same page. (When I go on the app I suddenly find new shows/movies I didn’t see before) like how come I couldn’t find them before but they just suddenly popped on my catogorys.
2020-06-27 15:46:55,Picture in Picture mode please consider!!!,4,sPoNgEBobSqPANTS,False,"First off, I love the app and I love to watch it on my iPad. Which means I can watch it pip (picture in picture). I love that feature because I can play a game or do digital art while watching Disney shows and movies. However if i am watching a show while in pip at the end of the episode instead of playing the next episode automatically it just restarts that episode. On Netflix for example it auto plays the next episode while in pip. So if possible I would love this feature to be added!!!!"
2020-06-12 00:33:11,Absolutely amazing,4,original girl 13,False,"This app is amazing I absolutely love that there are a bunch of shows to watch there are Disney movies, series and the girl asks a question clips are historical but there are a few Disney shows that aren’t on there that I would love to watch like Girl meets world and Liv and Maddie and thats the only problem for me but besides that I can watch anything Disney that I can think of so if ur a Disney fan and u got a few hours u should get this ASAP and to the people that made this ur work is stunning and I love this app so much and I appreciate what u do thank you!!!😁👍🏻😍🤩🥳"
2020-06-09 01:39:59,It’s a great app but very buggy,4,🍣SHRIMP GIRL 2607,False,I downloaded the app had it for several days and it worked great then just today I clicked on it and it kicked me out of the app and I couldn’t open the app and I turned off the iPad and tried to open the app and it still didn’t work so I deleted it in hopes that I would be able to redownload it but I couldn’t and at least every 20 minutes of watching my show it would pause go all blurry and take at least 5 minutes to load but yet I love this app and it’s very nice to have
2020-05-02 21:19:03,Great Except One Thing,4,Shawkinaw,False,"Really good app overall. Great library, great selection of Atmos and Dolby Vision content. But I watch primarily on Apple TV and also frequently use its “reduce dynamic range” function to make loud audio less loud when the kids are asleep. Every other Apple TV app lets you toggle this setting right in the app alongside audio language and subtitles. But not Disney+, I have to go all the way out to the Settings app. If you insist on having a custom video UI, Disney, at least expose this setting! (Using the standard video interface would be even better.)"
2020-06-02 20:04:52,Perfect,5,"Minecraft lover 2,000☮️",False,"I use this on my phone, iPad and also tv. My dad bought this app a couple of months ago now and I could watch anything I’d like that’s Disney :D even if I wanted to watch it when I’m supposed to do school work tehehe 🙃. This is even better than Netflix bc this has all my shows and movies. My cousin has this too so if she calls she probably wants to watch forky asks a question or idk do something even if I come over we’ll definitely watch a little of forky. Ty for reading -Eliza"
2020-05-14 22:36:07,Best thing ever!!!!,5,lil gacha_sushi,False,Dear disney i am a huge disney fan so this app has been amazing. The app is very good quality and has been amazing for quarentine. It entertains me so much and it literally has all the shows and movies ever from not only disney but from marvel etc. Thank u so much for this app. One thing that i wish it had was more marvel movies like spiderman far from home etc. But other than that This app has all my favorite shows from when i was younger and is the best thing ever. I luv it soooooo much. Thank u!
2020-04-05 00:52:41,AMAZING! 💞🤧✌🏼,5,ISJEJDHHEJENENDOWIW,False,"Alright we have to admit, this app is spectacular! As soon as I got the app I entered a whole new universe! I didn't know where to start! But I have a situation, I am not positive if it is just my tv acting weird but as soon as i start a movie, episode, etc, the camera quality isn't that good. But soon it improves! This is the only problem I have overall this app is amazing and totally worth it! I highly recommend it if your looking for something Disney, Pixar, you name it! Thank you for creating this!"
2020-03-08 09:22:21,It’s a great app!,5,Monkawekrue,False,"Hello! This app is very great, it has every Disney movie you can ever think of and I hope to see like frozen 2 on it sometime! But I would love if you can like make it like Netflix like when your watching a movie and you close the app and it’s still playing but on Netflix it plays the next episode but for Disney+ you have to close the thing you’re doing and go to the next episode, once again this is a great app! But I would love if you can fix that please! Thank you 💗💗"
2020-01-16 03:07:51,Needs lots of fixing,3,Tapas-User,False,"I never do reviews but I’m frustrated how every time I try skipping ten secs of a movie it ends up loading for a whole minute. Also when I get out of the apps without stopping it it doesn’t save where I was at or the play button gets screwed up. And finally sometimes when I tap the screen it takes me out of the movie because I was too close to the title. 
All this things are so small yet combined together while you’re trying to relax is extremely frustrating and they haven’t fixed this yet even though they’re filthy rich. They have absolutely no excuse."
2020-01-10 21:02:15,App needs work. Pushing lgbtq agenda to kids,2,Chad Htown,False,"Love the old content unlocked. Access to some great classics. The new high school musical does try to normalize lgbtq+ agenda and sways away from original kid friendly movies. My daughter loves the high school musical movie series and I found really no problems with it but, the new one is on another extreme. It opposes what Walt wanted from his brand and what I have come to expect from Disney as a parent. Walt valued keeping the innocence of children. Not putting adult issues in the content but, that is just not what we are seeing from Disney. The app has quite a few glitches. Some titles do not work at times. Buffs when I have the highest speed of internet."
2019-12-26 20:16:51,Amazing,4,FOREVER percy jackson #1fan,False,Disney+ is the best streaming app so far because you can watch ALMOST any Disney or marvel or Pixar movie or show. But I have to say that I was a little irritated when I found out that some movies and shows were not available on the app. In addition to that some shows for example Marvel’s Runaways there were two seasons out when Disney+ came out yet only one season was on the app once the third season came out there was still only one season available. Otherwise I absolutely love the app and watching all the older Disney movies and shows.
2019-11-22 16:42:45,Excellent start,4,"I'm not a critic, but...",False,"It’s a great start for Disney’s first streaming app, and it seems to have picked up features from
other apps that users like (skipping the intro is still something other apps could incorporate). The service still misses out on key elements of streaming: where is recently watched content? how much progress has been made through interrupted content? Pressing play on any series starts from the beginning S1E1 no matter how much of the series has actually been watched on the service. Overall, great start and would be epic with updates."
2019-11-29 23:02:31,I need help,3,Maria Grana,False,"Ok so I love the app, its great. Bringing back my whole childhood back. So I try to watch it all the time. My mom just payed the account and I’m trying to log in to my phone. But it keeps saying “we’re sorry, but a problem has occurred when trying to activate your subscription. Please try again later, When service is restored, your device will be activated automatically” however will my t.v it is already activated. In fact I’m watching Aladdin 1992 right now. But I need to be able to entertain my siblings while we aren’t home. So I really need to be logged in. That’s the only this I need fixed. Thanks Disney💕"
2019-11-20 19:14:36,Most bugs fixed but missing some tv series,4,zombiemouseturtle,False,"An update, most bugs with voiceover have been fixed as far as I can see. And rewinding shows is working better and restarting stuff works better since i turned off autoplay in my profile. But disney plus is missing some movies and shows. First, a movie which deserves a 5-star-rating which you are missing is Song of the South 1946 movie. Disney Plus is also missing the Aladdin tv series. And if possible please put on some of the 80s and 90s cartoons that used to come on fox kids. Thanks."
2019-11-18 07:17:18,Please Fix/Add!,4,ericaewen,False,"I love everything Disney+ offers, but like everyone else is saying, PLEASE add a, “Continue Watching” section! It’s really annoying to look for all of the shows/movies I didn’t finish. Also, when I try to watch, “Simpsons” and press play it restarts from S1E1. And there’s no indication of where I last watched (Netflix has a white bar on the episode to show you if you watched it or are halfway) so it’s annoying spending a few minutes just trying to figure out where I am on a series. Please fix these issues and it would be 5 stars!"
2019-11-18 01:56:25,Good but needs some improvements,4,Lexi Lai,False,"I would rate 5 stars but I don’t like it doesn’t have a “continue watching” option. I don’t like to continuously search for my show and even then, you have to go find what episode you left off on because if i just push play, it starts at season 1, episode 1. One last thing, I don’t like that it doesn’t automatically go to the next episode when the episode is over. Other than those small things, this is a great app for the whole family to enjoy!! I am very happy to have this app."
2019-11-15 17:28:33,Love it but need to fix some things!!!,4,p3ng1,False,"One huge thing is when you come back to the show you’ve been watching and press play, it starts back up on the very first episode instead of going to where you left off. Please get that fixed. One other thing is when you put the subtitles you have to put them on every time you start a new episode or movie. This should stay on all the time until you manually take it off. Other then that the shows and movies on it are amazing!! Just fix those two things!!!"
2019-11-17 06:54:39,Great!! But a few more things could make it a lot better,3,Thing 57,False,"I love love LOVE the selection!! Most, if not, the entire catalogue is worth watching to some degree. However, a few small things could make big differences. For example, a currently watching list would really with navigating the app. Another thing that I would really appreciate is knowing where I am in a show or movie and resuming from where I left off. These small changes I feel could make a much better experience. I give three stars because I thought that a company like Disney would think to do something like this for the launch😒"
2019-11-15 01:03:58,Loving it!,4,IG: tayylorrrpaigge,False,"I’ve been using the Disney+ app since it was released on Nov 12th and I’m absolutely loving it, I’m not experiencing any of the same problems some have. However I do have a recommendation of adding a continue watching section. It’s kinda a pain to have to go to the search feature and type in what you were in the middle of watching and had to pause and come back to later. (Not all of us are 3 with nothing better to do than watch something all the way through, lol) I hope to see this in the future updates soon!"
2019-11-13 16:57:31,Nice app with one exception,4,Krul68,False,"This is a really nice app, but needs one major improvement. Otherwise I would have given it five stars. In all other streaming services you have a “continue watching section”, and a “watch from the beginning or where you left off” option. This service has neither, at the moment. Which means you have to remember what episode you where watching when you paused the show. Not a big deal, but just a pain. Considering it was just launched yesterday, I assume they will add these features. All in all very good app."
2019-11-14 03:06:40,Love it could use something though,5,grbkcbdh,False,"I have had Disney plus since it came out and I love it. I  get to watch all my favorite shows and movies but, when I am watching and I get off because I want to watch a different show for a little bit it doesn’t save my spot. So I have to locate where it was again. Also they need to have a space to put the episodes like a “ Continue Watching” area so it is easier than going and trying to find the show again. Thank You."
2020-03-20 13:18:19,Were is Encahnted?,4,QueensMommyof4,False,"Dear Disney+

   I absolutely love Disney+. I’ve watched so many movies and shows like Snow White and the 7 dwarfs, Jessie, Finding dory and more. One day I wanted to watch the 2008 Enchanted movie. I looked it up on Disney+ and it wasn’t there. I assumed that it wasn’t a Disney movie so I checked on Google and it was a Disney movie. So can you please put that movie on Disney+ because I love it. Also it was smart of you to put newer movies like frozen 2 on Disney+  because of the coronavirus outbreak. My younger sister is OBSESSED with frozen and frozen 2. So can you fix Enchanted?

Thanks from Layla"
2019-11-13 14:59:17,New Standard in Streaming,5,dtmiller82,False,"The new Disney Plus streaming service is a game changer in the entertainment world, and puts me one step closer to “cutting the cord.”  The variety and abundance of programs are well balanced to satisfy all members of our family.  Once the licenses for a number of movies expire within other streaming services, and are added to this app, it’ll get even stronger.

The only improvement I would suggest is to create a “continue watching” category by profile, or allow viewers to resume a paused program."
2020-09-25 05:16:54,Needs better updates,3,obobly,False,"Okay so Disney plus a a good app and all. BUT I have the app in my phone and there is Times where I go to click on a show and it tells me “oh oh something went wrong with playing ( name of show or move)” and i literally would not be able to watch it for days to a week because im not able to steam anything, so I updated the app and it still is saying the same thing. I believe they need to fix this problem fast. Because I feel like it’s literally a waste of my money if I’m not able to view any of the movies days because of this problem."
2020-04-30 11:51:16,"Amazing, and magical!",5,charlie.montenegro,False,"Disney + is amazing! Me personally, I love Disney so, so, so much, and everything to do with it, the films, the shows, the Parks, they’re all so magical, and they create memories for a lifetime, and especially me, because I’m a big Disney fan. I love Disney, from infinity, and to beyond! I just want to say, Disney has really reached for the skies on this one, like always, and created something magical, again, like always. I’ll say it again. I. Love. Disney, so, so, so, so much!!! Thanks Disney, and we all hope to see you soon!"
2020-04-08 14:04:02,Only one issue,5,glitersthe name,False,"The only thing that makes me mad is that some of the movies you can’t watch till a later date like pirates of the Caribbean, maleficent, Alice in wonderland though the looking glass, solo and much more I just think we should be able to watch this too like those movies Came out a few years ago and toy story four and frozen 2 are already on there I know there both  like really popular movies but I just think we should have the other movies too"
2020-01-08 00:28:58,Amazing,4,Khtjx,False,"When I saw the trailer for this service I was amazed that there was going to be tons of shows and movies, the show I have been enjoying the most is The Simpsons. However I feel like there is a little bit room for improvement. One is that I’m not a fan on how old seasons of the Simpsons are cropped and when I try to go back while watching a movie the pause and skip 10 sec button was loading everytime and that you should make a menu that show’s upcoming titles. But overall, a very solid streaming service."
2020-02-20 23:11:34,It’s Mid-road,3,Higley,False,"I like the app, but 2 suggestions, one of which you might do. Give an option where you can see all your downloads on 1 screen (the option I expect you to do, as it’s just human decency) and the second option being release more of your marvel and Star Wars titles. Such as releasing all episodes of the animated series of both franchises on the shows you currently offer, and that’s what I know you won’t do until you finish milking those cash cows.

Thank you Disney... I think?

I’d pay a little 50% extra for these options, but you obviously know cash better than I do"
2020-01-10 19:12:48,App great but not so for support,2,JessieB20,False,"The app and content are great but I’ve been having trouble with support. I purchased a gift subscription for my in-laws on 12/24 and provided the wrong email (my fault and I def take responsibility for that). Within a few hours of realizing my error, I contacted support and provided the correct email. It’s been frustrating ever since trying to get this resolved. I’ve contacted support numerous times looking for a status update and all I get is that it’s prioritized with the higher up dept. Wondering if they just don’t have enough resources to work on issues. I think they’re trying to summon Walt Disney himself from the dead to fix my issue."
2019-12-17 21:10:54,Error 83 is such a great show I can’t even,1,Ex-Baby Yoda fan,False,"This is literally the worst streaming app I have ever seen. You think all the money Disney makes they would at least design a better system. It is not compatible with Samsung TVs that are 4-5 years old. If you use those, hate to burst your bubble, but you will get error 83 instead of baby yoda. Good luck getting help from the site too they don’t help anyone who mentions error 83. They’ll tell you to DM, but never answer you back. I have tried everything. I have tried to play it on my laptop and hdmi wire it to the tv, that worked for two days then I got error 83. I’ve been at this for hours, I have tried everything I’m angry and really wanting to punch a mouse right now."
2019-11-28 21:38:16,Nice but needs some work,4,Lynnblank,False,I like the app in general. One of the biggest downfalls I have is that auto play doesn’t work when the tablets are plugged in. I tried on both kindle and iPad. When we travel we set the kids up to watch a series and since it doesn’t auto play we the parents have to manually tell it to play since our youngest can’t reach the screen from the car seat. This doesn’t happen with Netflix. This is only an issue when plugged in. When the device is unplugged auto play works correctly.
2019-12-09 21:15:30,5 stars for content.  1 star for poor 4K and HDR implementation.,1,FireWarrior186,False,"The title says it all.  No need to discuss further regarding content, it is quite amazing to have so much at hand to watch.  However there is another matter at hand.

4K HDR.  Yes I initially streamed via Chromecast on a Samsung KS8000.  I tested using the Mandalorian.  The blacks and contrast levels were low but I figured that was part of the show’s aesthetic.  Not the case at all as I decided to watch The Winter Soldier.  The colors appeared so washed out and dark it was unbearable.  I switched to my Samsung’s native Disney+ app and while I only get 1080p SDR content, the colors and contrast levels were far more pleasing to the eye and accurate.

Please investigate and update the app accordingly.  The 4K HDR content is sadly very disappointing."
2020-09-03 19:29:37,Ok,4,kittien n cat,False,Disney+ has lots of great shows but it doesn’t always have what I’m looking for so I sometimes just get really bored and I’d say it’s not the best for road trips because it’s easy to watch all of the good movies and there’s tons of like annoying ones but there’s some good movies in there I’d say it’s OK it’s not amazing and it’s not horrible it has good movies and that at least has movies for adults there’s nothing inappropriate and there’s movies and TV shows for little kids for learning and for everything in between i’d say it’s a four star rating
2019-11-22 21:46:15,Needs work,3,Clickbait1,False,I love the content and overall Idea of it. but on there next update they should put and continue watching section or a watch again section it’s vary annoying to have to search but I have to watch every single time I get out of the app. I also wish they would do a little bit more work on the Disney+ from phone to TV connection because I have a ox cord that I use to plug in my phone to the TV so I can play movies from my phone on my TV and every single time I plug it in without a doubt it always freezes stops or has a blank screen but still plays audio.
2019-11-18 17:56:07,Love this app.,5,Sir baggy bottoms,False,"I love this app. Get to watch all my favorite Disney movies, shows, and the mandalorian. I love the fact this is cleaner then Netflix and cheaper. I found shows I watched as a kid and movies I’ve seen growing up. Plus all the marvel and Star Wars are on the app.  Recommend this app over Netflix. I feel like I have more options then Netflix. Which is wonderful. It’s family friendly which I great. Not many  things are family friendly. Plus kids friendly. I hope it stays family friendly. 😀!"
2019-11-12 07:29:22,Disney. All Your Dreams Come True,5,Tazmanian Rex,False,"What bad is there to say about this app? It has anything and everything people of all ages could want. Old programs, new programs, younger shows, older shows, all the classics and even soon to be classics. It’s hard to beat when Disney has been such a household name for us all and now we have access to continue that with the next generation. No more hunting DVDs and Blu Rays, Disney has given us all access to our childhood. Let your imagination run free and enjoy this amazing app."
2020-09-18 21:14:39,The best app!! would recommend!! Please add this one show though!,5,CandyMS712,False,"This app is truly amazing! i don’t have cable at my house so i can watch all my childhood shows whenever i want to.... one thing, there is this one show that i would love to have on here. it’s called “Backstage” i loved this show however they took it off netflix so i can’t watch it anymore but it would be great if it was on here! also thank you so much for adding “Once upon a time”! Again this app is the best!!"
2020-09-03 04:56:11,Good just one problem,4,to can play that video game,False,"So Basically it’s very good and well put in to but. Theres a problem that might affect how much people download this app and see this bug.
Idk if anybody has the same problem but when your watching a movie like I was watching I think it was Christmas Cronicle and all asudent. The screen freezes but the dialogue is still playing it go’s on like this for 30 seconds the resumes the 
Screen and replays the audio all over again. Just a suggestion to fix this bug. But overall this is a great game. :)"
2019-11-26 03:01:29,I love it but...,4,Kaiti_Rose,False,"It has a few bugs which is reasonable considering it’s still fairly new. Right now, I can’t resume a movie without it failing to connect (it’s been a consistent problem for me), so I logged out of the account to re-login only for it to say its having issues connecting to my account. I don’t think I can be the only one experiencing these issues and I want to keep using the app, so I really hope this can be fixed soon. Other than that, I love being able to have all of my childhood shows so easy to access."
2020-07-26 01:04:55,Needs a lot of work..,1,GCSchwend,False,"This app does not represent rightly Disney’s motto of perfection by any stretch, and here is why. When watching any multi episode season the app doesn’t say what episode number your on. Usually this would not be a problem but when you get to the end of an episode it does not take you automatically to the next one. On top of that there is no forward or backward buttons to jump forward or back episodes. So for example if you are in a monolithic series like clone wars you have to remember exactly which episode you are on then you have to traverse back though all the seasons and episodes wasting time just to go to the next episode. Yes the app looks nice, but what a painful experience.."
2020-05-06 23:59:03,"Good App, VERY Glitchy",5,LitTurtleMan,False,"The past couple of weeks haven’t been so great with this app. Just to point out when you go to the download section it occasionally crashes. Also crashes right when I open the a
App sometimes and have to open it repeatedly. Also what’s with delete your shows from playlists tried finding drain the oceans in the natural geographic section and it was there! Had to go all the way searching it up. Failed app, good content."
2020-03-25 06:11:30,No way to control or adjust HD,1,shadowpixy,False,"Not everyone on the planet has unlimited
Internet. Disney+ does not give the user any control of their “viewing experience,” and thereby not blowing through 600G of data in a week. How can a global company like Disney not offer the option to adjust the resolution so that families, all families, can enjoy the shows? As it is, we get to watch maybe one or two per week so we can save enough of our internet package for other things. And now the the whole planet is in lockdown and we can’t even watch movies for a distraction from what’s going on. Thanks Disney. I don’t know who is greasing you’re palm but they are clearly more important than the people who made you huge. Walt would not approve."
2020-02-21 16:06:26,"Content ok, app is pretty terrible",3,Evilonfirestorm,False,"The app itself has some issue that can get quite annoying after the first couple of days. Doesn’t remember where you were up to, doesn’t sync between web and app, the skip ahead takes your continuous pressing as a suggestion etc.
Also, there is the content quality is very bad. Guardians of the Galaxy 2 the sound volume varies from so quite you can hardly hear it with iPhone volume on high to blasting out so loud that you can hear it three rooms away.
I would wait a year before getting it for Disney to fix all the bugs!"
2020-01-05 18:20:26,Great app but DEFINITELY needs work!,3,asdgdhjs,False,"Having Disney+ is awesome and brings back so many memories, however over the past weeks there have been some issues:

1) I wont allow me to add any more shows/movies to my watchlist; I’ll add something, go to my watchlist and its not even there as if i never added it! So i have to search for it every time I'm ready to watch more.

2) “Skip Intro”could use some work, it will only skip to about less than halfway into the intro. Might as well watch the intro lol

3) Certain shows and movies that I'm resuming have not saved my progress and i either have to start the movie over and wait for it to fast forward, or spend my time trying to find the episode i was on which makes it very difficult 
 
I know i wrote a lot lol but if this helps you guys out or if anybody is having the same issues as me this will hopefully let Disney know these are problems that make it hard to fully enjoy the app with ease !"
2020-01-02 11:25:41,For nerds and fellow nostalgic 90s kids,5,lillechler,False,"This app has everything a kid at heart wants, it’s not as perfect of an app as Netflix but it’s very close and has much more movies and tv shows that us nerd enjoy. Almost everything marvel, Star Wars, Pixar! The major problem with this app is what to watch first?! There is a bit of confusion with them not having some movies until 2021* or whatever until they earn back the rights to their own movies but eventually, Disney+ will overcome any streaming service out there!"
2019-11-20 19:55:53,Enjoying... but a couple additions,4,ATLmusicguru,False,"I’m thoroughly loving this app and the platform itself, but there are a couple changes that would be huge across all platforms. 
The platform doesn’t remember which episodes I’ve already watched and where I’m picking up. A “Continue Watching” or “Recently Watching” row makes for quick and easy starts after having to leave the app. It’s a struggle trying to remember the name of the last thing I watched. 
When using the online site, the volume changes don’t maintain between episodes, so I’m adjusting the volume at the beginning of each episode. 

Overall, it’s been a beautiful experience watching so many shows and movie I’ve loved and collected over the years. My mom is a huge Disney fan, has been since a young age, so I’m looking forward to sharing this new watching opportunity with her, especially all of the Marvel films! 

Thanks Disney!"
2019-11-17 22:48:01,Coming along,4,ok this is enough,False,I love this app! As a Disney lover it is the perfect app for you! You have the ability to watch any old Disney/Disney channel and Pixar classics. Along with marvel and National Geographic of course! The only thing that I would improve is that it doesn’t keep track of what you were watching before and you have to search for the show again. The other thing is that you have to remember what episode you are on because it won’t just tell you where you are. That’s the only downside other than that it is the perfect app!
2019-11-14 15:12:31,Resuming tv shows or movie,4,cjebrhdjjd,False,I like the streaming service so far but the main thing that I don’t like about this is when you go back to the show/movie it’s starts you back at the beginning. If I’m watching the Simpson’s and I’m on season 5 episode 6 I just want to hit play and resume we’re I was at. I don’t like how I have to go into season and try to find the episode I was on. So all I ask is make it easier for us to start back at the spot we left off. I think Disney + is doing a good job so far but that’s my only problem with this service.
2019-11-17 15:24:37,Key Feature Missing,3,Nocfenix,False,"Love the content. Definitely nothing lacking there. 

However, I absolutely hate the lack of a currently watching or progress into a series indicator. It’s a pain to step away from a show and to try to come back later and have to read the information to determine which episode I was last watching so that I can pick back up where I left off. 

Yes, you only get Three Stars as a result of this. It is frustrating and inconvenient and this is the only streaming service that I’ve used that doesn’t have it. Once implemented I’ll happily change my rating."
2019-11-16 22:29:50,Where’s continue watching?,5,ztsharp,False,"I love love LOVE Disney+. It’s all I’ve been doing since it came out, but there is one major flaw, and it’s that there’s no continue watching feature. I know, when we complain about it we just sound lazy, but honestly it’s tiring to have to keep finding the show you were watching, then have to try to find the episode that you were on earlier. It’s not a dealbreaker for me, and the app is still awesome, but a continue watching feature would be nice."
2020-08-20 16:34:19,Netflix for Marvel and Disney fans,4,YJ2468,False,"You must experience it yourself to truly be amazed by its glory. It has all my favorite Disney and Marvel content, a great place for kids to experience non violent content, and allows for multiple accounts. It’s literally Netflix for fans of Marvel, Pixar, Star Wars, and more.
The only downside I would reference is the lack of being able to delete something from your watch history. For instance if a little kid watches Pooh Bear and all you can see as recommendations or titles on your account now is Pooh Bear and other Disney little kid junk."
2019-11-13 04:17:03,I have had nothing but issues,1,Porshee28,False,"I was so excited for this app. As my daughter loves Disney. When we tried to watch earlier on my phone we couldn’t access content. When that started working, I began having issues with being able to stream it on my Apple TV. I was on the phone for 3 hours with Apple support. When we made attempts to get it to stream or mirror on Apple TV the app began having problems. Apple tells me that I basically need a newer TV and or a new Apple TV to be able to stream on our television. Or we can watch on a newer phone or tablet. Basically, go spend $200 plus to be able to use this app. 
I am so disappointed and curtails my excitement for this. The time wasted in my day and so forth."
2019-11-12 17:34:42,First Day,5,Myersb819,False,"People, you do realize it literally launched hours ago? It’s going to have bugs, and it’s going to crash. So many people are trying to download and access it right now. 

It has a ton of movies, including all my childhood favorites! Disney promises more, including original content. Be patient!!! If they delayed the launch to include more, you’d be in an uproar about that. Also, give it a little time for more streaming devices to be added. Like I said, it’s only been several HOURS!"
2020-09-14 05:03:33,Deserves a 0,1,CCVFDChief,False,"Great lineup, but just like the old Disney movie app, downloading movies is a joke. I spent hours downloading movies onto an iPad for a 10 hour road trip so my 3 year old granddaughter would have something to do. After two movies, we got a message that we didn’t have a connection. Well, duh, that’s why we downloaded movies. Connected to the phone to log in on the iPad. The app then said I had no downloads. Exactly what the old Disney movie app did in the past. Why have the ability to download movies if you have to stay logged into an Internet connection to watch them? Worst programming ever. Maybe Disney can hire a High School computer class to create a better app for them. VERY disappointed."
2020-09-05 19:27:51,So many crybabies,5,matts4545,False,Mulan is a premium movie that was to be released in theaters.  Because of the pandemic it was released online for $30.  Why are you complaining about it?  How do you think movies are paid for?  The movie cost $200 million to make and they have to charge money for it.  Everyone should stop whining about it and understand that nothing in this world is free.  I know the Democrats have corrupted our society with that belief but it’s not true.  Someone always has to pay.
2020-04-07 16:47:53,Add A.N.T farm to Disney plus,4,alzina jones,False,I love Disney plus and all my childhood memories of the shows I used to watch but when ever you watch a couple episodes then switch to a different Device it gets you episodes mixed up also some of the older shows aren’t on there like I’ve been DIEEEEEEING for A.N.T farm to be on her since I started use it Disney plus a couple months ago and it seems as though you guys are only adding movies and if it’s not a new movie it’s a Disney plus original so it would be great if you guys added more Disney channel shows
2020-08-10 12:50:08,Love this app,5,onominuse3000,False,I love this app I’ve found new shows to watch old ones bad newer ones like I really like the suite life of Zack and cody and the suite life on deck and wizards of Waverly places and a really old one the adventures of spin and Marty and I have two things I want you to add the further adventures of spin and Marty and the New Adventures of Spin and Marty  I want to add those because there is probley no other way for me to see the further adventures of spin and Marty and the New Adventures of Spin and Marty so please please please add them
2020-05-23 19:51:18,The problems,1,mikal danny,False,"Dear Disney

I am writing this review to tell you that I love watching movies and tv on Disney+ but there is one serious problem and that is The episodes of some tv shows are in the wrong order. Now it’s don’t sound like a problem but let say you love Phineas and ferb and want to watch every episode from start to end, so you go in and click the episode they showed as the first episode but it’s not. Sure It’s a problem with most of the shows on here, but Phineas and ferb is one of Disney’s most popular shows of all time, and this is how you treat it. It also have effected two other well known Disney shows. The original ducktails and ducktails 2017. So Disney, could you please fix this problem"
2020-03-29 01:12:06,We want episodes to be released more frequently,4,ticftufyfyffyyfd,False,"I don’t like how new episodes come out once per week. I know many others feel this way. For example, fans of “The Clone Wars” are dying to see what happens to Ashoka and Anakin. All we ask for is to at least release new episode every other day. Example: every Sunday, Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday and new episode could be released. I know releasing episode once a week builds up suspense so we would want to watch shows more, however all we want to see our favorite characters. Please do this."
2020-01-04 23:54:41,Disney Fan,4,Love Half Priced Drinks,False,"I love what Disney did for this app! 
I’ve seen a whole bunch of movies and tv shows since the first day it came out. 
My only issue is that sometimes I’ll be watching on my phone and I get kicked out of the app and it won’t work for a few minutes. It doesn’t do that on my tv. It’s only happened once on my daughters tablet. 
I’m hoping that it’s something related to an update because I checked if it needed an update and I have the most recent one. 
Again thanks Disney and hopefully this tiny issue will get fixed."
2020-03-16 01:23:51,Updated!,5,BigbangtheoryDeprived,False,"Great app, no troubles with it at all, from a technical point of view. 

But where is the “Resume/Continue Watching” list??? And no way to know if you’ve watched something already? So odd. Annoying when you’re trying to watch a series but can’t remember which episode you stopped on so you don’t know where to resume next time. 

I love the app and I love being able to watch all my favorites, including all the movies previously in the vault. Where is “Ben and Me” by the way? Stop showing me pop ups for new episodes of shows that I haven’t even watched (wouldn’t know it though, since I can’t see what I’ve recently watched). Once these few issues are resolved, I’ll be more than happy to add that fifth star.

They fixed everything on my list! (Except adding “Ben and Me”....) so they have earned their 5th star."
2020-02-05 18:15:41,Not enough for older people,3,Alohawest,False,"After a couple of weeks, you go through everything, don’t not let us watch shows that some call racist. They were good enough for Walt(Who was friends with my Grandfather and Grandma who was from Mexico) it was how the past did movies then. It’s ok to stereotype aliens in Star Wars? Star buying more old movies of sports, TV sitcoms like Home improvement, Last man standing. Heck for the 20 to 40 year olds do A reality show like Bravo’s Below deck, but on your cruises. If I could come up with 100’s of ideas why can’t your team who is getting paid to come with just few?"
2019-12-27 00:02:30,Pause/continue watching issue,4,A.Tab,False,"I have the Disney + app on both my iPhone and iPad and experience an issue on both when I pause a movie or show for more then a few minutes (which happens after with children). If I come back to resume 5 minutes later or the next day, the title image shows that I’ve watched some of the show but when I resume it starts from the beginning every time. I’m using the most up to date app and this continues to happen. My only issue and complaint with the app"
2020-01-04 03:20:42,Loading issues,2,Zack8181,False,"I’ve been on this app two weeks now and it has been working great and everything has been going well. But recently i have been trying to watch my shows and I am receiving black screens and also the show will not load. This really make me frustrated and make me want to get my money back. I tried to Change to using my data then to trying Wi-Fi and I refuses to load.
I’m out of ideas and will fight to get my money back because this is very disappointing for me. This problem has been happening for the last two days. I even deleted the app and reloaded the whole app and the same issue occurs."
2020-01-01 13:53:02,Best movie app EVER!!!,5,Eafd003,False,Love this app I been using it since my bestie told me about it I started to hate Netflix I didn’t like the movies on it and even deleted way before Disney + came out! I use this app every day when I want to watch something I want! Next the price is cheaper then Netflix I really would pay for Disney + every day just to watch! Last I think the movies are amazing (and the new ones) on Disney + I give this all stars! If you could rate out of 10 I would! I recommend Disney + :D
2019-12-02 00:27:32,Issue with continue watching,4,eclipse31485729749282,False,"I absolutely love this app. So many great things to watch. But recently whenever I go to the continue watching section. I click whatever I was gonna continue watching and it starts all over every single time. I’ve updated the app and it happens every time. Also, it either won’t remember what I was watching or it’ll say I am still watching something I finished three weeks ago. Which now means I’ve lost what episode I’m on :/ Hope a fix comes soon or if a simple reinstall would help?"
2019-12-26 19:07:46,Great but doesn’t load.,3,needausernamealltaken,False,"I love all things Disney and go to Disney parks a lot. I was very happy when this was announced. Great shows, movies,etc. I watched as a kid. However, on mobile and console it doesn’t load a lot. On mobile it’s not so bad, but on console I tried for half an hour to pull up a Star Wars movie and nothing worked. And on mobile the avatars for your profile don’t load. Also, I downloaded 3 episode of a show it said it was all good and downloaded. I get on the flight and try to pull them up and it doesn’t load or says there is an error. Please fix these loading issues."
2019-12-13 19:30:00,Boot people off ?,5,DannyTheCosmicKid,False,"Hey so I would find it really helpful if y’all made a feature where you can kick curtain people/devices off of your Disney plus account because it has come to my attention that a fellow acquaintance  of mine has been sharing my Disney+ with a couple of his friends. If you guys could do that I’ll be very appreciative! Disney+ is honestly really great with all its shows and movies, it give me my childhood nostalgia n I love it ! And the boot feature would make it so much better"
2019-12-03 11:58:53,Bugs,3,"I'm not fat, I'm fluffy",False,"So I don’t know if I am the only one that this is happening to. But when I spend time going through everything in the app and adding things to my watch list I would expect the things I pick to be there. That being said, about 80% of what I chose is no where to be seen when I go into my watch list. There is only a handful of what I put in there. Then I have to go back through and uncheck and recheck everything. But then more stuff gets taken out of my watch list. And the things that are there, show up twice. Other then that... great app. I feel like a kid again."
2019-11-28 22:50:01,Good but needs work,4,Maraperez,False,"-So far I like the things that are offered but it’s mostly content for kids 
- add more profile pics like all the characters from Baymax, all marvel characters, Meg from Hercules, and more. (Honestly the 3D animation characters look better than the 2d characters so add more 3D characters). 
-Their should be more content like from fox since Disney owns them. So could you please Release the old X-men movies and all of fox content. Their should also be a my list option to mark up the shows/movies you want to watch for later.
-Add more content like the mandalorian.
-Their should also be a option to watch the movies released to the theaters and we could pay a little extra to watch it at home then after 6months the movie should be free. 
-Add more adult content, make a kid mode for your kids and a teens mode for teens. Then the adults will be able to watch the content they want."
2019-11-20 15:25:40,Good content but can use some updates.,4,Raj Chhatbar,False,"I am a marvel and disney classics fan. I got subscription on day one. I don’t know of they are still adding content or not but I don’t see a few movies. Nor they are mentioned. Like the incredible hulk (all hulk movies for that matter), Spiderman (homecoming and far from home). Also don’t have continue watching thing which most apps/website that have streaming services have.

Overall good content but can be made better. I am a fan and it is not going to change because of few in-app hiccups."
2019-11-24 20:33:32,I mean... it works,2,dissapointed reptile,False,"The app works fine on my phone. But on my TV... the whole service is jank to say the least. Once you select a movie or show to see the description, you are committed. There is no way to return to the home screen and select something else, once you start playing the movie or show you have to watch until the very end, and even after that you can only watch related movies and shows. The only way to go back to the home screen is to completely restart the app. It’s. So. JANKY! I have full faith that all of this will be fixed in the future, but in it’s current state the app is not compatible with a non-Apple TV..."
2019-11-23 22:26:50,I need help,5,PRStorm,False,"I created my Disney account so I can purchase one of the plans, then I go to buy the $6.99 a month plan and then it takes me to a screen where it says “please contact customer service” then it gives me two options, call customer service or dismiss, so I then call customer service and it says estimated wait time will be greater than 10 minutes and it’s been 38 minutes and I have called multiple times, is there anything else I can do?"
2019-11-23 13:43:18,Great App,5,Uni The Magical Unicorn,False,Okay so this app does have a little bugs here and there. But overall this is a great app. Sometimes the bios of episodes will switch around but to me it’s not a big deal. Being a new app I am surprised how there are not many bugs. The profile thing is great if you don’t want others with your account to watch what you are watching and get you off track. I didn’t realize how many movies would be on here. I recommend this app to anyone that is a Disney fan.
2019-11-23 02:25:02,Disney,1,Em_ea,False,"This app is horrible! You can never play anything. Every title says something is wrong and you have to chose something else to watch. If you get lucky and can watch a show, it glitches and lags! I signed up for Disney plus before it came out. I actually signed up for the year. When it went live I was unable to log onto my account. I reset my password and it still told me I had to call customer service. When I went to call, I had to wait for more than hour three days in a row! I was never able to speak to anyone. I had to create a whole new account with a different email to be able to get on. I love all the movies and shows the app has, too bad I can never watch any of it!"
2019-11-22 20:35:57,"Disney Is the Bomb, this app isn’t",2,Unrealpatch,False,"There are a number of issues with this app.
The biggest is the rewind or restart from the beginning.
I watched a movie all the way through. You would think it would start a the beginning if you pulled the movie up again, but no, you have to spend time backing it up. Like the old days when you had to rewind the VHS tapes...
Additionally, it would be nice to have a thumbnail image as you scroll forward or backward 
2) adding a profile. Let’s say we add a child, because certain content, pg 13 movies, should not be watched by underage kids.
So, you set them up with their own profile, but that doesn’t restrict them from going into their older sibling profile or the parent profile. There needs to be controls for this.
3) series information. It would be very nice to know when the next episode of a series will be released. Also, if there are future shows coming it would be nice to know their prospective release date.
I’m sure there will be improvements..."
2019-11-16 06:10:10,"Loving it so far, Device Control",4,Samisteroreo,False,"Loving the app so far, all I would say is that I would like to be able to manage the number of devices that are logged unto my device and being able to kick off if the number passes the limit. Most other steaming devices have that option where you can log into to their website manually & manage the number of devices. Also a continue watching feature would be nice as well as more personalization with profiles, possibly even locking them. Thank you!"
2019-11-19 17:53:01,EVERYTHING A FAN OF DISNEY WOULD LOVE...,5,Novelist to Expert,False,"...and SO much more.  Only wish there was a way to continue watching movies/shows without having to look for them every time I go back to them.  Also, depending on the device, the movie I’m watching either continues where I left off (Xbox One) or completely starts over (Samsung Smart TV).  Other than that, keep up the great work, Disney!❤️❤️❤️

*Side-Note:

I HATE... HATE... HATE that I have to wait two years before I can watch ‘Tomorrowland’.  A real heartbreaker.  Good thing Disney’s hat is deep."
2019-11-17 16:48:30,Navigation Issues Ruin the Experiene,1,Gss1001,False,"On the Apple TV this is really terrible to work with. 

If you try to watch a movie that is 95% complete (and in the credits) it just takes you to a suggested screen and shows you the end of the credits over and over. As others have said it needs a “recently watched” or “continue watching” option. I am actually shocked such basic and critical functionality was missed in Disney’s beta testing. It is a big enough issue that we are going to other apps/services to find items we know are still playing other places. 

This also desperately needs to ask you if you want to resume or start over. I know Apple recently switched to the automatically keep playing option for their TV App....but we don’t like it there either. 

And last, finding movies that are not in Disney’s key categories  is not as easy as it needs to be. Why do I need to go to search, and then scroll right 3 million times to see the moves from a decade?  How about letting us click a category and then see a larger list of movies."
2019-11-14 16:28:31,best thing ever!!,4,brielletaylee,False,"Disney+ is probably the best thing that has ever happened to me. Bringing my childhood back was all I ever dreamed of, now I have it. However, I do have one suggestion. I really really wish that there was a place for “continue watching” or that it kept track of that you are watching in some way. I was watching a show and the next day, went to watch it again and it started the whole series over again. It was a little bit frustrating. If this could be fixed, I would have no complaints what so ever."
2019-11-15 04:39:17,What you could think and More,5,Magonz10,False,"For the first foray into the steaming war, Disney has hit the spot. It has plenty of quality content and I can only see it getting better in time. Must have addition to the home that cost the price of a cheap lunch. The app has anything you would want in a 2019 app, besides a currently watching feature which is kind of a weird omission. Nonetheless, the layout and ease of use really make the app stand up to the quality of content it delivers."
2019-11-14 07:27:45,Great content~ One suggestion,4,lvlyviolets,False,"I am really enjoying all of the content on the app. I love all of the old movies and cartoons from my childhood. The Pixar shorts are also so cute.

 My one suggestion would be to add a Continue watching  feature so we can find the shows we were previously watching right away. I’d also request that the show start where we left off watching it.  At this time the show starts at the beginning each time. I’m sure in time this will be rectified. 

Thanks again for a wonderful app. I’m having so much fun with it."
2020-06-22 19:41:09,Updated: fewer bugs but still annoyances,4,Fat Freddy's Cat,False,"Still a number of bugs in the app; frequently won’t remember where a video was paused, trying to fast forward or rewind fails and may crash out of the video, won’t show the “resume” until you play a movie completely until the end, etc. Needs a lot more work.

Update: more stable, but it still won’t show allow me to watch a movie or episode again if there is any time, even a few second, it considers “unwatched”. Quite annoying."
2019-11-14 06:42:08,Could be better,3,Darbear1120,False,"I love that all the old shows are there however if I back out of a show or movie I’m watching it makes me start all over from the beginning. I’m halfway through a season of Hannah Montana and whenever I go to play it, it starts from the very first episode so I have to go look for the episode and fast forward to where I was. Same goes with movies if I pause it and back out to go do something else it starts the whole movie over. I’m a Big disney fan so the fact that it makes you start all over is quite annoying. Netflix doesn’t do that neither should Disney+"
2019-11-12 17:00:46,"Beyond my Expectations, Thank you Disney",5,TonyPossible,False,"I had no idea what to really expect when this came out; I suppose in a way I didn’t fully grasp what it meant to really open up “the vault”. My focus was really only on the Princesses, Star Wars, Avengers, the more recent stuff. But to open the app today and see essentially EVERYTHING from Steamboat Willie forward, it’s absolutely incredible. I’m overwhelmed with such wonderful memories from my childhood, I couldn’t be happier. Thank you Disney for making this service possible."
2019-11-12 15:07:21,The whole family is FREAKING OUT!,5,PsychoSarahh,False,"I was up at 4 am this morning looking through everything and making my profiles. My 4 year old was just as excited as me and I’m 26. Not only does it have every show imaginable that my daughter watches and every movie, but it has all of my old throw backs as a kid too and I am so excited to binge watch some of this stuff (HANNAH MONTANA!). This is incredible. Thank you Disney for bringing something so wonderful into our homes! So many choices the possibilities on what to watch are endless! Yay yay yay yay yay yay yay!!!!!"
2020-08-06 19:11:47,I love Disney+,5,adorree cancled,False,"Although you have to pay to access Disney+ tv shows or movies, in my opinion it is better to get Disney+ then getting Nickelodeon. Yes I know I’m shading them or whatever it’s called. But let’s be honest here. A lot of people most likely hate/don’t like the app💔 Nickelodeon as before when they had better reviews and shows. Now back to Disney+. I just love that Disney+ has all the shows that I and others have grew up with. It brings back memories of happier times. ❤️"
2020-07-28 00:21:15,Bug issues?,3,Sailor R.,False,"I like Disney+ itself, but there are some technical issues. If I cast to my tv and hit resume episode/movie it always restarts it. I don’t have this issue when watching on my computer. Also the close-captioning needs fixing as well, but I think that is an overall site/app issue, not just the app. Sometimes it just straight up stops working, or only works every other sentence, for someone who is a bit hard of hearing this is extremely frustrating, especially when I am watching something new and don’t already know the story."
2020-07-01 08:37:26,Like a bad Netflix knockoff,1,Newsgirl6,False,"So if you go on vacation, or move to a different country, instead of just displaying what Disney+ offers in that country-using your same app and your same account(like Netflix)-you not only need to make a new account in country B, but you have to make a whole new Apple ID for that country, download the same app but from that countries App Store, and then sign in with the new Disney+ account you’ve created, for another monthly fee. 
Disney might have a great catalog, but they have a terrible user interface, and don’t seem to have a real care for customer experience. Has more the feeling of someone dropping a bunch of DVD‘s on the floor, for you to figure out what to do with."
2020-04-27 16:05:42,It’s a good app,4,av.ala,False,It’s a favorite streaming app but there’s one thing I would like to see in it. Ever since all the Older Disney shows been on Disney channel I been wanting to watch them again and this is the best chance. But I want to see an option where we can put different shows in a list have have a auto play where it chooses different episodes from show randomly because sometimes it gets tiring watching the same show over and over. Thank you for reading and hopefully this is a good idea
2020-02-19 22:40:56,"It’s good, but needs improvement",4,AnimalLover1225,False,"Overall, I love that I get to watch all my favorite movies, but I really don’t like that it shows a movie, then I click on it thinking I can watch it, but then I can’t until like 2 or 3 years pass! I think that you guys should step up your game a bit, and add more shows and movies, and I’m really excited for the new Marvel shows that are coming out! But it a super long wait, hopefully you guys could release them a bit earlier, but please take as long as you need to make the best. Thanks!"
2020-04-21 03:19:44,Great app with a few flaws,5,MooMilk88888🐮,False,"I absolutely love being able to watch shows that I used to watch a long time ago on Netflix, like Jessie, Lab Rats, Best Friends Whenever, etc. The classic movies are also all great. I just wished that before they added some stuff that not that many people watched they would add stuff that I feel more people would watch for the nostalgia like the most populars, A.N.T Farm, and Mighty Med. Anyways, it’s still a great app that I recommend getting a subscription on."
2020-03-22 04:23:17,WAIT. VERY Limited Content. Lots of issues.,2,TryThisNicknameOnForSizeThisTime,False,"I’ll keep this one short. 

There is very little top rated content. 

Most material is old Disney channel or broadcast TV from 10-20 years ago. There are also missing episodes for some reason. Likely something not considered acceptable for whatever reasons and Disney self censored. Like many missing movies like Song Of The South which will likely never be seen ever again, sadly. 

Likewise very little original content or recent movies. 

Unless you own no Disney movies on video, don’t see them in theaters, and largely want to watch old Disney movies you’re likely better off holding off. 

I preordered and prepaid for three years in advance at nearly half price. Even though the family has annual Disney park passes and loves Disney and their movies it still turns out to not be worth even half price to us. 

There are also numerous issues with accessing and filtering content. Product feels very rushed to market with lots of bugs and limited quality material."
2020-02-06 23:25:32,2 way login,4,lewensky-minaj,False,"I would wish for a password when entering the app.
Like me having to enter a password than another password that I can get by text if you know what I mean??? 
I would love for Disney + to do this for secure reasons and for me to have more control over my account and who I have on my account.
I would love to see the history of who’s watching and I guess kick profiles out of my account if I don’t want them on my account no more.
Either than that i absolutely love Disney +, it’s literally the future of watching a channels"
2020-01-15 03:05:26,Slow load speed,4,Caleb_d92,False,This app is great and I’m loving almost all of it. The only problem I have is it can be pretty slow sometimes and whatever show or movie is playing will pause for no reason and the loading circle will pop up for minutes at a time. This can be triggered by random occurrences or fast forwarding or rewinding. I understand that fast forwarding and rewinding will be slow but I feel that for a multi billion dollar company they could make it faster like Netflix. Other then that this app is great!
2020-01-18 20:35:42,Not happy,1,Skyburger exbert,False,"Very disappointed with Disney+. I loved the idea of it. So I purchased the annual subscription after my week trial. When the trial ended my account was suspended because I was a minor (which is understandable). Three days later it charged me $70 for the annual subscription. I called Disney+ customer service, waited an hour to talk to someone and he said they would put in a request for a refund, and it would take around 10 business days to get a refund. That was November 23rd of 2019! I have yet to receive a refund, i’ve called the customer service number more then enough times.  If it was only $7 for the month subscription it would not be such a big deal to me, but this is $70 we’re talking about."
2019-12-28 03:57:50,Love the app,4,LeCo1986,False,"I absolutely love Disney + but I do have one suggestion. Please allow different users under the same account to have separate profiles, otherwise if we are watching the same show it becomes difficult if we are on different episodes. Also, the movies that aren’t available yet should be under a “coming soon” area. I’ve gone to watch some movies only to be disappointed because they are not yet available to watch.  Other than that, the app is great and I haven’t had any issues."
2019-12-25 15:32:58,It’s great but.,4,PZ Hacker,False,Ok first of all it’s an great app. But there are a few glitches that I really want fixed. The most annoying one is if that it’s buffering and it goes the app will get glitched and the video will play but there are TWO AUDIO TAPES GOING AND I CANT STOP IT the only way is if I delete the app and sign back in. And two why aren’t there all the movies that were made I get that Disney wants us to spend our money and watch the movies in the theater but the ones that came out already like The Incredible Hulk or Home Alone 4 why aren’t they on there?
2019-12-02 15:12:45,"Great and all, but still very buggy",4,mscag21,False,"I love that I can watch all of my favorite shows using Disney+, but it still has several flaws. It constantly crashes for me and will randomly pause for no apparent reason. I also downloaded several hours of content to watch for later, but it appears to have disappeared even though it’s still taking up space on my iPad. I have no way to access it or delete it, which means I have several gigabytes of storage going seemingly nowhere. Please fix these issues."
2019-12-17 08:51:39,App is great content is great but.....,3,qbarnold,False,"Not being allowed to use a VPN to stream is a total crock Disney, so you want me to leave my phone vulnerable to get hacked to use WiFi or use all my data to stream anything. If you find somewhere that has free WiFi and you turn on your VPN, then it won’t let you watch anything..... totally stupid! Fix that issue please! Also not allowed to use an adapter from your phone to HDMI to a TV if you are away from home on Vacation is pretty crappy too! Those are the only two issues I’ve had... but they are pretty big ones to me! Otherwise would be 5 stars"
2019-12-15 17:55:13,Good but not great,2,skinet_07,False,"Disney plus has a lot of great content but they have not figured out all the nicks and kinks. Doesn’t always work well on my Xbox 1. Every so often it will kick me out of the show I’m watching. The bundle package isn’t worth it. You CANNOT watch ufc fights live! Also they have no customer service. I’ve called three times with questions regarding my account and have yet to speak with a representative. All three times I was told my wait time was 10 minutes and waited longer than 20 minutes all three times and didn’t get to speak with anyone. Disappointed with a company such as Disney that cant produce adequate customer 
service."
2019-11-23 19:57:49,It’s Disney!!!,4,Lil Wooze,False,"I’m loving watching all my favorite childhood tv shows and movies, my kids enjoying there favorites at their finger tips also. I must say it money worth spending even though it use a hell of a lot of data. So if you don’t have WiFi or unlimited high speed internet you need to get ready to run out of data fast. I will say to it would be nice if I had like a currently watching list, would be nice, I don’t like to go search for the same show or movie over every time I come back to the app, other than that 👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾"
2019-11-29 04:49:15,Missing episodes :(,3,Reviewing to Unlock,False,"I love having access to all of my favorite Disney content, but was very sadden to see that of my favorite shows were missing many of their episodes. It's hard to binge watch a series without every episode. In fact, binge watching in general seems to be made harder on Disney+ also through their original content, which is updated weekly by episode instead of a season all at once. That I can deal with though because I know the episodes will be there eventually-- it’s the missing episodes from established series that I'm more worried about."
2019-11-20 13:55:52,Great so far but missing functions,4,XoundStudio,False,"Easy to use. Some bugs and missing functions like “Play from the beginning”, “Watch again”. I really need “Play from the beginning”

Tapping ‘+’ button to add the movie/TV series to my watch list seems it works but there is a bug. ‘+’ button turns to ‘v’ checkmark, but when I get back from other section, it rolled back to ‘+’. The movies and TV series I tapped are added into the watch list but the + button in the each content page stays the same and it makes me confused.

Great so far."
2019-11-21 18:19:48,Continue watching section,5,Imliztho,False,I love the content on the app! I’d love to have a “continue watching” section or a way to know what I’ve already watched. Also maybe switching up the movies/shows that show up when you open the app. I’d like to have more options to watch without having to search for them.  I was born in 94 so keep that in mind when you’re making the selection for the home page.  Haha 😃 I added this app specifically for the throwback movies. 😄
2019-11-19 09:38:44,Enjoying but there’s a big part missing,4,PrincessKatieGrace0916,False,So I am loving Disney+ it’s honestly a gift from the heavens above but with that being said I was that there was a continue watching. I feel like that is a necessity because I’ve been binge watching Hannah Montana and some times I fall asleep and for get where I am at in the season. Other than that everything else is great. Oh one other thing I was a little disappointed that The Proud Family series wasn’t on there but I got all the Disney classics so I’m not going to complain. Loving it really happy with the results!!
2019-11-19 02:07:49,Just a couple fixes,4,Jadyn Ribeiro,False,"So far, I love Disney+. I have watched multiple movies and started several shows. My biggest problem is that there is no “currently watching” section. If it were just a service for movies, I would understand it more, or even if the progress were saved if I searched whatever I was watching, but right now, as I have a horrible memory, I can’t watch more than the first couple episodes of a show as I can’t remember exactly where I was. Otherwise, I’m finding Disney+ to be an amazing platform."
2019-11-18 02:03:54,Great Content! Missing “recently/currently watch lost”,4,Jeremy Z,False,"This seems like a no-brainer, but for some reason this app appears to be missing a feature common to every other streaming app in existence. There’s no “recently played” or “in progress” section in the main area or side menu, meaning one has to search for the title again if coming back to the app to finish a show. 

Further, perhaps due to a bug, playback has occasionally started over at the beginning of a show instead of resuming my previous position."
2019-11-17 07:43:48,No Continue Watching?,4,Geriannaa,False,"This app is great and I really love it. It has all the throwback shows and movies that we love except the proud family tv show which disappoints me. Now, this review would have gotten the full 5 stars if they had a continue watching section. It’s very inconvenient when you have to go back into the app and try to remember the exact episode that you were on. Please fix it in the next update Disney. I know y’all got the money for it. Make it happen. And please consider putting the proud family tv show on there."
2019-11-17 05:03:07,Where’s my continue watching section??,3,Mar :)),False,"Overall, browsing for titles is comparable to Netflix and other streaming services. The major mistake of the app is that there is no section for your movies and shows you have paused. There needs to be a continue watching section. I have also noticed that if I start a show under my profile on my Roku and then try to finish it on my iPhone, there’s not a way to pick up where I left off. It’s a good app, just needs lots of improvement. Would also like to be able to rate titles so it can give us more personalized recommendations."
2019-11-16 13:58:15,Magical App,4,Brinicus Maximus,False,"This app is wonderful, you get all the Disney, Marvel, Pixar, and Star Wars movies you could ever dream of. It includes National Geopraphic which is absolutely amazing!! The reason I gave 4 stars is because they have no skipping back or forward buttons and the series don’t automatically play the next episode, nor do they show how far you’ve progressed or pick up where you left off when you go back to them. If it weren’t for those tiny things I would give this app 5 stars and then some! 👏🏼 Disney always know a what they’re doing."
2019-11-16 12:51:40,Great but needs some fixes,4,henjeff_yt,False,"Don’t get me wrong I love Disney plus! But the main reason why I didn’t rate it five stars is because of some of its glitches. Now don’t get me wrong, it did just come out the other day so you are going to have some glitches but the main one that I’m having trouble with is buffering when a movie/show starts and I have to skip parts of the movie so it doesn’t buffer and it sometimes happens in key moments of the show/movie. Overall Disney plus is a great streaming device. Keep up the great work Disney!"
2019-11-15 03:03:26,Disney Plus. 4 stars.,4,LyRose (Lyla),False,"I am giving this 4 stars because I think it is a great app but it could use some changes. For instance, it doesn’t have some of the new Disney movies such as the live-action Aladdin. It is also missing some of my favorite movies like The Emperors New Groove and others. I do think it could be improved by adding a Currently watching page or something to that point. Disney plus also takes a while to load on my TV, it might just be my TV though. So to conclude Disney Plus is a great app but it could use some work."
2019-11-14 14:34:09,Continue Watching Tab,4,Brittany87Nichole,False,I love this app.. I waited an extra day to get it since the surge would be high. I haven’t had any glitching or problems. I love the layout and the selection is amazing!! I would really like a Continue Watching section. I tend to watch multiple shows at a time and I have to try to keep track of where I left off. I have to search the show and then go through each episode where I think I left off. If we could add that feature this would be the absolute best thing to happen to 80s and 90s babies lol
2019-11-14 14:58:03,Needs work,1,AppleBuddy22,False,"The service and set up is great but there are some glitches. It won’t load things, takes forever to load, won’t let me add things, won’t let me edit profile pictures, etc. but I was thinking it would be great to have a master password, cause streaming services like this requires multiple people to be logged into one account but I don’t want EVERYONE to have access to my credit card info, email, change certain subscription things, go into people profiles and change the restriction etc. there should be a master password just to change billing, and technical things,  etc.

Also, is there a “currently watching” section? Cause I can’t seem to find it.

 thanks!!"
2019-11-14 05:39:40,"Great content, and works overall, but...",4,robdunn220,False,"I know it just launched, so I’m giving more of feedback for developers rather than criticism. 

Chrome cast seems to sometimes have a connection problem just with the in-app controls. 

Navigation via selecting a title, for example the suggested titles, feels odd. It feels like you are just adding layers on top of the previous page, with a weird X to close it, rather than having a more fluid, browser like experience.

Need a continue watching function, and a next episode arrow while watching a series. Also, when leaving the app and coming back to resume a series, it doesn’t always know where I last left off. Multiple times, it resumed at a point I had paused it hours ago, and far from my most recent playback. So obviously a bug with that feature.

But it’s Disney, so I’m optimistic you guys will optimize the app over time."
2020-08-13 04:26:39,Hamilton!!!,4,Peanut42069,False,"Not going to lie, i didnt use the app as much as i do now that they added Hamilton! And i started watching almost everything musical related on disney plus. But i do wish you would put stuff such as parker plays or player select on there. Disney plus is a really good app with a lot of good shows. My favorite is ""Encore!"" I hope theres more episodes to be made for it!!! It would also be really cool if your could make profile pictures with the cast of Hamilton. Thank you for reading my review! Have a good day/night!"
2019-11-13 04:39:53,Need Currently Watching on home screen,5,kaylu,False,"My family and I are in awe with Disney+. We will subscribe for years to come I imagine. One thing I would like to see is a “Currently Watching” slot on the home screen. We had to pause a movie to run an errand today and when we went to play it again, we had to search for it. It also didn’t show how much of it had elapsed when we went to play it. There should be a “Resume” button and a “Play from beginning”."
2020-06-13 03:07:02,I would give it five stars if.....,4,Starlyna24,False,Because every year you have to pay 70$ and I payed because I got money for Christmas anyway no adds and you don’t have to pay for no adds so I recommend you guys get this I know it is a lot of money but it is worth it and you can watch any shows Disney Netflix fancy nacelle my personal fav movie on there you can only watch the movie on Disney+ if you get Disney + then you watch all three movies of high school musical and sharpays fabulous adventure this is amazing app you don’t pay for adds
2020-07-14 15:30:33,Decent but needs some improvement,3,Ky ky pey pey,False,"I love Disney plus! Some updates I would add are adding older shows like Liv and Maddie, bunk’d. (I love those!)😊 I am wondering why sometimes the original Sandlot shows up but Not all the time? Why is there the sequel but not the original? I like that movie and would like to watch it. Also I think that some of the shows need to be updated more so you can watch newer episodes. (I’m pretty sure there are new Big City Greens and Sydney to the Max)I also think you should add a new episode page so you can stay caught up!
Just wanted to share my opinion! :)"
2019-11-24 03:47:01,Love the selection available,4,Ajacev,False,"Disney+ has been long awaited for in my household. However, it is my hope that some basic functions will be available on this streaming service. Playing a program from where I left off seems to be available on all other platforms and should be found on this one as well!  Please fix this ASAP as it frustrates young and old alike to not be able to pick up where I last left off.  Hopefully this will be updated prior to the travel holiday of Thanksgiving!  🙏🏼"
2020-04-19 21:06:56,Fix the search Functionality,1,Eduardo Hates you,False,"You would think that one of the richest corporations in the world would have a great app, but that’s not the case in this situation, for instance if you are watching a series you can’t simply click on it and it will continue where you left of, nope, it will open the series and you have to manually find the episode you left on on, RIDICULOUS!! Ohh and the search functionality it’s the WORST! Even though the movie or show it’s available you can’t just search for it because “cannot be found”, if your goal is to surpass Netflix you have a LONG WAY to go it’s a mediocre app and you would think you would’ve had top notch developers doing this for you."
2020-03-22 05:03:45,Problem,3,DarkWinterYt,False,I’ve been a paid user since they have allowed ppl to get Disney plus and for some reason when I’m watching a show and it’s over I have to keep quiting out of the app and restarting it then I can watch the next episode and for movies I can not rewind it or forward it without it crashing and making me restart my Xbox I watch it on my tv and that’s when it does it but for my phone it seems to work fine you need to figure out why it’s doing this and fix it cuz it’s very annoying and for $60 a year there should be no problems with this app
2020-01-25 06:01:51,Renewal of Downloaded Contents Issue and Pause Button Issue,5,It's Me Jason,False,"I renewed Disney+ after a week of unsubscription due to a travel to a foreign country. After I came back I renewed my subscription, but I can’t renew my downloaded contents. A popup message keeps saying “Connect to the internet to automatically renew downloaded content.” But its not working.
Also I can’t pause after playing several seconds due to a rotating icon in the center of the screen.
Please fix this issues."
2019-12-17 18:33:48,Worst app I’ve ever tried.,1,Love walker,False,"I watch Disney plus at home and have had no issues, but have had multiple issues with the app. I recently downloaded the app on my phone to watch from anywhere. I’ve tried to watch a movie and it will freeze a few minutes in or the volume will cut out completely but the video is still playing. The only way to get the volume back is to exit and close out the app completely, then reopen it. Since a movie was having issues I tried to watch a 30 minute show. I tried three different shows and each one would have an Error playing and would close. 

I have the iPhone XR and AT&T. I am sadly disappointed this app didn’t work."
2019-12-13 23:41:19,Good App on Apple IPhone/IPad. Bad for Samsung Tab,2,Dankonia201220122012,False,"The app loads quickly and can stream videos quickly on the IPhone & IPad.  However, it’s completely frustrating on the Samsung Tablet. It keeps loading, the circle of death, freezing, crashing, pressing on the movie/show you want see doesn’t work, etc... I tried shutting off the tablet and restarting it; deleting the app and adding it again, checking on the memory of the tab (which has plenty of space).. None seem to make it work.. So if you’re a Apple user for Disney+ it’s a solid app with no slow, lagging, or crashing issues.. Can’t say the same for the app used on a Samsung Tablet."
2019-12-01 13:22:57,The app is great but the tv version......,5,gugskjjgc,False,Ok I didn’t know how to contact you about this so I just came here. If you have it on your tv it works there is just one problem. If you click on something that you might want to watch and find out u don’t want to watch it this is no back button.  Can you please add one because I have been having to get all the way out then opening it up again. I hope this made some sense and you can fix it fast.
2019-11-15 22:10:50,Great App! Just needs work...,4,ayeee_kk,False,"I got the Disney+ app today, and was using it all throughout the day. Then all of a sudden it will not let me log in. I’ve always enjoyed everything Disney, and when I heard about this app I was so excited. But there are some changes that could help the app be more successful. Like first fixing the log in. Next I would probably put in a Currently watching or Recently watched list which would help tremendously! Overall from the time I actually got to use the app I loved it! Just need to work out the kinks."
2019-11-14 20:43:34,Needs an update,4,Mjb1313,False,"The content is great, but the app is missing somethings. There’s no continue watching list, so If you stop watching a tv episode, you have to search for it and remember the season and episode that you were watching to continue watching. Also there should be an easier way to find “my list”. 

Also, every time I start a new episode or start a movie, closed captioning is defaulted on. Its not that big of a deal, but it gets annoying. I can’t figure out how to change the default play settings."
2019-11-15 08:25:36,Pretty good but needs a basic feature,3,Cephalo-ipod,False,"So far so good with this app. Haven’t run into major problems with it yet.

However, it is missing a pretty basic feature that is essential. That is something that displays your history and progress. If you are watching a series, especially multiple series, knowing where you left off is a good thing to be able to easily see. So a listing of what you watched and an indicator of partially watched episodes (and the ability to resume) would be great!

A wishlist item would be commentary tracks as a language choice for movies."
2020-08-14 17:58:48,Buffers,2,Hotwheelsg67,False,"I hate when it occasionally buffers none of my other apps do this on my iPad you have to stop it and start it up again and then it goes to your commercials and then starts the program, afraid to pay for premium service because of this issue, I went away for a while thinking they would fix it, and they haven’t but they keep coming out with new content, so I thought I’d check it out again and it’s still not fixed what’s the problem who wants to pay for something if you can’t even fix it, sorry I won’t pay for something if you can’t fix the buffering problem when it goes to commercials and doesn’t  want to come back, without restarting it myself it doesn’t happen constantly but when it does it’s frustrating, quit adding new content and get people excited for something you can’t take care of or maintain good service, hope you have people look into this, I should have wrote a review right from the get go however I’m assuming I’m not the only one with problems I see a lot of low stars"
2020-08-17 14:55:29,Constant changes in quality and content,3,8432789,False,"I am a day 1 user, waited months for this app at first never had any issues in my Apple TV or iPhone but now it’s constant errors. Most recent is just solid black screen with an outline of the channel schedule instead of puss in boots error screen occasionally. They also took away the office channel quietly a couple of days ago. Changed the reality tv “in it to win it” channel (that had huge variety in programming) into deal or no deal for over a week non stop 24/7. Just rename the channel already after nearly 250 episodes straight it’s officially the deal or no deal channel! I assumed okay maybe after they play each episode in the series I will get to see something new, sadly they just stared over from episode 1 again. Same episodes of kitchen nightmares (season 1) have been playing non stop for 5 days when it’s KN evening time block and the profit season 1. This didn’t used to be the case! There would be a mix of several seasons. I was thinking about subscribing but these are pretty major and sudden changes that make no sense. They were also what I used the app for 99% of the time. Went from being my #1 app to deleting and resubscribing to CBS all access who instead of taking away content added over 200 season of different shows last week."
2020-09-26 00:47:21,"Decent streaming service, TERRIBLE app",1,kevintstephens,False,"The streaming service itself is decent, but this review is for the app specifically (both iPad and Apple TV). For some annoying reason, the app uses its own player rather than the iOS one, which means you can’t use any of the iOS features such as Picture in Picture or AirPlay. When I have a keyboard connected, I can’t use the space bar to play or pause like I can in pretty much every other streaming app. If I pause the video and use another app and then come back, it can often take up to 15 seconds for the video to load again before I can play.

My biggest complaint with the app/service is when auto playing the next episode, about 70% of the time the next episode will start somewhere in the middle and I have to manually rewind it back to the beginning. It’s a good thing I’m only re-watching a show I’ve already seen multiple times before so nothing gets spoiled for me, but if I were watching a new show and had something spoiled because of this bug, I would be very upset.

All things considered, once I finish watching the show I’m currently watching, I’ll be canceling my Peacock subscription. The content available to stream does not outweigh the numerous annoyances and complaints I have with the apps."
2020-09-30 02:24:30,Streaming is decent,1,jbram63,False,"The streaming is okay. Haven’t had issues. I have issues with them imposing the app on us in order to watch the Premier League. How is it that so far we’ve HAD to stream to watch the champions of England play 2 of the top teams? The biggest games should be available on TV where the majority of people already pay to watch the EPL. Putting them on the Peacock app is pretty upsetting and likely an attempt to boost their subscriptions to justify putting more big games on the app after NBCSB Gold failed. 

Additionally, I can’t even use air play because it’s restricted and there’s no app for my 2019 samsung tv. Having a toddler and crawler, we keep wires hidden and out of reach. So, airplay alike is a must. But if I want to watch this on the tv, I have to bring wires out and end up spending half the time keeping the kids from grabbing the wires or pushing buttons on the laptop. 

Pretty big waste of money if you ask me. They pay insane amounts to win contracts to get the rights to the games but then want us to pay additional for the big matches in addition to the main channel that’s supposed to show the best games. ....It’s like if I pay for HBO but then forced to pay extra for Game of Thrones...oh, and I wouldn’t easily be able to watch it on my tv."
2020-09-04 15:21:20,Worst streaming app,1,Spiritbob67,False,"Ok so is 2020 and you create a streaming app that cannot be casted to a smart tv.  Is it me or is that not just dumb. I might have expected this 10 or maybe 5 years ago but in 2020 if you are making a streaming app you better make sure it can cast to a tv. My tv does not get the peacock app so it would have been nice to just air play it.  It’s not preferable but it works. But you crated a streaming app that cannot do this. What kind of stupid are your programmers that thought “hey let’s create a streaming app that cannot be casted. There’s a brilliant idea”.  

Also the app navigation is kinda clunky. I do like one of the original shows but I hate watching it on my phone.  For the first few episode I kinda was able to make it cast but when I tried last night i could only connect the sound. One again. What a dumb move at not adding the ability to cast to smart TVs. Why is this not a thing. Hell even the dumbest cable app have figured out the value of allowing there content to be casted. But the big nbc universal company cannot get this one small thing right.  You are loosing the streaming war my friends and all because you where to dumb yo not add one feature that allows people to watch your shows on there big TVs."
2020-08-03 02:49:43,"What is this, the year 2000?",1,Awfulllllll!!!!!!!!,False,"This app is the absolute WORST app I have dealt with in 20 years. Whoever the hell designed this app needs to be fired and seriously consider a career change.
Unless you have a very specific device to stream this service on, GOOD LUCK. First, getting it to play on our tv was like attempting brain surgery as a GED drop-out. Second, the content struggles to play worse than a no-armed wrestler. Third, if the app fails to load after commercials it just reverts back to the previous stopping point. This happened 3 straight times before we just gave up. That’s when I started searching for and easily finding reviews saying the exact same things over and over and over. A show that should have taken an hour to watch took over an hour and 45 min to finish. I’d rather buy every single show and movie on this app (from another service) rather than attempt to watch them on Peacock FOR FREE. Anyone considering Peacock, RUN AWAY AS FAST AS YOU CAN. If somehow this review makes it to anybody in the tv/movie industry, pull your content from this app before people start turning their crosshairs on you! 
Take this thing out back and put a bullet in it, put us ALL out of our misery. HORRIBLE!!!!"
2020-09-18 05:09:14,Trashy Cash Grab,1,c.ekis,False,"At least when some big corporations take full advantage of a fanbase they give a reasonable product, with a good interface, and enjoyable content. In the case of Peacock TV, they have taken our built up love of a product that they have spent time promoting, with hosts and talent that we now care about, and bastardized it to the last degree. This app is horrendous, nearly impossible to navigate or to play on your TV. What once was abundant free access to channels, shows and games, has now moved all behind multiple levels of a pay-wall. But wait, here’s the kicker, it’s not available on nearly HALF of all streaming content providers such as Roku, Amazon’s Fire Stick, Samsung’s Smart TV, LG’s Smart TV, and others. Spare me with the “You can just watch it on your phone” or “Watch it in your browser”. These products were previously free or abundant to watch on many NBCUniversal channels, and instead you must pay to watch them on this garbage can of an app, in the sake of competition which will clearly fail this corporation and their product. Don’t download, don’t pay for this service. Find a stream of the EPL games online, save your cash. They certainly don’t deserve it."
2020-09-14 01:59:31,"LOVE the content, but problems with playback",4,RoMoBenCeasDee,False,"Go team 🌈Peacock 🦚 for providing AWESOME content — all my favorite Bravo shows, every season, even every season of Bethany’s spin offs! 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
I also love the variety of Indie movies with great celebs and directors! 🥳🥳🥳

Now — the problem with playback. When I watch Peacock on my TV through my Xfinity connected set top/DVR cable box, everything works fine. No problems with the time tracking, (ie if you are 30 mins into watching the program, it accurately displays the progress). 

BUT — while watching the same show or movie on my iPad or iPhone (not necessarily picking up where I left off on one device and watching it on another — that works great and is an awesome feature!), I can be 30 mins into a show, yet the progress bar is stuck on the time from the last commercial break. Then if I try to rewind, it makes me watch the entire commercial break AGAIN. 

It has happened where I wind up being forced to watch more commercial time than actual content time in one 30 minute show!!

Also, sometimes I will get all the way to the end of a program, and it won’t auto start the next episode. Any progression feature (rewind, FF, etc) tapped will trigger ANOTHER commercial break!! 

Lastly, can’t you remove commercials altogether for premium subscribers?

Hopefully this progression issue gets fixed QUICKLY 🙏🏼🙏🏼! It’s REALLY ANNOYING to have to sit through so many commercials every time you rewind!!"
2020-09-30 19:32:34,"Decent service, real poor app quality",3,Hän C.,False,"First off, I do love the peacock service - I appreciate the shows available and as I pay for the full subscription I’ve been enjoying the content without ads. The streaming quality has been good for me. 

I do agree with another reviewer that the reload time is obnoxious, if I pause the video and come back to it. Pausing and returning usually takes the video back 15 seconds which is very frustrating. 

Also, I’m frustrated that I can’t have the app running in the background while doing something else on my phone. Netflix lets me turn my phone off and just plays the show as audio, which allows me to listen to the show without draining my battery. This seems like a very basic user functionality that all apps should have these days, but I understand that if the app was maybe rushed to production that it’s not there yet. I would appreciate this being fixed for an update. 

I also wish the app had a homepage where I could save shows for later. It’s frustrating having to remember what I was interested in or having to use the search bar every single time I want to find a show. 

I also would like an option to hide the main page, which currently shows news and stuff like that. It should be a customizable front page or I should be able to hide the news/sports so that they’re not what I see when I first open the app. 

I will keep paying for this for a few months in the hopes that the app will get better."
2020-09-14 19:42:25,Insulting to customers,1,jsjsjshshdjfjdjsufndj,False,"I got this app because NBC Sports elects to split up Premier League coverage between the channel and the app so that you have to subscribe to two different services to follow one team. Additionally I had to get it on my iOS device because despite moving half a season to the app they haven't made a freak to make it available for Roku (t most popular streaming device). All of this suggests to me that NBC does not care about it's customers. They're using their exclusive EPL deal in a way that ultimately decreases the popularity of the league in order to milk a little more money out of the most loyal fans and force people onto their dumb platform.

On top of that, the iOS version is garbage. I'm watching a terrible stream on my office computer because I literally couldn't make the stream work at all on my iPad. By the way the Peacock stream is several seconds behind so if you're on social media or have push notifications on then every big moment in the game is going to be spoiled right before you see it. It's really dreadful.

Crossing my fingers that a different network wins EPL rights soon. I hope Peacock is a huge failure."
2020-10-19 06:13:31,It’s ok,2,zats2005,False,"I got this app to watch Rich Eisen. His show is live, but I am not available to watch until about 1/2 way through.  I prefer to watch beginning to end. The live broadcast ends at 1pm, but it is not made available to replay until late evening or in some cases the next day. When I 1st began using the app I had frustrations a plenty and hoped the bugs would get worked out before The 
Rich Eisen Show stopped broadcasting on TV. I don’t see that anything has improved from when I 1st began using the app until now.
This app seems to have a wonderful catalog of movies, sports, old tv shows and The problem is, you get about 7-10 minutes in and the buffering begins. I am then informed that I am not connected to the internet. This is while I see all WiFi bars light up. I am then informed I should try a premium membership. Each time I open the app I see so many programs to watch, but it ends in heartbreak. This streaming service looks great,  but it doesn’t work. And don’t tell me it’s free and the suggest I purchase premium version."
2020-09-20 17:47:29,Not Ready for Prime Time (but we are forced to use it),2,jrscassady,True,"I have been using the app on my iPad and Apple TV since it was released. The app freezes regularly - some of which require navigating away from the stream and back in order to rectify, others which self-correct. This is especially frustrating when watching live sports (I subscribed to Peacock Premium to have access to English Premier League streams). EDIT 9/20: I had no problems 9/19 and 9/20. I would increase to 3 stars except I saw too many people on Twitter and Discord with the same problems I had in the past - including the significant delay which Peacock emailed me was a technical issue limited to 9/14.

The app excludes NBC Sports despite NBC Sports Gold being replaced by Peacock - leaving sports fans with having to check multiple locations for content. NBC should migrate all NBC Sports app contents to Peacock and allow users to log into their cable subscription in Peacock to unlock access to that content. A single NBC content app would make for a better user experience."
2020-10-04 12:07:56,Lacking compared to all other streaming services,2,fcftuvbu,False,"I’ve never written an app review before but NBC is forcing us to watch Premier League this way so hopefully they can improve the streaming options to match other live streaming services.  The live stream has been ok but they need to add the ability to pause/rewind/FF like most live streaming services offer.  Also having the ability to join an already started event live or have the option to start at beginning would be a big improvement and again this is the standard in today’s streaming services.  The only other issues i have is the speed  of searches can be very slow and when you browse for Premier League replays and select one you don’t get the button to play.  I’ve found that you have to perform a search to find the replay you want and select it that way to see the button.  Both the browse and search seem to go to the same screen but only through search do you actually see the button to play it.

2020-10-04 20:54:17,"Bad UI, slow, sound loss",2,wh156,False,"Want to watch your favorite show?  I hope you’ve got plenty of time. Even though I watched six episodes this morning, I have to search for the show as if I had never watched it before. Once it opens (minimum 1 minute to find it) I lose the last 7 seconds of each segment because the sound goes on mute, then I have to watch a commercial. Even if the commercial was interesting, I then lose sound for the last 7 seconds of each commercial.  At the end of each episode, you need to go through the menus to find the next one (no auto play functionality.)  I got an alert of my iPad today to watch SNL.  I click it and it’s nowhere to be found on, only a short “preview” with no link to the full episode. I went to the search, typed in SNL, waited 45 seconds watching a spinning wheel and then gave up. As soon as my free trial is over, I will be deleting. The only reason I’ve kept this app is because I got it for free.  Also, no Samsung TV app support! :("
2020-09-20 16:50:17,Disappointing,1,mfndoc,False,"NBC has moved the viewing of the majority of Premier League games to the Peacock service. Unfortunately, we are no longer able to view many of the games on the nbcsport channel, and have to subscribe (i.e. pay) in order to view the games. Peacock is not intuitive. Cannot add the premier league, or specific teams, to a watch list. Navigating previously aired games is difficult. When a game is live, there is no option to begin watching from the beginning. We are forced to watch from where the broadcast currently is. This app is extremely frustrating, poorly designed, and ridiculous that I have to now pay at least another $4.99/month to watch a sport that was already included with most cable/internet subscription services. This app is def not anywhere close to as refined as many others. Hopefully this will improve since I am now forced to use it to watch the Premier League.

ADDENDUM:
Live game paused, walk away for 5 mins, press play and game starts live and unable to simply resume from where I paused. Missed two goals. Terrible....."
2020-09-13 18:07:46,Broken promises for EPL games,2,StuckInProgrammers,False,"For years I have had Gold to watch English Premier League soccer, & I was always very happy with it. I would tell people it was a steal for 50-60 bucks a year, with all the stuff you got. It was easy to use, all in one place, & every game was available with ample supplementary material. We were told Peacock Premium would be just the same when EPL coverage switched over to it this summer. What a horrible joke!! The content is not easy to find and maneuver through. All the games are NOT included, only 175 games out of 380?!! I have to go over to NBC Sports or regular tv to watch many games. Why can’t this be all in one place? The supplementary material is hard to find- no clear lists of upcoming shows/coverage. I can’t even figure out how to pause during live play, which you could do on Gold. And if you go to the “Premier League channel” on the main page for “24 hour” programming- most of the time it’s a blank screen telling you to go to NBCSN. What happened?!"
2020-10-05 14:44:56,No Feedback offered,3,SuziRox,False,"No customer service or contact for feedback ... but has no issue taking my money! 
I’m writing re: my Roku Insignia TV
1. I can’t tell what program I have selected - I know it’s a soft white cloudy hue around the box with the program title listed - - but it’s still really tough to see and my mom can’t see it at all so she just presses ok and the wrong show starts. 
2.How do you get to episodes of a show without streaming the show first? I just want to open it and see the episodes. So instead I go to my watchlist and open the show from there ...
3. My watchlist is missing more than 1/2 the shows I added. Last night I fell asleep watching law and order - so I just wanted to open the episodes to see where I am (see point #2). Law and order used to be in my watchlist and now it’s gone ....a bunch of shows are gone. 
4. In the HISTORY of NBC I guess there has only been 45 comedies (15 rows of 3) Why oh why is Roseanne listed on the front page of “Just For Laughs” I hated that show and still do. Is there a way to “Thumbs Down” or “stop showing me this crap show” - you make me seriously wander about the amount of content you have
5. Can I go to TV shows and click Genre? Instead of finding your cheeky name for a genre? Same with movies. Do you not offer this because the amount of content is so low?
6. Seriously - how much content do you actually have?"
2020-08-19 02:12:47,"App Works Good on iPhone, Not So Good Elsewhere",3,Long John 1964,False,"I enjoy the shows I can watch on my iPhone.  Great selection, and plays back anything without a hitch.  However ...

... I also like to play videos on my much larger TV.  Now we have a problem.  My iPhone 11 Pro Max running the latest version of iOS refuses to play any videos from this app on any TV.  It will still play on my iPhone, while the TV shows a freeze frame of where I started the video.  The audio comes from the TV as it should, though. When I try to play a video on my TV from an older device, it doesn’t play on either screen, though I can still hear audio from the TV.  It still plays on my device properly while not plugged into a TV.

I have several other streaming video apps, and all work the way they’re supposed to.  Peacock is the only one that doesn't.  I was hoping the latest update would fix this problem.  It didn’t."
2020-08-25 19:39:54,Few shows and No Support,1,Pops1951,False,"I tried Peacock Premium for a couple of days and it was nothing but problems and commercials. I started watching season one episode one of Capture. About halfway through I had to leave the TV for a few minutes. When I came back, the episode would not resume. I may repeated attempts but it just simply would not allow me to restart the episode. So, in desperation, I went into the episodes section of Capture and episode one had disappeared. In other words, once you start an episode of one of the shows, you have to finish that episode and you can’t watch it again later.  That is stupid! Also, I tried watching some of the old comedies like 3rd rock from the sun.  It seem like every couple of minutes they were commercials ranging from 30 seconds to 2 minutes that I couldn’t fast forward through so I had to watch them. This is so annoying and I simply decided it was better to not have peacock at all. Don’t waste your time or money on this streaming service."
2020-08-14 01:41:11,So. Many. Bugs. (And not a great layout or features).,1,GraceGravs12,False,"All these updates, and the bugs are still there. No change to crappy functionality either. Example: on iPad, if you click more episodes, you can’t search by season. So if there’s 18 seasons of a show and you’re in the middle of season 10, and click “more episodes,” it takes you to season one episode one and then you’ll have to manually scroll to find the episode or season you were just on. 
The search feature is not intuitive and takes forever. It would also be great if there was an option for “play next episode,” so again, the scrolling issue could be avoided.
 Also, the fast forward and rewind 10 seconds function on the Apple TV remote does not work. 

Peacock has A LOT of work to do. After this month is up, I’m deleting and maybe I’ll come back in a few months to see if anything has improved, content included (not every episode of Hells Kitchen or SNL is even on the app. Super disappointed in that alone)."
2020-09-11 06:44:04,So sad To bad,2,BluLocked,False,"It really is too bad NBC... I was super excited to return to the stations of my childhood. I grew up here with NBC and was ready to return to the good stuff. Content listings are great. So much cool stuff I wanna watch.
 I, like many others only stream my tv content these days. And on a budget, I use my iPad and an HDMI cord to watch on my full screen tv. 
BUT.... sadly Peacock doesn’t think I should be able to do that. It literally has HDMI streaming blocked. Oh glory, it will play the ads and promos, but as soon as you go to real programming... nada, black screen with sound only.
I did watch the documentary The Sit-In, the main reason I got the app on my tablet. And I had gone through and picked a bunch of other stuff I would have liked to watch. 
But I think this is the end until NBC gets it together and offers up an HDMI option for us “basic” people out here."
2020-09-20 14:32:22,Nigh unusable - and a real scam,1,thefunnyboy,False,"Obviously I’m not happy that NBC has decided to put premier league football on here instead of tv, and I deeply resent having to pay 5 bucks a month for something I already pay for a tv package for, and for a service that seems to offer nothing else worth watching. (And for the record, after the free trial, I won’t.)

But even without all of that, the fact remains the app is barely usable. Turning it on and trying to search for what you want will yield loading times that are so abysmally long it will make you want to throw your device through the wall. And when streaming live sports, the streams are notoriously unreliable and well behind the actual run of play. The fact that this is still the case months after its rollout is astounding and says it all about the contempt NBC has for its viewers.

This attempt to ape Netflix isn’t working. Stay well away from it - and if you’re a footy fan, tell NBC to put the games back on tv where they belong."
2020-08-31 12:58:25,False Advertising,1,USA Reader MD,False,From the minute we heard about this channel coming out I was excited being a huge fan of SNL and growing up on the classic episodes. They originally advertised EVERY season of SNL would be available to stream so I could not wait for the launch. Unfortunately after constant conversations with customer support assuring me all seasons would eventually be launched as you can see they are only interested in the current completely unfunny episodes and have since removed even the classic first 5 seasons. Lies lies lies from day one saying that all seasons would be available. They claim you can see “clips” from old seasons on a loop channel that randomly runs skits from the show of course with more emphasis on the current seasons. If you are a fan of classic SNL you will be disappointed. I just wish people would be honest in their advertising and promises for programming. Not really the content otherwise I was hoping such as more actual classic NBC shows.
2020-09-12 16:38:39,Cant wait until next season...,1,RealFootball81,False,"When nbc does not have the contract for the tv rights to the premier league, and hopefully is not allowed to re negotiate because i thought last season was bad with nbc gold which was a greedy exploitative way to hold the games hostage , and had no idea they could actually make the coverage worse! I thought nbc gold was as low as it got , but nope , welcome to “peacock” so it is very clear to see that nbc realizes no one wants cable or live tv service and has tried to jump into the streaming game but wants to also force you to pay for cable as well based on how they split the season between streaming and live tv, so you want me to pay for cable and a premium rate for your crap service? Which by the way is always plagued with bugs. Companies like NBC are the reason people dont watch tv or want to pay for it anymore. Oh and ps, tubi is a free streaming service and has fewer commercials than this , nbc, all about the money all the time , f nbc."
2020-10-03 04:41:37,Give us ALL the episodes for goodness sake...,1,alwayssunny38,False,"I signed up for yearly premium subscription (no ads) way before it launched coz I read that there will be full seasons and episodes of the series Snapped and Dateline NBC and several other true crime series and was extremely disappointed n angry that that wasn’t the case. I don’t even understand why Dateline which is owned by themselves not being able to access the full content.
And got excited today when I found Cold Case Files series n was again beyond disappointed n angry to find that Peacock have decided to only give us very limited amount of episodes for every season......what the heck?
Why don’t we give you an amount of money that we see fit since we’re not actually enjoying full seasons n episodes and only partially for every series.....we should also be able to give you partial subscription fee right? It’s only fair.
So, for goodness sake give us the full seasons with full episodes please....."
2020-09-26 13:08:26,Frustrating Experience,1,BobthePM,False,"Utilizing the Peacock app is a supremely frustrating experience that feels like a step back. 

I primarily utilize Peacock to watch English Premier league and it’s experience is in every way inferior to the already existing NBC Sports Gold app. 

For one, navigation on the app is painful. It is hard to find the game that I am looking for. The browse function kind of works, but the search function might as well not exist. Finding replays of games seems all but impossible. For example, I wanted to find the first week game between Tottenham and Everton. Searching for both teams yielded no results. Searching for Premier league was also fruitless. In the replays section of browse, I could see some games listed but not the one that I wanted. Maybe week 1 games aren’t available?  There is no explanation to why. 

Also, the video player lacks functionality that existing NBC apps have such as pause and rewind. 

From the soccer universe perspective I now have to use 2 different apps to watch soccer; the NBC sports app exists for matches on TV, and Peacock exists for the other matches. The pervious NBC Sports app integrates both of these. 

This is a painful painful experience and that is objectively worse in almost every way to existing NBC products. I don’t mind paying for content, but it is hard not to feel like NBC is going out of their way to hurt the customer."
2020-07-22 16:48:25,Work in Progress,4,Ang57mac,False,"After watching a complete movie a clip from another movie began to play in the background and would not stop. I could not not play another video until I signed out of the app, deleted it and then reinstalled it. All this on the only device I could stream to my TV on: Apple TV 4K. There is not enough content not found on other services to endure this for. I will cancel after 7 day free trail.

I want to amend my previous review. A few bugs still remain, but most have cleared up. Full screen for newer movies and shows on Apple TV 4K.  Auto play. Occasional loading issues but backing out and going back in works fine. Customer support answers emails very quickly. Very few commercials (less than 1 minute at beginning). I will probably be a regular streamer."
2020-09-19 13:40:21,Pay wall of quality problems,3,N-Sullivan,False,I get that they want to make more money so they are locking EPL behind a pay wall. As a consumer it’s frustrating but I am willing to pay for the content even though it is wildly anti consumer. What I can’t stand is that the streaming quality on my phone and home console that I use to stream to my TV is awful the picture breaks up “smears” once or twice every five minutes. This morning I couldn’t get the app to load on my phone OR console so I had to exit and relaunch multiple times. Once I finally got it up on my console I selected match week 2 for EPL and it would load in without yet another exit and relaunch. I have zero issues with loading and streaming youtubeTV or Sunday ticket or ESPN so NBC....I’d you make the people pay then make it something worth paying extra for please
2020-07-15 19:32:38,"Excellent Content, Easy to Use",4,vdrake1457383,False,"Peacock has a lot of great features and excellent content. Any cord cutter will find value in this app, and loading it into your Apple TV. The channel line up feature is a great way to watch the news or your favorites when you don’t know what to actually play on demand. 

Other users have pointed out the poor layout of the app, and I do agree that is the improvement point required for a four star review. The endless scroll of the listed channels is brutal. The notation of the feather for premium content is a good way to show users what other great is available without shoving it down their throats or tricking them. 

Streaming platforms are tough and I thought Peacock would not have a successful launch. Looking forward to other reviews. I’m a fan."
2020-07-16 00:16:52,Needs work,4,jjsledge,False,"Biggest issue I have is that your watchlist is a part of the browse tab. It’s nearly impossible to find. The watchlist should have its own tab. It needs to be quickly accessible instead of having to dig through other content. 

Other big issue is the paywall. For $4.99, you unlock nearly everything but have to deal with commercials. For $9.99, you get some extras but there are still commercials on some things (which they claim are required). Kinda dumb. But there is a 1 week trial for free. 

Other than that, it’s ok. You get 1 free episode of their original content (rest are behind the paywall). Feel like they should do 2-3 free to make people more interested in potentially subscribing.  Showtime content is also behind the paywall."
2020-08-23 14:11:56,Poorly developed,2,Bummer12345,False,"I would think, with a big NBC budget, that they would get this right.  App is spotty on Apple TV... I can get over that... it’s crappy that it doesn’t work on older Apple TV’s.  Poor taste but I can get over that.  The thing that has me totally frustrated is that I’m trying to watch on my iPad but it won’t let me unless I have a premium plan (which I do)... when I go to click on the plan to subscribe again it tells me that I’m already subscribed.  Cool.  So I go back to the show and it says “you need to subscribe to premium”.. cool.  So I try to subscribe and it says.... you guessed it.... that i already have a subscription.

Funny how an eCommerce retailer can get tv video streaming just fine... but an actual  “tv company” failed.  

I’m sure you can fix it NBC but... wow.  You could hire some developers from Quibi- I hear they’re looking for work."
2020-08-27 11:34:54,A train wreck. You do NOT get what you pay for.,1,RJLanning,False,"I paid for the Premium upgrade so I could watch their Original Content. The shows themselves are excellent, however, Peacock inserts ads in the middle of scenes, rather than placing them at designated ad breaks. It’s annoying to have a commercial interrupt a character in mid-sentence. So... I paid extra for the Premium Plus to get rid of the ads altogether. This worked great for about 3 hours. Then Peacock suddenly decided to switch me back to the Free account which doesn’t give me access to any of the original content and they tell me I’m going to have to upgrade (again) to continue watching. I LITERALLY just gave you money 3 hours ago and you’re trying to charge me again?  I was reluctant but ultimately willing to overlook the fact that I couldn’t watch this on Roku. But there is no way I’m paying $10 a month for content that I’m not allowed to watch."
2020-07-18 14:41:10,Service needs work,1,€¥•£>|,False,"Downloaded Peacock and was excited to have new content to watch. I don’t watch on my small phone screen (2x5 screen or 60” screen... hmmmm), I have my TV set up to mirror my phone through an HDMI cord (just easier in my situation). So I’m ready to watch, plug in my phone and it asks if want to watch through Apple TV. I don’t have or want to subscribe to Apple TV so I said no. I then get a quick message informing me that it won’t now play through my TV and that apparently was that. The ad played on my TV,  but not the show. Online help is a joke; I couldn’t get back to anywhere I could say “fine, I’ll finally submit and go through Apple TV” and in retrospect I’m glad I didn’t since it looks I still wouldn’t have been able to mirror. But even so, why should I subscribe to another service to watch a service? 

Hey Peacock- Netflix and Prime let you mirror. Looks like I’ll just stick with them."
2020-08-03 03:04:34,Great App and lots of Content,5,rick6886,False,"I live in Alaska and have had no issues with the app. I run it through my Apple TV box and there have been zero glitches.

I pay the $9.99/month which isn’t a big deal, most people spend more than that in 2 days getting Starbucks every morning. The $9.99 is worth it to unlock everything, the only ads I have seen are 15 second promos before a show or program begins. I have watched multiple shows and programs and there have been no ads once the show starts.

They have the complete catalogue of many shows, I love Law and Order, every episode of SVU and Criminal Intent is on there, the last 8 seasons of the original Law and Order is on there as well.

In terms of original content “The Capture” is must see TV, one of the most original shows out there. There are several other original content shows as well that I well check out.

My minor complaint is that it is a bit user unfriendly to navigate at times. But they can clean that up. 

This is well worth the $9.99/month, my number one streaming app right now."
2020-10-04 15:22:02,Unstable,2,GoogleTool,False,"This app (for Apple TV) is the only way I can access many of the Premier League football matches now that NBC has pulled broadcast of top matches off MSNBC, making them available only through Peacock. However, in my two week’s experience with the app, I repeatedly run into problems. Sometimes a replay will start with no sound, and I have to close the app and reopen it to recover sound. More frustrating are the times a replay runs with sound but no video. In this case, reopening the app usually has no effect. I have to reboot my Apple TV in order to recover the video stream. And even then this ‘solution’ doesn’t always work. Since I experience no such difficulties with any other Apple TV apps, I can only attribute the problems to Peacock itself. It’s time NBC paid attention - since I’m certainly paying them."
2020-08-13 21:27:53,Major UI design defects !,1,AnjanT,False,"There are major design defects in the user interface. 
Selecting the “channel” mode (tv guide) immediately starts playing a previously selected channel - there is no way to “pause” play or “mute” sound. While I am trying to decide which channel I want to watch some rubbish is playing - no way to stop it. This is ridiculous. Not acceptable. 
Selecting the “trending” mode lists some featured topics such as “Headline news” shows a news “item”. Selecting the news item plays the “item”, and when finished playing the “item” the next news “item” is displayed, but there is no way to re-play an item or skip to the next item. Similarly in case of a tv “episode"" there is no way to replay the episode or skip to the next “episode”. I have to finish viewing the current episode before I am able to view the next episode. This is ridiculous. Not acceptable !"
2020-10-11 16:34:37,Overall App is awful.,1,JimmyJoe77772,False,"I think the way the App is set up is terrible. I mainly got the subscription to watch the EPL. Yet I have to swap back and forth between apps to be able to watch different games. When I had gold, all the games were at least within the same app. Also I think there needs to be a feature within the app to Favorite certain channels and shows so you don’t have to scroll and find the channel you wanted. Likewise be able to favorite a certain sport so it’s on the top of the page. I think along those same lines if you could customize the order of the tabs at the top that would be more user friendly and people could prioritize what “topic” is most important to them. I’m not a fan of the app at all. Sadly I paid for the whole year up front. Unless it gets some updates and changes I won’t be resubscribing next year."
2020-09-26 22:47:13,"Good, quality experience on iPhone",4,zumo21,False,"I enjoy the content I get to watch for free, but mostly for this review I’ve found this app to be consistently reliable. A couple of changes I’d prefer to see: it has some scrolling quirks and often I end up starting videos I didn’t intend to watch. They should use whatever Apple’s UI guidelines are for scrolling. Also, if I leave the app in the middle of a video and go back to it, it takes several seconds to reload the video from the server, instead of just continuing immediately like other streaming apps do. On that note, it would also be great if the developers can have the app work with iOS 14’s picture-in-picture feature."
2020-09-22 09:29:47,Peacock is alright.,4,NoCanSurf,False,"Downloaded the app just to watch Premiere League football (soccer). 

I’m pretty happy.

The image quality is great. The speed at which matches are uploaded is ok. The added content, “Men in Blazers”, “The Two Robbies” and the “Lowe Down” are all solid and insightful. 

Why only four stars? The quick rewind/fast forward 15 seconds is lacking. Sometimes I just want to rewatch some small moments in a match the app doesn’t make this easy as it should be. 

Thoughts on the  other shows and content on peacock. 
Kids: My daughter (age 10) is disappointed with the offering. It’s all stuff for younger kids or in her words “dumb”. 

Movies: ok, there are some worth while classics. Thumbs up from me. 

TV Shows: some of the originals look promising. I’ve not engaged with so far (time constraints). 

News and the rest: I’ve not watched but it’s there. 

I watch on an iPhone 8+, iPad Pro and AppleTV 4K. I have had ZERO troubles. 

I am paying the full price ($10/mo) until the end of the Premier League season at which time I’ll drop down to the free.  The app is solid. The content I want (PL) is there. 

It’s good."
2020-09-21 19:32:54,ROKU FINALLY AVAILABLE BUT YOU CAN STREAM FROM COMPUTER TO TV VIA HDMI USING MICROSOFT EDGE BROWSER,5,JoyWLHM,False,"Streams great on iPhone, iPad and laptop, had absolutely no streaming problems, but not optimal choices for viewing. UPDATE: USE THE MICROSOFT EDGE BROWSER TO STREAM VIA LAPTOP TO TV VIA HDMI!! Just waiting for Apple to release their new TV device and will switch to Apple TV from Roku, as Roku no longer seems to be a viable option, as Roku doesn’t support HBO MAX. Peacock has an excellent lineup on the premium tier, and the interface is excellent. Finally on Roku. Subscribed to premium tier today. Will still be switching to Apple TV device when they release their new one, as I don’t appreciate how Roku has treated us over these new product releases."
2020-10-04 16:07:06,Too many apps for premium league,2,vintg1973,False,"I got this app (and service) solely for the premier league. However, because some games are here and some on the nbc sports app, I have to go searching across apps just to watch something I’m paying for. Either allow peacock subscribers to access all the games in the nbc sports app (like you did with the gold subscription) or stream all the games on the peacock app (or both). 

Also peacock app pauses and stalls in live games , particularly bad on Apple TV. I’m paying for a service that seems not to deliver on the basics that I’m paying for. I like the quality of your coverage and commentary, but paying customers shouldn’t need to go app hunting to find the game they want, nor switch apps simply to continue watching post game coverage or continue into the next game."
2020-09-13 17:51:51,Clunky interface,1,Crono Mk I,False,"Update: We’re over a month in and still no improvement. There are at this point more 1-star reviews of this garbage app than 5-star, so this is clearly not just the opinion of a few perfectionists expecting too much. This is not a reflection of the content; as far as I can tell, this is solely a reflection of the technical aspect. Please fix!

This is the first app I’ve used on tvOS that does NOT use the native interface, making it nearly impossible to skip ahead or backwards in small increments (10 seconds is the normal skip amount). Instead I’m forced to drag the incredibly sensitive slider (with no preview thumbnail, by the way) and hope it lands where I want it to.

I imagine this non-native interface is also the reason why the subtitles have not been placed at the bottom of the screen always. Instead, they are up 3/4 of the screen half the time, where they are guaranteed to block the face of any actor standing on their mark.

Also it’s very hard to browse for a show unless you know exactly what you’re looking for, and in that case the search bar is the way to go. Peacock TV does not have so many shows and movies that they can’t offer the option to list the content alphabetically on a tab."
2020-10-19 18:46:52,Poorly executed,2,ZKitty06,False,"I downloaded to watch older episodes of some shows but it took about a minute to wish I hadn’t bothered with this app just yet. I do see the potential in this app but it needs a lot more work especially with new operating systems being released it should be compatible at least with other devices for sharing. I do feel that the idea is great, free unless you want a few extra perks which we could all use and I think would actually be great if some others did something similar, but at the very least there should be options when playing something to cast the program to your Apple TV, Firetv, or chrome cast being that the app isn’t available on every device. I can say that alone would have gotten this app a much better rating."
2020-07-19 19:34:27,"I like the content , but the steaming is not good.",2,Bluegrass bandita,False,"My streaming has been pretty terrible with this app for a couple of different reasons at different times. Things will start good, I’m able to cast,  the show or movie starts playing, but within about 10 minutes or so, the sound and the subtitles are out of sync with what’s going on. It’s truly annoying because I have hearing issues anyway and I sometimes try to read lips and I rely on things syncing up.
   The second issue is that some programs just will not cast with  my Chromecast device. It say that it’s casting, but then reverts to my I-phone or I-pad. 
   I really like the large variety of programs and channels that you offer. I truly hope that you are able to get these glitches worked out in the very near future."
2020-08-28 20:29:35,Free APP???,3,my daughters mams,False,"So I subscribed because they have shows that I cannot watch on other apps.  I signed up for free because they advertise for free.  Then I got charged $4.99 for a premium subscription.  Hello???  Why do you advertise free when it isn’t.  I do not remember signing up for premium, and even though it is only $5, I am trying to justify that for the few shows I want to see.  Not fair to advertise free if it isn’t.  Other than that I have really enjoyed the app, with one exception.  I cannot add it to my ROKU list of channels. 😏 It is very frustrating,  I often times have my TV on while doing other things on my iPad. So when I want to watch on Peacock, I have to view it on my iPad instead of on the TV, not a huge deal but a little inconvenient."
2020-08-22 02:53:09,"Low level extortion, not even trying to hide it",1,Matty_Wampus,False,"Got this app as NBC is slowly removing some of our  favorite shows from decent streaming platforms. Two initial loading screens lead into...having to rewind to the beginning of any episode of any show as the first 30 seconds are generally skipped by the app on any platform. Once we reach the beginning, the episode will stall and find the need to load again. The tv version of the App often finds itself out of
Synch, requiring an app or cable box restart. If the public at large is going to be forced to pay for additional streaming services in addition to the cable and Internet we already pay for to access those additional streaming services, said services should at least have the decency to provide a functioning user experience. Maybe even an enjoyable one..."
2020-09-21 16:11:02,Much Worse than Last Year for EPL Fans,2,cb70119,False,"Content wise, I’m never going to watch anything on this app except for soccer matches so it’s annoying to have to wade through (and pay for) junk content to reach the sports section. Would be nice if we had an option to open the app and only show sports. (Would be even better if it worked like Disney’s apps where I only have to pay for the ESPN one and I get a better app experience focused on what I actually watch.)

From a technical standpoint, it’s still not seamless on live events. I had two crashes on Apple TV, which I only had to use because there’s no Roku app. Hopefully, all that gets ironed out but it’s currently a worse experience for sports fans compared to past offerings and also competitors current offerings."
2020-07-25 21:27:43,Needs work,2,Filmks,False,"When on Chromecast the lag time between video and audio makes anything hard to watch. Have to pause and rewind to try to get the dialogue to synch up with the actors lips. And even then, it doesn’t last long and it gets out of synch again. 
The app is not intuitively designed. Doesn’t automatically play next episode when on Chromecast. 
“Continue watching” doesn’t allow you to open the series page so you have to scroll down to find it in whatever category they’ve put it in. When you start the app, it  opens to a screen I don’t care about. Doesn’t have capability to create multiple profiles. 
They need to do whatever they need to to get it on the Firestick. Otherwise it will remain a 2nd tier. streaming service."
2020-09-04 06:23:15,Premium what?,1,bcsanto,False,"I got Peacock premium for one reason. To watch Yellowstone on Paramount channel. Although I have the channel in my cable line up, Xfinity does not partner with them so I can’t use my tv provider to login to the Paramount app. This, Peacock is the answer saying all season, all shows everything Peacock has to offer. Well, I was allowed to watch S3E1 and then it directed me to either pay $2.99 to watch episode 2 or login to the Paramount app with my tv provider which is what I can’t do. So episodes 2-10 for season 3 are locked and I can’t watch them even though I have the Paramount channel I pay for in my cable line up and I also pay for Peacock Premium which says I can also watch it but yet neither app will let me do so. Very frustrating. Get organized people. I’m paying twice for something I’m not allowed to watch."
2020-09-24 22:03:54,Despicable corporate greed and idiotic product management,1,neurotrash,False,"I had to get Peacock so I could continue watching Premier League games, which I was perfectly happy to get through cable before. But now they’ve put so many of the games on this service you really can’t do without it and of course now you have to pay an additional $5/mo on top of your cable subscription. What’s really irritating is that I’m now paying more for a worse overall user experience. The app is not very good from a technical perspective, you cannot pause or navigate during live streams, you cannot follow specific teams, and it’s just really annoying to have to use this app. I won’t be forgetting this ridiculous move anytime soon — I’ve gone from someone with a positive opinion of NBC to someone with an intensely negative one. Well done!"
2020-10-02 15:28:50,Interface bad!,2,weatherapprefugee,False,"The app is working fine for me. I, however, purchased the version with no ads. And I purchased it only for the purpose of watching English Premier league soccer. However, the user interface is severely lacking. There is no organization of the games or schedule, both past and present. Good luck finding the game played last week that you want to watch today on replay! You won’t find it, not easily anyway. And there doesn’t seem to be a schedule that you can access readily, to look at the games that will be playing in the days to come. All you would have to do is borrow the format used by NBC sports app. It’s not like you’d have to do a lot of work to fix this problem!"
2020-08-04 22:37:32,The next BIG streaming giant 👏🏾,4,Jamaal Rainey,False,I use the free option and I love the selection of shows and films they have. They have a few shows I’ve wanted to binge that I couldn’t find anywhere else. The only problem I’ve had is that some time the show doesn’t pick up after a commercial. I would have to go out and start the episode again. The app also has trouble loading on my AppleTV. Those are minor problems I know they can fix since the app is so new. The commercials would usually bother me but they aren’t excessive and they mix it up like real tv. I’m a satisfied user. If they can fix those minor things it’d be perfect.
2020-09-12 14:40:36,"Horrible execution, misleading promises",1,cjhermanns,False,"I was a regular user of the NBC Sorts app and a subscriber to the Premier League package. The switch to Peacock has been a huge step backward. First, the navigation is horrible. The app seems to want to force you to look through all the things you could watch, instead of making it easy to find the ONE THING you absolutely know you want to watch. I continue to struggle finding what I want. Second, I loaded up the app to watch this mornings Premier League matches (I paid for the premium package) and found that the morning matches were not available on the app. I want to cut the cord with FiOS, and not I find that, after paying for a subscription, I can’t watch live games? Seriously? Exactly what us the selling point here? Why did they shove this terrible terrible app down our throats?"
2020-09-27 16:37:59,Pretty disappointing,1,too bad so sad 3001,False,"I paid extra money for the premium service now that Peacock has Premier League games.  First off, you can’t appear to stream the video to a device like Apple TV, or at least not easily since I haven’t been able to do it.  Second, there is no way to fast forward the video when I watch a reply which stinks.  Thirdly, there are a lot of ads you have to sit through even though I paid money.  They might be Peacock ads, but they are ads nonetheless.  Overall, coming from what I would assume is a big company with plenty of resources, this app is far from user friendly and forces me to conclude that the viewers are being taken for granted.  To that extent I can, I will be looking for any opportunity to watch sports, or anything, on another platform.  So buyer beware."
2020-09-25 14:44:24,"It works, however.",2,Lizzy potter,False,"It works, however you can’t call your app Peacock TV if you can’t play it on TV. It doesn’t support screen mirroring, which is fine, there’s no app on my TV, which is disappointing, and I can’t even open it in the browser of my TV because it doesn’t support the device. If you expect people to be at home watching movies on their phones instead of on their TV then you’d be wrong. Because personally I’d rather watch something on my TV, bigger screen, if I’m cooking I don’t have to pause the movie to look at the recipe, and everyone else in my household can watch it with me. If you had made it to support screen mirroring at least that would be a big improvement."
2020-09-20 12:42:29,Meh. Promising but falls short,3,Entelech3,False,"I bought this purely for the Premier League, and it’s not horrible, but a bit disappointing. There’s no real organization to it, I can’t simply see which games are on at a glance. The app is a bit too trendy and clean: I’d like a grid or a list somewhere, please. I don’t want to just scroll through a bunch of other random sporting crap until I find the games I want to watch.

On top of that, their refusal to put their content on Roku means I can’t watch it on all my screens. 

This isn’t the worst thing in the world, the app works as it was designed and the video quality is excellent in my experience. But for what I want out of it, it falls short."
2020-09-23 00:26:50,"Bad initial experience, good after that",4,Wilcoghost,True,"My original review was fired off in a fit of justifiable energy, as my first attempt to launch the app was met with a message telling me I was not connected to the internet. That was clearly not true.  The issue rectified itself after a couple of hours. And to the developers credit, they reached out to me - a few days later, but still. They did reach out. After the initial frustration, I have had no issues with the app. Business practices are a separate consideration. The app has been streaming Premiere League just great, and that’s all it needs to do."
2020-09-19 13:23:00,Awful Just Awful,1,80_Rocket,False,"Signed up for Peacock to watch EPL. Content is difficult to navigate and access. Everton v West Brom match should be streaming. Difficult to find. Found the match by clicking on Leeds v Fulham and was able to watch less than 5 minutes before screen went blank and then posted “Coverage Will Being Shortly”. 
Click on the Premier League channel and you are told to go look in a different tab on a different page of the app. A streaming app that cannot be cast to a smart TV is not worth the subscription fee. 
The person or persons that designed this app should make a different career choice. 
NBC EPL coverage is the best in any sport. Moving the coverage to Peacock is an insult to Premiere League Live and the fans. 
An attempt by NBC to monetize their exclusive EPL coverage that is embarrassingly awful."
2020-09-28 19:35:41,"Streams good, support bad",2,Arsh18,False,"I only have this app because NBC is making people purchase the subscription for it to watch all live premier league soccer games. They layout is very poor and hard to navigate, and the lack of settings is a huge downside. The streams have been good quality for me so far without issues, but they don’t offer Picture in Picture for ios14 which is very disappointing, nor do they offer an option for chromecasting or playing on Apple tv. They make an app for smart TVs but you would think if we have to pay for the service they could at least build an app that has some of the same capabilities that the nbc sports app has, regardless of how well it works."
2020-09-22 14:48:14,So not worth it!,1,Staylor1012,False,"If you expect to get unlimited access to shows and episodes by paying a premium, then you won’t find it here.  Yes, ad-free worked well (about the only positive I can say). However, you have a limited time to watch episodes of the current season.  When the new season starts, you lose ALL but the last couple episodes of the previous season and then you only have access to them for a limited number of days.   Very few episodes (maybe 2 or 3) of previous seasons are available to watch and even those change unexpectedly. 

I’ll be going back to my CBS All Access (which DOES give unlimited access to previous seasons) and will just have to catch the few NBC shows on the fly."
2020-09-03 14:55:00,Has Potential-But Buffering is Bad,2,itsjenjen,False,"Really enjoying the content, but the app needs work.

1-No picture in picture. It’s a pain that I have to stop watching a show any time I want to check something on the internet.

2-The layout could use work, especially in viewing mode. The “more episodes” feature starts with season one episode one, requiring the user to have to scroll left until the desired episode is reached. This can be a real task for shows like Murder, She Wrote, with 12 seasons, 22 episodes each.

3-Often lags when clicking on a selection to watch, with prolonged buffering. At times, especially during the day, my stream is interrupted by buffering, requiring me to restart app. I’ve gone through all the troubleshooting, to no avail. I have several other streaming services, and this is the only one that gives me trouble.

4-There is no link to the Watchlist. I can only find it if I’m in viewing mode, which is an unnecessary step.

5-Downloading is a much needed feature, especially if livestreams are interrupted by buffering."

Very little kids shows and movies, but decent content for adults.  Also has some original series that I have yet to check out. 
They already fixed the major glitches from when it launched three days ago, so it was great to see that they’re on top of it.  I’m sure they’ll make improvements and it will get even better.  Worth giving it a try if you’re looking for new or different kind of content to view."
2020-07-16 06:39:54,Content okay but app needs work,3,DCCuate,False,"The content is okay, though including only the last 8 seasons of the original Law & Order (by far, lesser in quality than first 6-8 seasons) is cheap. The app needs work. Specifically,
(1) the app should have a mini-player ability, so I can have it playing while I check another program;
(2) if there’s an extra charge for commercial free, then that should include commercials for Peacock itself. If I’m already using Peacock, I don’t need a 30-second commercial about Peacock; and
(3) the watchlist should be much easier to find and there should be ways to organize it (alphabetical, movie or tv...)."
2020-08-25 23:20:47,Losing Patience,2,Km678,False,"I am losing my patience with this app.  First, I was disappointed that I can only watch it on my iPhone/iPad since you don’t stream through such platforms as Roku.  Now it’s the commercials that are an annoyance.  When I first started using this app, there were no commercials at all.  Now not only are there far too many commercials, but the timing of them is completely off and will cut off a show mid-dialogue to go to a commercial, the show will come back for about two seconds and then will briefly go to a black screen where the commercial clearly was meant to me.  I would think that an app with NBC behind it would perform better than this one does."

Was not disappointed! Great movie, and same lovable cast! Was able to view it for free and without problems. I browsed through some of their other content and it looks like they have some good stuff/ fan favorites. I don’t watch too much TV anymore, but I really might keep this. Can’t believe there’s an option to stream good shows like this for free! Thanks Peacock! Love it!"
2020-09-26 02:56:55,Not very Apple-like,3,Dexter Davenport,False,"If you use this app on an iPad and you watch 4:3 content, it insets it rather than showing it full frame. I can understand top and bottom letterboxing on 16:9 content on a 4:3 screen, but 4:3 on a 4:3 screen should be full-screen. 

On Apple TV, it’s also very un-Apple. Most Apple-friendly apps have a menu that shows from the top that lets you change captioning and audio output. This app decides that you should pause it and use the onscreen controls at the bottom.

They should take Apple’s default design for a video streaming app and build on that. Make it specific for the device, not one size fits all."
2020-10-16 00:14:40,Incredibly mediocre,2,lpr2012,False,"I’m not sure why every network needs its own app now with really complicated subscription schemes. The exclusive programming is okay, not really great. I think the CBS exclusive programming is a lot more compelling.

The app itself looks pretty good, but is riddled with bugs. It’s incredibly slow and the streams have a lot of trouble transitioning around ads. They usually hang or crash coming out of ads (this may not be an issue if you’re paying for extra super duper premium). The stream stalls a lot too.

Finally, the app is not feature rich. There is no auto play features, downloads often don’t work, and there is no picture-in-picture support."
2020-08-25 18:29:58,It can be better.,3,mallory.kae,False,"Loves the shows, just a few issues. Sometimes I’ll close the app to do something and open it back up and it restarts episodes from the beginning when I’m over halfway done so I have to sit through all the ads again. When I’m looking for a new episode of a show I have to scroll through all the episodes instead of the menu opening up to the one I’m on or even giving me the option to choose a season. Finally, as I’m scrolling through the episodes they don’t have the titles listed, just “s1e1” or whatever. All things that other streaming apps have figured out."
2020-07-17 15:43:24,Great content limit to view,3,dmerner,False,As others have stated before the content is great availability is lacking now. I was super excited for Psych the movie two. I downloaded app on iPad (iPad Air 3rd generation) and was getting ready to stream on my new generation chromecast. I set everything up and hit play....the commercials streamed and me and my wife sat back ready to enjoy....about two minutes left tv went blank except audio. I guess streaming on chromecast blocked in beginning or something. To make sure it wasn’t my chromecast I tested with hbo max and Netflix and absolutely no problems. Hopefully this will be fixed to enjoy peacock to its fullest
2020-09-01 07:10:06,App needs to be more updated entertainment wise,2,names2989,False,"When using the app there are people in the younger generation who are into shows and movies that are more new and recent so the fact that when I’m searching for more new or recent titles and it says that there are “no results being found” just isn’t fair and doesn’t give people a variety of options. Also, even when paying for the premium service, there isn’t much that meets the eye or that really can entertain people, basically saying that there are other apps that mostly likely do so much better, and there’s no time to be spending money on something that isn’t as entertaining ; free or not."
2020-10-19 22:02:52,Purposely blocks screen mirroring & bad ads,2,giantorbsofdoom,False,"So let me get this straight... you built a STREAMING PLATFORM that you actively coded against being able to use screen mirroring on other devices while not adding apps on Samsung TV? 

So you, as a provider, claim you want people to use your product yet you actively block and don’t support a huge segment of the market. I don’t want to watch a movie on my phone when I should EASILY be able to airplay to my Samsung TV that you for some reason blocked. Absolutely stupid decision on your behalf that’s resulting in less ad exposure because I’m not going to use the app.

And furthermore... I get that I need ads if it’s a free version. That I can accept. What I can’t accept if you interrupting movies with ads left and right instead of just rolling unskippable ads before the video plays. Makes no sense to do it this way and actively makes me want to not use your product. Especially when your paid version apparently still has these horribly intrusive ads?

This was such a bad experience."
2020-07-15 19:13:52,Tough To Like,2,meanreviews,False,"It seems that peacock’s ONLY appeal is the library of shows and movies, which are difficult to find and watch. I downloaded the app this morning and was stunned by the lack of thought put into the user interface. Very little clarity on when live events will actually air, or how to play them. Certain channels worked without issue (the office for example) but others wouldn’t play at all. I tried both trial subscriptions and found nothing changed. Ended up watching the premier league on my old NBC Sports Gold which defeats the purpose of this new app. Please revisit the presentation and take a look at how FUBO TV does their interface for inspiration."

What I was missing was great content to stream in the background while cooking, cleaning, and other activities. Content that is engaging but doesn’t require your full attention. This service has that. The app works well on my old iPad, new iPad, iPhone X, 4K Apple TV, and an older Apple TV. There is a vast array of content and their commercials aren’t annoying or excessive. I’m happy with it!"

The peacock app is not available on our Samsung which is a few years old. No problem, we thought. We can use one of our Apple devices and mirror the soccer games onto the tv. Except that is a problem because  the peacock app blocks screen mirroring. So glad they gave us a 5 day free trial so we know we don’t want to pay for this service. Also, not interested in buying a dongle or other electronic gadget to try and solve this. If peacock wants our business, they need to make an app for our Samsung tv or allow us to screen mirror from our Apple device."

I subscribed to the ad-free tier and really like this.  There are quite a few movies, and I especially enjoy the Saturday Night Live catalog, it is fun to re-visit the classic shows.  They now have full seasons of other popular series, which were missing when they first launched.  There is enough programming to keep me entertained for a long time, I’m looking forward to watching!"
2020-10-17 06:40:39,Unusable,1,STUTLERTONI,False,"Completely unusable to me. All I watch on NBC is Dateline and it’s on there but there’s no air date for the episodes.  To find the most recent you have to use a different app to look up tv listings, take note of the episode title, come back to peacock, search for dateline and then scroll through all the episodes hoping one matches the episode title you’re looking for.  You can’t even search by episode title. Why is there no way to scroll through listings in the app and press play. Or have the episodes listed with most recently aired first? The season and episode number don’t mean anything when they’re not aired on TV in that order. I’m going back to using the old NBC app and hope they don’t discontinue it."
2020-10-02 15:59:37,Good start but not great,3,BeachBumPaule,False,"The app is functional which is great there are just some functions I wish they had;
1. They don’t have a recently watched list. I got this to watch parks and rec. and I don’t watch the whole series in one go do a recently watched list is helpful for that
2. I cast to my chromecast for most of my watching and it doesn’t automatically keep on playing the next episode. I can not find an auto play button either so it’s just annoying to have to play the next episode everytime. 

These are just two of the major problems I have with the app if they were fixed I’d give 5 stars and most of the time they will fix in time just frustrating that streaming service do not have this a launch. 
Besides that the app works great has amazing selections and the ads aren’t so many that I just want to delete the app, I probably won’t go to paid but it’s still a great way to watch things that aren’t on other services."
2020-07-29 22:44:02,Bad app. Good content,2,Masicyclist,False,"Impossible to binge if you’re casting. Every episode requires manual intervention. So, unlock the phone, find the app, scroll to the show, change from 100 episode list to just the next in series (otherwise you side scroll through every episode in every season), and continue watching. 
If you start an episode midway you get a pop up just as you’re pressing the cast button and you end up pressing ‘start from beginning”. It seems they didn’t test the UI. 
Also, audio gets out of sync with every episode. Rewind will fix it for 20-30 minutes. 
I’d rather not cast but Peacock doesn’t exist on any of my other devices."
2020-07-15 21:19:04,Horrible Livestream  Broadcast,1,AEslami,False,"I tried watching an EPL live soccer game and it was extremely frustrating and a very poor experience. The streaming would frequently freeze and restart with delay. I would get a goal notification and two minutes later see it happen. At times the video would freeze by sound was working. Several times I had to close and reopen the app to unfreeze. And finally with 10 minutes left I couldn’t open the stream no matter how many times I tapped the program. 
It’s a shame they removed the EPL games from NBCSN network to make it exclusive for peacock. 
I will watch the rest of season on a European broadcast using my VPN. 
I would never pay for this poor quality service."
2020-09-16 03:45:10,Great,4,CGrass222,True,"Started using this through Xfinity since day one. Worked flawlessly. Liked that the CC mimicked my customizations I made with Xfinity. 
Since September 10th. this app through Xfinity has sucked. It doesn’t connect and when it does it buffers endlessly. Now gives you a message that says it’s a third party app. When it does work it stops after every episode. And now the CC looks like crap. Hadn’t tried to AirPlay or Cast with the iOS app but I tried AirPlay tonight it obviously didn’t work. It was a great app through Xfinity but now it’s ehh. Please undo what you’ve done and stop trying to fix what wasn’t broken. Now it’s broken.

Update. 
Realized it was something on my end with the CC and found out we were experiencing internet issues last week. Still don’t like that you can’t AirPlay. Luckily I have a TV to Cast with. 
Bumped it from a 2 star to 4 star. 
Will add the extra star once AirPlay works."
2020-08-07 15:29:27,Content great. The app needs some work,2,Mine2too,False,"The app is pretty good but there are some weaknesses. There is way to make a watchlist. There is a continue watching list but it does work right. If I cast a show from the continue watching list, it will play from the time marked on the continue watching list, but it will not update the continue watching list to my new progress. If I finish a show and try to go to the next episode using the continue watching list, it will return to the same place as before.  To watch the next episode, I have to search for it. Peacock also lacks a means to give feedback other than app reviews, Hence I wrote this review."
2020-08-18 09:08:37,Good price but need major work,3,promyk,False,"I like how premium plus is only 10 bucks so far but WHY do you have random episodes missing from a series?! It’s just crazy and infuriating. I can’t move forward because episodes are missing and there is no way to get them other than purchasing them on prime video. Out of 20 two somewhere in a middle will be missing. For each season. Madness 🤬🤪😩

As far as the appgoes, please incorporate previews of what you fast forward or rewind to, so it’s easier to tell where to stop. 

Peacock for shield also needs work. Remote buttons aren't corresponding properly."
2020-07-15 17:36:41,Simple but yet a long way to go,2,KingBassy,False,"I watch the premier league games on this app and I watch them with AirPods on. Every time this disconnects, the game pauses and it does not have a play button anywhere on the app to resume. So i have to close and start from scratch every time. Also if you switch apps to text and then try to open the app back up, it kicks you back to the main menu, even if you never closed this app. Other than that, it looks nice and I like the idea of switching to any game I want. (Games that show off air aren’t really off air, their menus don’t update quick enough to tell you a match has started)."
2020-07-21 05:17:20,"Works well, but needs more",3,Michael36743,False,"The app works well and does what it needs to. I love the free tier. The functionality of the app could use a little more work though. Taking a cue from Netflix, I would love to see this app allow the user to remove movies/shows from the continue watching list so that shows I’ve just started don’t remain if I decide I don’t want to continue them. This is just one small example of the lack of user experience oriented features that this app currently exhibits. Hopefully in a few weeks or months they’ll add more features to enhance our viewing experience."
2020-09-20 16:18:02,Garbage App,1,Linkjmu,False,"I downloaded recently and signed up for a subscription to watch Premier League. This in it self is a travesty because apparently no games are available on cable this season. Now to the app... every time i want to watch a game i have to re-download the app and sign in with all my credentials. This is because when i open the app it is stuck on the last game i watched and there is no way to back out of it to the main menu.

So to summarize: Premier League is now only available on Peacock and not via cable so thats not good. I have to pay minimum $4.99 a month to watch games now, not good. And the one that grinds my gears the most is that the PEACOCK app doesnt even work, not good at all. Come on NBC please fix this."
2020-07-17 02:52:30,Disappointing,1,Reptileman81,False,"I pre bought this streaming subscription for a free app, and already felt dumb for that. Then on launch day I realize we can only watch from our phones. My house has 5 iPhones, 3 fire tablets, 4 roku TVs 2 fire sticks and a 2012 Vizio, and we can’t watch this app. I bought a cast app to get my iPhone to cast to my tv and peacock still wouldn’t cast, everything else from my phone did, until I opened peacock. We used a HDMI cord from the tv to to a laptop and got an error message. We knew our living room tv was old, we had no clue it was a 2012 until trying this app. Now I feel like I need to buy a different tv or a Apple TV box to watch a free app that I paid for. Thanks for making me feel stupid peacock."
2020-07-15 14:45:55,"Good Content, Needs User Profiles",3,TC30726,False,"I like the content Peacock has to offer, but the fact that it doesn’t have user profiles is an issue. It needs that urgently. It also needs 4K (for compatible shows and devices) and mobile downloads. To the issue of user profiles, once they do get released, there’s going to be a bunch of content on one person’s profile that the whole family had watched for the past month (or however long it takes for them to release this feature). So there also needs to be a way to edit watch history as well."
2020-08-26 17:29:06,"Easy to sign up, impossible to cancel",1,rlfisher84@gmail,False,"We got this to watch Yellowstone. Easy to setup and they gladly take your money each month.  They even provide a button to start your subscription on their home page,  HOWEVER bait and switch you by making it almost impossible to stop your subscription.  There is no way to really “cancel” your subscription.  You can mail a letter in via snail mail (seriously, can’t believe that’s even an option in 2020) Frankly, this should be a crime.  I would avoid the app or business with them until they make it easy to cancel or else you will be stuck with paying the monthly service without the ability to cancel."
2020-07-21 01:41:19,One of the worst apps I’ve ever used,1,hayemhay,False,"This is by far one of the worst apps I’ve ever used. In fact, I am not sure I can even go as far as saying “I used” the app because it kept glitching. I tried casting to my tv, as well as using several different platforms (Vizio, Xbox, and other platforms it is listed as compatible with). I am sure the content is lovely but it won’t play. We got it to play a movie at one point and got the whole 2 minutes of ads clear as day and then it froze and went back to the home screen. We tried again thinking it may have been a problem on our end, checked the WiFi, and all the tv connections, and it happened again. NBC do better."
2020-09-19 20:37:26,Poor Streaming Experience,4,Dmmdmb,True,"I signed on for Premier League games. Two games in and the user experience is poor. As bad as twelve to fourteen seconds of “live” play then buffering. When the net delay is minutes the app drops to cast ready, on restart there is a time warp to current. Pass for first weekend of PL reasonable to the expiration of the 7-day trial reasonable. Looking forward to upscale of capabilities to remove air-quotes from “live”.

Week 2: Update... 1 up to 4 stars.
No delays today. It looks like they have wrung out the issues since last weekend."
2020-09-11 01:22:08,All I care about,1,J0hnny75,False,"Is watching the EPL live.  And these muppets apparently have the rights to it but I have no idea where to find the games.  I have logged in to the premium subscription, and they have my cc details.  But they are too busy putting “funny” comments on their website about whether peacocks can fly and how many eggs they lay and what i really want to know is which games they are showing this weekend.  But the search function is so poor you cannot find anything.  You can me watching something, go and search for it and there are no results.  Peacock YOU ARE MUPPETS.  Muppets.  It defies belief that something so important could be left in the hands of such a bunch of toss pots.  Sort it out."
2020-08-13 04:56:00,Very Disappointed-need to work out the AirPlay kinks out,1,ShahB,False,"I have an old Apple TV so I couldn’t download the app on it. So I downloaded it on my iPhone X and was ready to stream a movie. 
It connected to my Samsung pretty easily and I watch the first part of the movie until a commercial kicks in. It disconnected and then started a whole new set of commercials. Then the movie started playing in fast forward. Super fast forward. So I quit the app and did the whole thing again. Same thing. I did it again!! That’s three times now of 5-7 minutes each time. 
I then quit and I’m done. 
Bad user experience. Need to QA and figure out commercials implementation across platforms. 
Kinda of sad for such a large app."
2020-07-22 05:05:13,Lots Left To Get Right,1,Mindovo.com,False,If you are going to charge for a commercial free tier it has to actually be free of commercials. When video is viewed on a late model iPhone with no home button the home “line” at the bottom of the screen never disappears. Video is too small with too much letter boxing and no way to fill the screen via zoom for a larger image. App design is too complicated. Need “Browse” to be default view and Watchlist to be one of three main buttons via bottom navigation. I tried to submit the above as feedback but there was no easy way to do so via the app or via the website even though I tried - just ran into a useless chatbot offering pretend customer service.
2020-08-10 11:31:37,"Love this app, really free",4,twistedchix,False,"Ok so first off- I really love this app. I love the fact that it is actually free... some streaming apps advertise to be free, but only the app download is free and access any material you have to ‘pick a plan’. With Peacock, you can just opt to watch commercials.  Lots of my favorite crime shows... the biggest issue I have seen with the app- on PlayStation 4, when watching a tv series, the episode will randomly stop 3-4 minutes early, it will continue to play when you go back into the episode however it is semi- frustrating..."
2020-08-12 03:56:19,Super disappointed,2,Katehg,False,So far I’m super disappointed in this service! Paid the $5/month - so I knew there would still be commercials.... however every time it gets to a commercial break it goes back to the 16 min mark in the episode - then when we try to move it back to where we were it makes us watch the commercials again - then it sends us right back to the 16 minute mark so we can’t even get through an entire episode that we’re trying to watch!! I think we’ve seen the commercials 85 times each!! It’s taken us an hour and a half to watch an hour long show!! Very frustrating!!!!!
2020-10-02 05:20:28,Meh,1,AlanHughes,False,"Every time you open the app you have to go on a wild scavenger hunt trying to find your watchlist. It isn't listed in the top menu or bottom menu, it's just where ever they feel like dropping it today. How did this possibly get approved? I assume NBC has an entire team working on this, and nobody caught it? Or did you possibly some how think this was actually a good idea?

With the website you can at least bookmark the watchlist page, but I have an older iMac that just isn't powerful enough to run this website. It plays video. Computers in 1999 could play video. What could you possibly be trying to do that makes this website so bloated it can't even play video???"
2020-09-23 23:04:04,Where is the 0 stars option?,1,Mr. Quiche,False,"I find the approach of exploiting cable/streaming subscribers who already pay for NBCSN by holding them hostage to also need to pay for peacock premium in order to watch the majority of premiere league coverage to be absolutely sickening. You’re double-dipping in the midst of an economic crisis.  I went from an almost universally positive opinion of NBC Sports to the complete opposite, and I’m not alone. Way to go, I hope it was worth it.

Also, I have some feedback on user experience that I would normally share to help improve the experience but I really have no desire to help this greedy little venture of yours succeed in any way so I’ll keep it to myself.  The gist is...it’s not great."
2020-10-04 18:17:36,I want this app to be great!,4,MitchJohnston,False,"Very excited for this app!!! At first sight.... great content, great looking UI...  just frustrating to use. 
If watching a multi season show, pressing the more episodes button takes the user back to season1 Ep 1... time consuming and just novice like. 
Also, how about a homepage? Bookmark link?  
And most of all...I really thought the Last thing a paying subscriber would ever have to ask for is “play in the background”  
I’m sure it’s a work in progress and I’ll stay as long as possible!"
2020-07-25 20:35:39,"Garbage, don’t waste your time our money!",1,Nupe1233,False,"I downloaded this app with great hopes and looking for original content. Well during the trial you don’t have access, the original content only stuff that is already provided by many other apps. Therefore, I wanted to drop this before the trial ended. Well here is where it got bad. There is no way to drop from the app or the site! They don’t have any contact number available. Then they funneled me to a chat but the chat is with a bot with preprogrammed responses to pick from, they don’t have the respect to chat with a real person. Then they have the gall to send an email request for feedback on their customer service! Freaking ridiculous!"
2020-07-15 03:00:29,Incredible content! How is this free?,5,Ryancsmi,False,"I can’t believe that all of my favorite content is finally free! From all of the timeless classics I loved growing up (Saved by the Bell!!) to iconic shows like 30 Rock (my fave), Peacock has so much to watch.  

I can’t wait to dive into all of this content. I have tons to get through even before The Office drops in 2021! 

I’ve been so excited for this app to release (saw the advertisements everywhere) and it does not disappoint. I literally can’t not watch."
2020-07-26 05:41:50,UX needs a lot of work,2,ryankoncar,False,"I enjoy the content available on peacock, but the app on Apple TV is horrible. It doesn’t skip forward/back 10sec when clicking left/right on the remote; it doesn’t interface with Siri (e.g. hey Siri go back 10 seconds) to show closed captioning; doesn’t highlight a border or otherwise indicate what episode your cursor is on when scrolling; the time elapsed/duration bar while watching a movie stalls (e.g. stops counting at 34:31 even those 2:08 movie length); much more. Right now it’s only useful for basic functionality—click play and let it go. Literally *anything* beyond clicking play is not intuitive."
2020-09-13 14:04:29,Broken Login and Bad Password Management,1,Mad Chipmunk,False,"After spending a while trying to login on the Apple TV and later iOS, I gave up and uninstalled the Peacock app on all platforms.

On the website, you can create a long password. Peacock doesn’t say the limit, but that limit is definitely longer than what the Apple TV and iOS apps will accept. Good luck logging in.

I tried changing my password, by Peacock doesn’t appear to like password managers. The website makes you type your password to verify to verify the one you’re using. This is bad security. Period. Peacock apparently wants you to choose a password you can remember and type. Numbers and letters are good. So, if you want to use “Password12,” then Peacock is your jam.

What makes this even worse is that, when you’re logged in to the website and choose the option to reset your password, you can’t simply do it from your account settings. Nope. Peacock will email you a magic link. Plan to invest even more time.

I’m not willing to invest anymore time in this."
2020-08-21 12:42:12,Basic Updates Needed,2,N Zyggy,False,"Please update to allow fit to screen and picture in picture features.  Even shows in 4:3 format on an iPad screen should already fill the screen but it’s a small box in the middle of the screen (someone formatted the original format into a 16:9 format).  Picture in picture is available on almost every video app and has been an iPad (and soon iPhone feature) since 2015.  A flagship app should have at least these basic features (and flagship features).   Navigating to browse content is also a little clunky, especially in terms of video topics."
2020-10-14 21:00:20,Terrible App!,1,RonHeiden,False,"The content on Peacock is great however the app is absolutely the worst. It never returns to the correct show when continuing to watch. It doesn’t allow us to go to a specific episode either. If it’s there somewhere I can’t find it. It doesn’t allow skipping the openings of shows like every other app n the world does. It doesn’t allow skipping to the next episode like every other app in the world does.

Have considered upgrading to the $9.99 premium package but they warn that there will still be adds. Why? I thought we we would be paying to get add free content. Seriously hesitating to upgrade because all the app’s problems will still be present."
2020-10-04 02:08:03,"Terrible App, terrible service",1,mcbear5548,False,"Peacock is hot trash, it’s the worst of all the streaming services I use. They never put up the Premier League replays on time, and when they are finally up they don’t work. You can’t pause live tv even though I’ve had that option on cable for 15 years, you can’t rewind either. If you want to watch a specific episode of a show you have to click the first one and click through each episode as it auto plays until you get to the right one. I hate this service. I hate it so much. It is terrible in browser and as an app. If I wasn’t forced to have this to watch Premier League I would never ever ever use it again."
2020-07-15 03:14:52,It’s a good streaming service for Xfinity owners,5,DjPhantom2158,False,So if you were one of the people who got Peacock Premium for free then you gonna love it. It has Live TV and you don’t have to pay extra because it’s Live TV (finally). The UI looks pretty good and it works for the iPhone Notch Screens and for the newer iPads. It has good content like Shrek and Parks and Rec. More content are coming soon but the content right now is pretty good. Overall it’s a good way to start a streaming service.
2020-10-11 23:03:20,Paying customer at premium - many issues,1,E. R.,False,"Still have ads on most everything. No way to skip ads if it crashes in the middle and you need to jump back to where you were.

But the worse problem is that you can jump forward at all (it’s treated as jump back 5 seconds). And you can jump back but to go back a minute takes 20 or 30 quick clicks in the pause play menu while selecting the timeline.

The interface is horrible, un-intuitive and archaic. I paid for the discounted 1 year but otherwise I’d have cancelled due to the lack of functional jump forward/backward 10 or 30 seconds feature."
2020-09-13 21:41:35,Faulty with chrome cast,2,KISHADAM,False,"It is not easy casting this app. It disconnects in the middle of the show, and casting issues is something I never have to deal with. If you do not catch the next show flag at the end of the episode you have to go back into the app and find the next episode. You cannot binge (you have to select every show it does not continuously play) and that’s what streaming is known for now. Not very user friendly and lots of kinks but good show offerings with short commercials. After watching the giant streaming company’s for years it’s easy to see this app has a long way to go!!"
2020-10-13 20:11:20,5 Stars,5,mikayla mahan,False,"I see a lot of negative reviews for this app, but personally I LOVE it. It actually is free and the movies and shows are actually good. There is “premium” which some things, you do have to pay for. But that’s like most streaming services, not everything is free. Free content is still A+. App layout isn’t the cleanest I’ve seen but it is still functional and easy to find things. 10/10 recommend to everyone."
2020-07-22 23:35:40,Older ChromeCast support please,4,harrytheplatypus,False,"The app is great but I would like to bring attention to an issue with connecting to the older model ChromeCast. 

The device shows up in the app and tries to connect when triggered. The TV screen (on the ChromeCast input) then turns black like it’s trying to connect but after a minute of black it reverts back to the ChromeCast home screen. On the phone the ChromeCast icon shows it’s not casting. 

It would be nice if a ticket could be addressed by IT to fix this. I am excited to use Peacock on my TV!"
2020-07-16 23:29:05,It’s a new app,5,Alpha Jazz Saxophone,False,"Peacock is actually pretty good for a free streaming app that isn’t even a week old, yes the display could use some touch ups and it would be nice to have multiple profiles under the same account, but these are small details that can be updated in the future. Many people are complaining about its features but it hasn’t even received its first major update. I think it’s quality for how new it is."
2020-10-08 23:24:00,Good service. Terrible app.,1,strunk,False,"I mainly use this app on Apple TV, and while the overall layout and menus aren’t bad, the fact that this app doesn’t use standard Apple TV playback controls makes it an absolute nightmare to use. 

I frequently use the left / right click on the trackpad remote to jump back or forward 10 seconds, but since the app uses their own playback controls instead of Apple’s, this doesn’t work. So while every single other app I use on my Apple TV works one way, this app doesn’t, which makes it so painful to use. 

I’d they’d just standardize that with the rest of the system, my rating would improve significantly."
2020-10-08 07:08:45,This is a nice streaming service with lots of good content,5,Desert2011,True,"This is a revision of a previous review. The app has added the ‘watch list’ and ‘continue watching’ under the ‘Browse’ tab. This makes it much, much easier to use. I like the content of the free version and will most likely pay for premium. I look forward to new shows being added. It is a nice new streaming service."
2020-09-13 14:50:56,"Can’t watch on Samsung, Poor Interface, search play",2,Sanfranlubs,False,"This app has so many faults for NBC’s big push. Bought it to watch Premier League Soccer, not compatible with Samsung TV, no app for tv. Must get a Chromecast to cast and watch. WHY?!? I am paying to watch and want this in my big tv. 

Also so hard to find the shows. What is Channels - Trending - Browse? Why can’t I favorite my channels, then I pick Premier League and no games listed just the pregame shows. What the hell??? How hard are you going to make it to find games. 

Such a poor design - nbcsports app was so much better organized. Really really really backwards and poor."
2020-08-25 23:45:24,Problems from the start,1,Caseysue20,False,"App has has major problems since it launched. At first it wouldn’t cast to my chromecast. It would connect for 1-2 seconds and then drop even though other apps on the same device have no issue. So I waited...several weeks. Now it will cast and I can start watching  something, but the video freezes every couple of minutes. The audio keeps going and I can get the video back if I hit the 10 second back button, but having to do it every couple minutes makes it unusable. Can’t wait for this app to get lined out since I have paid for a full year of the service.."
2020-07-16 00:35:45,Underdelivered is an understatement,1,TopherIsMe,False,"I’ve been excited about getting service for a couple of months now since I love the universal monster movies and nbc sitcoms of years past.  I pre ordered the top tier package ($50 a year more the other package) because I hate commercials.  First movie I try to watch, Brewster’s Millions and there’s 3 minutes of commercials before I can even watch this movie that came out 30+ years ago.  I am livid and I want my money back.  I’d almost forgive an occasional commercial if the selection of film and tv wasn’t so terrible.  I should have never spent money on this app, it’s clearly the worst streaming platform on the market."
2020-07-17 18:31:52,Great for an app that’s just been launched!,5,Lee56232,False,"There’s a ridiculous number of complaints being written for a free app, just out of the box. 
The quantity of free streaming shows is very impressive.  NBC could have easily made this a fully subscription application, but chose to include a limited number of ads and make it free.  No doubt that current complaints about lack of ROKU support will be addressed in a future update.  
This is definitely a winner....thanks NBC!"
2020-07-20 01:36:36,Doesn’t connect to my chrome cast tv,4,arg601,False,"I wanted to watch my favorite show on my tv, and when I saw that the app supported chrome cast, I was extremely excited...until it didn’t fully connect and couldn’t play the episode, so I wasn’t able to watch anything from the Peacock app on my television. I know this is a new app and all so I don’t want to be harsh, but I hope this could be fixed in the next update. Other than that, I really enjoy the content this app has!!"
2020-09-11 13:34:42,This app is terrible,1,tinawpdx,False,"Here it is. I have enjoyed some of the content. For example, I wanted to watch Battlestar Galactica again. But the user interface on the appletv is so horrible that I watch anything on any other streaming service first. The simplest thing, a brief rewind because you were away too long in a commercial is practically impossible on the appletv. Not because you can’t, but because the typical back ten seconds / forward ten seconds does not work. You have to use the app scrubber which has almost no control. 

I could go on, suffice to say I skip this app in favour of watching anything else. Fix your stuff, NBC."
2020-08-12 17:44:35,Subtitles,4,TobellamaDee,False,"Dear Peacock. I tried to contact you by going to the website and clicking help, but your bot was in no way able to provide me the answers I needed. I actually want to tell you that your subtitle in the series “The Capture” on episode 1 was out of sync. I just wanted to tell you that and there is no way I can leave a suggestion anywhere or contact you to tell you that. Maybe you can hire me to quality check your subtitles ;) hehe. The series is interesting BTW. ^_^"
2020-07-26 00:53:32,Unfortunate,2,Scrabble in NY,False,"I would have liked to start watching shows on Peacock, but unfortunately, they’re not on ROKU, and they don’t work with my older version of Apple TV.  The only way for me to watch is on my iPhone 11, and unfortunately, I want to watch on a tv screen.  They’ve also arranged it so that you can’t screen mirror the Peacock shows from your iPhone to the older Apple TV.  All of my other entertainment apps work perfectly well with screen mirroring.  I guess NBC isn’t as serious about entering the streaming business as the other big players.  I’ll be sticking with the other guys..."
2020-07-30 02:07:11,Peacock needs to allow users to opt out of auto play,4,tima31584,False,"It is an incredibly tedious thing to have to find where you left off in your watching history. Peacock gives you perhaps 15 seconds before it streams the next episode. And it will keep streaming until it’s played every episode. So when I go back to keep watching a show, I don’t know where I am, all the episodes have been marked played while I was sleeping. And you’re lost."
2020-08-26 05:30:33,"Not great, could be better",2,cstl257,False,"Just discovered Peacock and free streaming is awesome BUT there are definitely problems to be fixed. So far what’s bothering me is 1) When an ad starts to play you can’t seem to change episodes? Hit the back arrow and it takes you back to the home screen, hit pause and the ad pauses, and there’s nothing else you can do. 2) discrepancies in play history. When I back out of an episode, there’s no guarantee that next time it’ll start where I left off. 3) maybe I just haven’t figured this out, but how do you fast forward and backward??"
2020-10-09 15:42:12,Worst of any streaming app.  Who would pay for this?,2,Strega111,False,"It begins with less than smooth multi step process of associating with your cable carrier account.
After that it buffers a lot (when others don’t)—the ‘Continue Watching’ is there sometimes—and other times it isn’t. 
Often just closes/crashes. It doesn’t support Picture in Picture. 
Also often when you see something featured you can’t just click on it to view it-no ‘watch it now’ and you have to type title into search to bring it up and watch it."

2020-07-15 12:17:32,No ROKU Or Background Listning,2,Curtis R. Shideler,False,"I am tired of more and more streaming services fracturing our wallets and attention. However, I love some NBC/Universal content a lot. 

On Mobile I would use this app IF it allowed for background listening. If I want to listen to a soccer match, tv show, or news while I do something else or even work, I can’t. In 2020, every streaming platform needs background listening support in their free tier. How else am I even going to spend enough time in the app to realize I need it?!

But my family watches content on ROKU on three televisions. So, without ROKU support, Peacock is useless."
2020-08-09 20:15:09,No mirror/airplay and have to continuously search,1,SaiyukiJ,False,"I was super excited by the price and content of this streaming service. However since spending some time streaming I am not happy with a couple things. I am not happy that you cannot mirror/airplay to your Apple TV from your phone, sound will come through but video will not which seems to be a problem several people are having. Also, unlike with other streaming services, I have to constantly go and find the show I was watching and the episode. It does not have a continue watching feature that pulls up when you open the app."
2020-07-15 06:03:51,Basic Features,2,ME43665644,False,"Missing Profiles for family, the Playing Interface on Apple TV is finicky at best and refuses to pause at worst. Scrubbing through a show is almost impossible as there is no preview box. The selection of content is decent but most of what I want to watch can be found on other streaming services I’ve already signed up to use. Which leaves the only content I want to watch on the app locked behind the premium account. This would be fine and I’ll consider upgrading once user profiles are added and the bugs are fixed."
2020-10-04 12:46:13,Peacock EPL COVERAGE IS A RIP OFF!,2,Adamakirby,False,"Obviously NBC is after a money grab.  No premier league mornings can’t watch a game I missed until they post replay at 9:00 that night just spend money on dish and record game watch at your convenience  in 2020 how does a company as big and powerful as NBC not allow for immediate viewing of a game, ridiculous.  If anyone at Peacock reads this you have to know not only is your product have technical issues (streaming issues) but the way you have set up your EPL games is unjust, and unfair to us EPL fans, wish you’d do better but I have no faith that you will."
2020-10-20 14:00:25,Play on Roku,4,elijaha6570,False,I would buy the paid version if I could watch on my Roku. Thanks for the free version. I really enjoy the shows you let me watch for free. Please make a auto play option. I like to be in control of my shows. I fall asleep at night and several episodes have done played. I like the option to stop all episodes on their own without me having to hit cancel. Having profiles would be nice on the Roku too. Thank you!
2020-09-14 20:23:09,Garbage,2,J2_D2,False,"This app is complete garbage. Not only is it not available on almost all the most popular devices, they actually make you pay for watching premium content that you have to jump through hoops to watch. The app itself is poorly organized and almost impossible to find anything. I had to stream from my phone to my Chromecast and the buffering was almost non stop and unwatchable. They really need to make this better and available on all devices like Samsung TVs and Rokus before you ask to charge for premium content. Disappointing."
2020-09-26 07:58:43,Love it now,5,JDhaliwal,False,Changing my review from before. Sorry for the hate. But freakin love this app. The quality is awesome and even if you miss a premier league then you can still watch the whole game in replays. And it’s handy. You have the app on the phone so you can use it anywhere. Hope the monthly price stays the same. App does needs some improvements but in time I am sure you guys will nail it. Satshriakal
2020-07-16 10:41:48,The news section needs work,2,izzy*b,False,"Obviously, it is great that a free version is being offered. I was hoping for better access to news stations... more content compared to the NBC News app. But, there are still only highlights for the MSNBC programs. Worse, you can not see their title or what date they aired. The automatic playlist is an irritant.

Please, add full MSNBC shows... I would be a paying customer if that was available. Add dates for all news related programing. Do not have sections that begin to play before you choose what you want to watch! Add a preference to turn off autoplay."
2020-10-05 04:28:27,Not IPhone X and further compatible,2,rupert.muson,False,"The app lacks so many features that I like to use with my newer iPhone. Not only is it impossible to fully zoom it in, there is about a centimeter gap at the bottom of my screen that’s just black for no reason. The fact that it doesn’t resume episodes at the right time is also very aggravating. And where many other streaming apps have the capability to go to home and still be able to watch it while scrolling in a smaller box ,this app completely lacks that ability"
2020-07-17 04:59:21,"It’s okay, needs work.",3,MacFresh850,False,"The library selection is vast. The UI needs work to better navigate through the offerings. People are complaining about the limited support on their smart devices like roku, Apple TV, etc. I will tell you that you people need to get a chromecast and stop complaining. You bought an device you think you can get everything on. Sorry but casting came first with Chromecast. So go pick up one for $30 bucks and you’ll never have to worry about an app not being supported."
2020-08-19 12:02:41,Horrible interface,1,Tcboober,False,"The interface of how you search for shows, you can’t view live TV, trying to search through multiple seasons of a show and the overall layout is difficult at best. It was not well thought out and you can tell they saw how everyone else didn’t it and said we want to be different. Mission accomplished you are different. There is a reason so many of the TV app all do it the same way because it works. You accomplished in being the worst TV app I have and I subscribe to must of them. I hope that you review these and make the necessary changes soon."
2020-08-18 12:51:53,I’m changing my review from 2 stars to five,5,meowgal,False,"I was one of the first downloaders and I admit, I wasn’t too happy. But after about 10 days or so the app really got good, and I’ve been binge watching some old shows I grew up with.

One minor complaint. I’m watching on an iPad, and I wish there was a volume button on the screen like Netflix has. 

I also wish you’d have all 20 seasons of “Law and Order” . I love Lenny Briscoe."
2020-08-11 02:03:28,Great movies and shows,4,PortugeeStud1982,False,"The free content available [to cable customers] is great! The app features a multitude of programs to satiate war/history buffs, like myself. Along with virtually countless dramas and comedies for the spouse and the little ones won’t be left out either. My only critic is the platform/visual (GUI) set up of the app itself. For example, the ""My Watchlist"" tab is non-existent nor is there an actual ""Home"" screen. All-in-all this is good app even tho it needs some visual edits."
2020-07-17 21:21:59,Can’t Watch,1,CountryAg96,False,"I paid for this a few months ago.  At that time it stated that it would be available on 2019 Smart TVs.  After I signed up for the most expensive level of no ads they must have clarified brands.  So my Samsung TV is a no go.  No problem.  I have Airplay2 on the Regular NBC app so no problem.  Except that there is no Airplay2 icon when playing a show on the new app.  So I try screen mirror.  It will play the ads at the beginning just fine but then when the actual show plays, the tv goes black but the audio is still there.  Ugh. So they will need to fix this or I will cancel and dispute the charge."
2020-07-15 22:23:14,Don’t complain if your not paying,5,katarinaelizabeta,False,"It has soo many good shows and movies for free, it was just released so of corse it’s going to have a few things it will need to change as it goes on but since I’m only using the free version I don’t have the right to complain about that. (Though it’s not much) as someone who can’t afford streaming services or cable I appreciate this app very much"
2020-09-15 19:15:39,Terrible UI on Apple TV,2,PacoDude12345678,False,Content is great. But the UI on Apple TV is horrendous. Why does it not use the normal playback controls that basically every other streaming app uses? No left/right click to skip backwards/forwards. No simple “click and swipe” to scrub through the timeline. Instead there’s a clunky and unintuitive way to do this (without a thumbnail of the content as you’re scrubbing) and no good visual indication if you’re even in scrubbing mode or adjusting some other setting. It’s really terrible.  Just clicking play mostly works but even then it is pretty flaky.
2020-10-20 20:07:22,WON’T EVEN LET ME CREATE AN ACCOUNT,1,AshlynIgnoria667,False,I have tried to create an account but it won’t let me! It continues to say I already have an account even after I created an new email!  When I try to contact an agent it glitches and I can’t see the chat!   It is ridiculous!  This isn’t the first time I have try to make an account!  I had trues online and in app!  I deleted the app and re-downloaded it.  It never helped! I tried on my computer as well as my phone Incase it wasn’t compatible with my device and it still never changed!! I would greatly appreciate if you would solve this problem!! Thank you in advance!!!!
2020-10-14 22:12:53,Disgusted,5,Radzek,False,NBC has the audacity of having Trump do his Town-hall “debate” while still being infectious. NBC catered to Trump’s complaining and will put this on at the same time Biden is doing his Town-hall all for ratings and Ad revenue. Trump is a coward for not debating Biden per the agreed schedule and NBC are a bunch of cowards for placating to Trump. I will watch Biden on ABC and I hope Biden buys an ad telling people to switch over to a reputable station to watch a real presidential candidate.
2020-09-20 13:12:14,"Sad, inadequate, not worth 1 cent",1,hello monkey,False,"Limited Premier League content
Premier League Coverage split across three separate platforms. 
No guide function
Can only see programming one hour ahead
Locks up to black screen often
NO portrait mode so you can scan channels while watching
NO background viewing or audio
NO picture in picture
Search function is useless. Type in Premier League get zero results even though its on in 44 minutes. Type in Soccer and only get Womens Soccer as a result without any of the other games on the service

Yes it is a streaming service. A service of mystery, no sole source for Premier League, we were forced to get this useless service with less coverage and features if we wanted anything more than 1 game a week. 

Instead of a nimble, accessible streaming service with robust search, guide, and at least as much coverage of EPL  as last years Gold we have a mishmosh of shows with no easily navigated organization. Its Crap. 

Sad."
2020-09-20 12:20:02,Room for improvement,2,Grodzman,False,"The app itself is more or less fine, however for my personal main usage (streaming premier league) it’s not very good. Navigating to the game you want to watch can be difficult (grouping/categories unclear). Once there, game replays are not immediately available. Games do not have rewind controls or play/pause. Finally, there seems to be no way to AirPlay the game to a nearby TV. There’s a big opportunity to make this the go-to PL experience. NBC Sports provided line-ups, statistics, and all of the above, so this is a major step back in experience."
2020-09-02 07:59:21,Confusing Controls on Apple TV,3,Meshari T.,False,"For a user paying $10/mo, this is a poor quality app with lots of superior alternatives. The playback controls on the Apple TV app are very awkward and confusing, Peacock app shouldn’t reinvent it’s own controls when major apps like Netflix and Prime use Apple TV’s native controls and gestures for selecting subtitles, scrubbing (rewind and fast forward), it’s very difficult to scrub to a specific time when you can barely see the extremely small timers on a large screen."
2020-08-15 09:43:31,Annoyed and Disappointed,1,CenNicJai,False,"I have Apple TV on my iPhone and downloaded this Peacock TV app. It’s my first time doing so, so I do not have an account. However, every time I try to sign up, I keep getting the same error message that “we’re having a problem” blah, blah, blah. I’ve tried restarting my phone three times and still get the same error message. It’s a waste of time advertising an app that you can’t even log into. I tried to contact the “Support Team” pertaining to this issue but didn’t get anywhere with that either. I would love this Give app 0 stars but it won’t allow you to do so and still post a review #VERYDISSATISFIED"
2020-09-06 02:46:33,Not so good,2,Photobill,False,"You would think that a big company like NBC would read, respond and fix the complaints about this app.   The app opens and plays on my iPad.  When I try to mirror it to my TV through an Apple TV generation 3, I am able to see and hear the ads on my TCL TV, but when the show begins I can still hear the audio, but my TV screen only shows the last black frame of the ad with “0” showing on the countdown timer.   The show continues to play on my iPad screen but does not mirror to the TV.  Very frustrating and disappointing."
2020-07-21 15:42:22,Can airplay commercials but not actual content,2,Snowbnd13,False,"Like so many others have said, we tried to stream this via “airplay” from a phone to our Apple TV. The commercials played fine and then went to a black screen with only audio for the actual movie. 
We then tried to play it from the website on a laptop and it started the first commercial and froze. This could in part be a slow connection, but after that the site only said “An error occurred,” “Content not found,” etc.
We still haven’t seen Psych 2!
Please fix."
2020-08-24 05:30:17,I think this a good app,5,ZXx_hi_xXZ,False,I really like this app if your a mom there’s some kids shows this is a good app I don’t know why people are putting 1 stars but I give this a 5 if you don’t like it witch I don’t know why you wouldn’t like it but if you don’t like it then delete it for me this is a good app my favorite tv show is fail army or something but can you put some more movies plzzz
2020-09-28 03:32:53,Annoying Interface,2,Lisa Weseman,False,"Gorgeous interface that drives me nuts. I’m on a paid plan, but when I open the app I don’t see “continue watching.” Have to click to Browse (?) and then I only see the last episode in progress. If I’m not sure it’s the right one (I’m binging so maybe fell asleep or got distracted) I can’t read the description there, I have to click back to series then toggle to the current season and scroll to find the episodes I’m on. How has every other streaming app figured out a better way to do this? Doesn’t seem hard."
2020-07-18 22:49:29,Limited Device Streaming,3,hereforPsych,False,"Peacock is not currently available as an app on Samsung TVs. In an effort to still view the new Psych movie on our tv, we downloaded the app on both an iPhone and Macbook to mirror to the tv. The app is viewable on the TV as well as the ads before the movie. But as soon as the movie begins, the video cuts out, rendering it completely useless. We still watched the movie on the laptop, but it’s frustrating to see so much hype over this app and not even get to use it on our tv. Very disappointing."
2020-07-18 19:26:23,Commercials,2,heisifiwjfheksjfoeofgdd,False,"Soooo I had seen multiple commercials for this app anddd I was like I might as well just try it. I was pretty interested Bc every commercial said “watch for free” and I just wanted to try it out to see how “free” it really was. I had also gotten it Bc I wanted to watch a new show that was based on a book I had read in high school. I started the series and absolutely loved it but then got on to watch episode 3 expecting it to be free, but it wasn’t.  I’m reallyy disappointed Bc it was a really good show. I just think that if you say “watch for free” I expect it to be for free."
2020-07-15 04:48:45,Missing and incomplete seasons,2,kbowdown,False,I really wanted to like this service. I had been waiting for this service since it was announced. My biggest complaint is that they don’t have all the seasons of SNL. They start from season 23 and even than they are just the best of not even full seasons. They did the same with Law and Order. They started from season 8. Who in their right mind wants to start in the middle of the series. I will say though the most positive takeaway for me is that they do have Law and Order:CI which is awesome. NBC and Peacock needs to fix these issues.
2020-09-19 16:35:59,Consistently Bad,1,krillinhazuki,False,"Can’t join streams from the beginning. No spoiler-avoiding features. Categorization of content is virtually nonexistent— you just have to hope you can browse successfully via their featured interface at the time needed. No way to easily see schedules for leagues. Search literally just doesn’t do anything.

All the problems from the NBC Sports App and now you have the privilege of paying $5/mo (with ads!) for it. Fantastic. So glad this terrible app is the only way to watch the sports I want. Broadcast the games on a normal channel so the proper tech companies like Google can do your job for you, please."
2020-08-13 22:26:30,Sound and scrubbing need help.,3,Djffjcirifidjcnnc,False,Sound is always way too loud or way to soft going into a commercial and coming out of it. Either the show is too loud when the add is over or the add is way too loud. Happens every time on Apple TV. Idk about other devices. And they need to fix the forward and reverse controls for Apple TV remote. There’s no going back or forth 10 seconds like they have on all other app and trying to just scrub back and forth is terrible. Just make it like Netflix.
2020-07-17 00:11:26,chromecast won’t connect,1,ndaniel,False,"One star review to report a bug. Chromecast fails to connect on iOS so I can’t watch any content with my family on our tv. It says it’s connected in the app, but the content continues to play on the phone while the tv says Peacock ready to connect. It won’t even let me disconnect from within the app. I have to force close it out. Chromecast works fine in other apps, I tested before posting this review. It’s especially frustrating since there isn’t a fire stick app yet. If the app is the only way to watch content on a larger device via chromecast, this has to be a priority."
2020-09-22 19:06:12,Great new option,3,Shoots1234,False,"Peacock tv/ app on iOS and ps4 platforms has been a great new option to watch older shows that simply are not available anywhere else for free. However, the only mention of improvement is to fix the playback and autoplay functions. Every time I fast forward or rewind on an episode or movie it always seems to get stuck and not play. (This is not a connectivity issue) I eventually give up and go to another app. Please fix"
2020-10-15 03:22:25,Needs some serious bug fixes,1,BadReviews4You,False,"Episodes never resume where you left off, you have to select subtitles every time you use the app, it takes forever to cast to Chromecast (which has never been an issue with any other app), and, worst of all, it doesn’t autoplay the next episode while casting. 

These are all pretty basic components of literally every streaming service in 2020. It’s kind of crazy that they can get away with this all while charging $12 for no ads and full library access. Disappointed, but my hands are tied because of my need for its content!"
2020-08-03 20:12:04,Great But Still Needs Some Work,3,stevenmcbeaven,False,"The service is amazing. Love the service, the app just needs a few bugs worked out. It occasionally crashes, but other than that, my only complaints are and I really hope they add these features, the ability to add channels to a list of favorite channels that you can quickly navigate to, and an easier way to find your watchlist. You can add things to your watchlist but it’s cumbersome to actually find the watchlist itself."
2020-08-16 03:41:54,Major buffering,2,Fairman ann,False,"My family and I got peacock to watch a few specific shows that they took from other streaming services, and the one we started watching is great, love the content. However, we can’t get through a 45 minute episode in less than 75 minutes due to constant buffering and loading. Needless to say there’s a ton of bug fixing that needs to be updated and done so viewers like my family and I, can enjoy watching our shows without buffering every 10 seconds and getting very angry."
2020-08-18 16:11:18,It’s brilliant!,5,LAT2i2,False,"Idk why all the negative comments. Yes, the UI is different but it’s simple. Touch each button, try it out.  You do need decent internet service, but my internet is only one grade up from basic and it works perfectly. If your having trouble with buffers or unable to watch a complete movie that your internet, not this product."
2020-09-06 06:53:21,"I like it, but they have a long way to go before it's really usable.",2,huxleysawthefuture,False,"Things that still need to be fixed include:
1- varied streaming quality from one minute to the next
2- autoplay randomly turns off
3- formatting of profile in app is wonky so not everything is visible
4- watchlist disappears and reappears randomly
5- watchlist doesn't necessarily track where you are in an episode
6- if you finish an episode, but autoplay isn't functioning, then the app will replay the same episode you just finished when you try to watch the next episode
7- the episode tray that appears beneath the minimized episode screen should automatically scroll to where you are in the series, especially since it ends up beinghe only way you can successfully navigate between episodes. Right now, you always have to start 1.1 and scroll to where you are"
2020-07-24 12:50:33,Premier League Gold Pass User Oblivion,1,Adrian S,False,"It is totally understandable that forcing a bunch of users into one app will come with challenges. I can imagine the look on the respective project manager’s face when the “idea guy/gal” announced the executives thought his/her idea to eliminate all the various content subscription services and merge them into one was “added value!” And here we are.

I cannot find any of the content I want, easily. The app does not “remember” what I like and I can’t seem to identify what I like. Each time I log in, I am flooded with content I do not want nor have ever wanted. 

And I pay actual money for the “pleasure.”"

2020-09-27 17:37:41,Not a good replacement for NBC Sports app,3,T. Bradstreet,False,"Okay, sure, you can stream premier league games and replay them just like before. But that’s where the similarities end. You can’t customize which teams you follow, view league scores, or even get notified when your favorite teams are about to play.

It’s really lacking in that regard, and that’s disappointing, considering there’s no alternative for US consumers.

Side note, no portrait mode viewer? Why not allow that and show stats below the stream?"
2020-07-15 22:09:09,Thissucks99,1,jakethesnake70,False,"Once you make an account the app is probably fine. When you need to make a password to create an account it is extremely horrible. It doesn’t tell you the password requirements, and you can’t edit what you wrote you have to delete every time so I ended up spending nearly 10 minutes trying to create a password I could both remember for this useless account and also would fit the requirements. In case you were wondering the password I went with is the title of this review. So if you’re looking for a password thissucks99 will work."
2020-09-17 01:50:51,$5 a month for shows nobody wants to watch,1,Tooyoungforzoosk,False,"Yay finally I can pay hard earned money for reruns of such steaming piles as everybody hates Chris and psych. Literally the worst tv shows in history and you’ve got the nerve to charge money. If I wanted to see reruns of Frazier, I’d hang around the lobby of a nursing home. Oh boy! EVERY Mary Kate and Ashley movie!!! Reboots of shows nobody asked for coming soon??!! 

 I basically signed up to watch ap bio season three, binged it and forgot to cancel my trial. Oops. Guess I’ll keep flipping through every few days, finding absolutely nothing of value, for the next three weeks until my cancelation is active."
2020-07-26 14:20:27,Needs a lot of work,2,Bricks Marlin,False,"Content seems like it’s there but it’s hard to get to. Lay out makes little to no sense. I have a very hard time finding the things j know I want to watch and an impossible time discovering new things. The trending page seems to serve little to no purpose and the browse section is populated with a nonsensical hodgepodge of things put in no discernible order. And the search functionality never helps. But I’m glad NBC was able to buy an Editor’s Choice award from Apple. 

Smells like Seeso all over again."
2020-09-29 01:48:47,Pathetically Useless on Apple TV,1,Fghzdgydgytdgyvuiq,False,"This is a total joke of an App. Only using because forced to to watch some EPL games. No opinion on other content. Every. Single. Time. the app hangs, has poor controls and is generally a challenge. To make it worse next time I try to open the App it either hangs or has other issues and refuses to come off last item played. I have to literally delete app, reload app, sign in again to get it to do anything. The worst app of all the hundreds I have tried on Apple TV. I am now using an illegal stream of EPL rather than out up with this rubbish."
2020-07-17 01:07:49,You have a problem...,3,Solitaryman1,False,"So I started watching with The Capture. 
I use subtitles when I watch as I have a hearing issue. The problem I’m referring to is with the subtitles. I don’t know yet if it’s a system wide problem, but the subtitles have about a 2 second lag behind the spoken word.... very, very distracting. Please look into this. There’s no way I’m going to  pay for a subscription if this is an ongoing issue. When this gets resolved I will give it the 5 stars I think it deserves."
2020-07-15 18:18:03,Terrible device to tv casting,1,doktor straeng,False,"If your plan is to watch on a device and cast to tv then be prepared to be set back a whole five minutes. roku does not support this app so all roku users, sorry but youll need a different streaming device. not compatible with playstation either so for those with a ps4 as back up to a roku, sorry. i have found the app on my xbox however. all hope is not lost. but if you dont have an xbox then idk what to say. maybe hook up your laptop to a tv via hdmi. which is a bummer. in a world of wireless, it would be a bummer to have to resort back to a hardwired connection. users beware."
2020-09-20 14:45:12,Awful app and business model,1,Ro Official,False,"This app is complete garbage.  If it’s based even remotely off the NBC Sports app how did they screw it up so badly.  I understand that this application isn’t just meant for sports fans but visually and functionally the NBC Sports app was far superior.  I only downloaded this application because of NBC’s decision stream some EPL matches on peacockup, however, it’s a complete disgrace to split content/matches between NBC Sports (which cable subscribers have to pay for) as well as then charging them again to watch content/matches on this app.  Zero stars for me (unfortunately I have to hand out one)!"
2020-09-13 03:14:33,Premier league warning,1,jcwel19,False,"Definitely not spoiler free. Games are very hard to find when looking for replays. No real sort order, terrible menu navigation. Can’t find content I want in the sea of junk I don’t want. 

Replays for the PL are supposed to be available after 9pmEST. Which I know is ambiguous on purpose but it is after 10pm and still not all games are uploaded. With 8 years of rights to the league, you think this would be seamless by now? B/R Live had the champions league for one year and they had a spoiler free mode, easy menu navigation, and very easy to find/timely replays."
2020-10-18 04:33:45,"It’s okay, I guess",3,Ploooooooooop,False,"I know that this app is pretty new and all, but it’s missing a few key features. It doesn’t support picture in picture, which is a pretty big deal, and the app itself is pretty hard to navigate. It’s kind of disappointing that they took Parks and Rec and other good shows off of Netflix to show off the new Peacock app, when there isn’t really anything to show off. I hope future updates will make up for it."
2020-10-15 14:40:00,Please add 4:3 aspect ratio,5,Bvd1022,False,"Peacock has a lot of content that predated high definition. As such, it is difficult to watch content that is originally formatted for 4:3 aspect ratio that has not been upgraded to HD because there is no way currently to enlarge the screen on the iOS iPad app to fill the screen for those shows. Please add this feature. Best of luck with the new network."
2020-09-19 18:34:15,"Inconsistent Quality, Hard to Navigate",1,MariClure,False,"To be fair, i don’t have an interest in this app beyond live sports and am being forced to use it because NBC is moving their cable coverage largely behind this second paywall.

More than other streaming apps, however, I’ve found the quality to vary massively, and I’ve noticed it’s also consistently over a minute behind the streams that social media posts from other countries are watching (based on reactions to events). Far below the quality of ESPN+ and Fox Sports as well as Hulu/Netflix type apps. Really frustrated and disappointed."
2020-09-19 14:06:33,Sorry EPL fans - You’re screwed,1,ninjasplicer,True,"So if you want to watch certain EPL matches you have to purchase the premium version of this garbage app. It doesn’t cast to smart TVs, it can barely stream HD content consistently via the latest generation Apple TV. What project manager signed off on this app going live when it is clearly not ready?? Unfortunately, if you’re looking for other options for specific matches there aren’t any....welcome to EPL Peacock hell. Note: The best work around for Apple TV users is to download the app to your Apple TV and play from there...still buggy but better than nothing at all"
2020-08-18 17:01:52,Another App increasing lack of security,1,Grimis 4 you,False,"I was beyond excited for this app to arrive.  I pay for premium cable and I expected to be able to log in to this app to use that experience.  This app requires a separate log-in & password.  One more item that can be hacked and exploited when there isn’t a need.  Yes, I understand the shared experience across platforms concept, but if I choose not to exploit myself and the data NBC wants on me, when I already pay a premium to my provider...then why should I create an account. FOX tried this, then allowed for no log-in... why can’t Comcast?"
2020-07-23 23:24:27,The ads mess up everything,1,Aaron LRJ,False,"Great content. However, the ads mess up everything. First, when you leave the app and come back it (even for a minute) it makes you watch an ad again. Two, the ads are just the same ones repeating over and over (which doesn’t help the company because it makes me associate their brand with an annoyance. Lastly, it used to be one ad per episode and now that I updated the app today, it’s three per episode. To which I must remind you, are the same ads over and over. Such as; Target, Suburu, Magnum Ice Crea, etc. really annoying..."
2020-07-25 01:50:26,Clumsy UI choices and Gotcha Tactics,2,gib00,False,"First, the weird UI. Signing in to your Comcast account for the mid tier is not intuitive. The resume, settings, and other common account options are buried in odd places. However the WORST UI flaw is the white app swipe bar never leaves and the video playing back doesn’t scale fully to the height of the phone. 

Second, you’re going to be bombarded with ads. The first day, a show will have 1-2 ads. The next few days, 4-5. After about a week, every ad break is used with 2-3. Ugh."
2020-08-15 00:44:03,Expansive library for free,5,Asafsfaasfsafhafs,False,"I have Xfinity Internet and get Peacock for free and for that I really cannot complain. I am using the Peacock app on Apple TV and in comparison to other reviews, I actually like the interface and have not had some of the issues other reviewers experienced. Peacock provides a substantial library under the free edition for Xfinity users. Very happy so far!"
2020-08-05 16:44:09,Not quite there,3,KelseyThackston,False,"When it’s time for commercials the app will freeze and need a restart. The menu bar when you’re watching something isn’t efficient... when you try to fast forward, if you aren’t careful you may accidentally select “more episodes”, which is frustrating. Peacock, please enable the ability to click 10 seconds forward/back, and clean up the menu bar during playback."
2020-09-26 21:06:06,Peacock is a waste.,2,LFF- Liverpool Fan Forever,False,"I paid for Peacock Premium to see Premier League games, but they barely play any. Sure, I’m happy since they play a lot of Liverpool games, but they don’t play all of them. Also, I would like more games generally, not only Liverpool. I watch Premier League every morning for excitement, only to find out their are no games I can watch from Peacock at that time or at that day. If there is, it’s likely I can’t watch it because I am busy at that time. The only up is that they stream more Liverpool games."
2020-07-23 04:58:55,Great streaming service but needs work,3,Jocelyn Esc.,False,"I love using Peacock but it’s extremely glitchy, it needs lots of work and it glitches out often especially on the online website. The closed captions also need work as well. Sometimes the closed captioning will freeze but display more. Other than these few glitches i highly recommend using this streaming service. I look forward to what the future holds for Peacock."
2020-07-18 03:32:14,Layout needs work,3,Chahim,False,"I’m trying to figure out the point of the page that the app opens to? I think, though of course your want to be original, it would be helpful to have some kind of layout similar to other streaming apps. That would help the majority of people who do (pay for) other apps to navigate yours.

Bonus points for putting ads at the beginning of what I’m watching though, so that they don’t interrupt. I do appreciate that!"
2020-07-31 16:59:17,No binge options?,2,runforestttt,False,"I have the option to cast to my TV which is nice bc my smart TV doesn’t have the app, however I need to use my phone to select a new episode every single time the one I’m watching ends, it doesn’t just immediately play through the series and proceed with the next episode. Also, the interruption of the ads throws off the syncing of the audio with the video and by the end of the episode the audio is like 2 whole seconds ahead of the video and it looks like it’s dubbed."
2020-09-13 15:41:22,Terrible execution driven by a executive who doesn’t understand the digital space,1,evovbtj,False,"The app itself is bad, they try to push “live tv” down your throat, but why do live tv when you can stream on your the me?  This defeats the purpose.

It doesn’t support roku, or Samsung tv... which is where I stream from....

Also, as a English premier league can’t, instead of streaming all games available like they used to for $100/year nbc sports gold, they now stream some games under peacock and some games under nbc sport... great idea to make things more difficult to consuming...."
2020-08-16 14:15:11,ADA non-compliant!,1,Botanique,False,"Deaf already excluded from much in the hearing world. COVID-19 mandates of social distancing, especially masks block the “lip-reading” that most hearing people expect Deaf to do, being misinformed or out of masked benevolence.
Frustrating is the ruling that CC’s be provided on Audio-visual media, with loopholes. I hope it is not a loophole, but there are no CC available or being displayed, and there is nothing in settings for them either. Could there also be descriptive technology coded into the app for visually-challenged/blind, though I sight is fine, I think of the Deaf-blind/Blind-Deaf and the immense isolation and exclusion they may face every day."
2020-07-15 14:03:58,Ok bit no local channel support.,3,Titch-Neil,False,"While I like the live view section there seem to be a minor irritation and one larger one. The small one is, that as an NBC Nightly News consumer, the “on demand” section didn’t make clear by day/time, which is the latest version recorded and how old it is (series number and episode number are irrelevant to me). The larger one is that for $5 I can’t even local NBC channel and got the local news! That’s pretty basic guys."
2020-07-15 08:54:17,Doesn’t support overseas military,1,DSeltzer,False,"Sadly, this app apparently doesn’t support U.S. military and government civilians and their families stationed overseas. It would have been great to view NBC/Peacock’s content and get a piece of home (that’s different from that provided via the Armed Forces Radio and Television Service). I’ll keep the app for my occasional visits to the States, but I’m disappointed the developers didn’t think about the tens of thousands of Americans stationed overseas - 50,000+ here just in the Kaiserslautern (Germany) Military Community. Maybe someone will figure out APO/FPO/DPO mailing addresses can be used to verify American eligibility for Peacock content."
2020-07-18 19:10:33,Good content,5,Eraezer1963,False,Good quality movies. About 3 mins of ads play at the beginning of movie with no interruptions during movie. Reminds me of the old day movie theater. I hope they continue this format. I won’t tolerate ads in the middle of movie even for free. It’s a nice alternative for when those paid streaming service are lacking new content.
2020-09-23 04:21:41,Happy IOS 14 customer,5,burgoslocal78,False,"Not a single complaint in IOS14. Thanks. All i need you to work on is in an update for sony PS4 and appleTV with the captions. The subtitles font xolor is white and it need to be an option to have a black background option. Once a white background, you cant read anything and also please add more Spanish lenguaje or Spanish caption. Thanks"
2020-09-13 15:58:00,Horrible,1,keviep!,False,I hate this app I pay for cable and it won’t let me watch the game on the Cable I pay for because they want to force me to download this app that only seems to work on my cell phone and is not compatible with any of my Samsung TV’s that we’re purchased In 2020 or through the App Store from my cable provider. 0/10 would not recommend. It would be nice as an option between cable and the app but to not broadcast the game on your cable channel in order to force me to download and watch from the app seems like a predatory practice.
2020-09-09 03:32:07,"I love it, but you’re Tech Team needs to work the kinks out...",4,Amandajo8305,False,"My brother loved it and recommended it to me.

I really enjoy the content, although there seems to be an issue with AppleTv. I cannot rewind, if I pause it to scroll back, it sometimes glitches out and starts a WHOLE movie over. I want to enjoy this, and I’ll still keep watching... but there are some kinks ya’ll need to work out 😘"
2020-08-18 07:05:08,The Librivox of streaming,4,Isidiekdufof,False,"If you are downloading this app because you dont want to pay for Netflix I would tell you that although free Netflix has a far better catalog of movies and tv. However you have to pay for Netflix. Some of the highlight of the app are reservoir dogs, et, parks and rec and psycho however I have not fully explored the app though. I would recommend getting the app"
2020-08-04 16:50:37,No help,1,snj12,False,"I downloaded this app on the iPhone 11 (a compatible device) and when I went to join it said there’s a problem and it will not let me join. When I try to contact anyone for help all I can get is an automated chat telling me to email them but to email I have to log in! Somewhere in the mix up it’s telling me I have an account so I tried to sign in only for it to say “that email doesn’t match their records” and to join, but then I’m back to square one where it tells me there’s a problem when I try to join and to try later!"
2020-07-26 14:30:57,Live channels lineup and no NBCsN,1,Ysannd,False,"Good concept trying to get on the streaming demand... lots of work to develop. Not very user friendly. Also channels lineup is so irrelevant, an option for an individual preferences would be great. i,e,. If I’m only interested in sports I should be able to watch live sports. I paid for the premium content I guess there is no difference than the free version, other than no commercials 

For sports you only get to watch highlights no live matches 

NBCsN channel is not available to watch any given day only some very random channels with outdated content"
2020-07-21 20:38:46,Not ready,1,SirRoke,False,"I tire of these releases of “alpha” apps that barely work using frustrated customers as testing guinea pigs.
Tried searching for a movie. It displayed the search results half under the header. I managed to pull it down enough to select it, but it was a hassle. Then clicked on “Watch” only to be told it doesn’t play on my iPad (up to date). On Apple TV, the app will play the movie BUT no FF or Rewind! And when paused and restarted later, started at the beginning! Total waste of time. Don’t bother with this app until they’ve had another year of development."
2020-07-15 22:39:52,Good content but app itself needs work,1,DKS57,False,"Had trouble logging into the app from Apple TV even though it worked fine on the web. Discovered that support is minimal. Figured out that I had to manually type in the login info. Apple’s auto fill just messed it up. The controls are wonky too. Couldn’t fast forward or go backwards. Just didn’t work. For me this app is just not ready. On the plus side great content. 

Part2: After using it a bit longer, I downgraded to 1 star. The controls are just wonky. This app is half-baked. Not ready for prime time"
2020-09-13 16:11:04,Sub par service,2,busch did 911,False,"I’m writing this ill review because I downloaded this app to watch a soccer game. The game kept kicking me out. Checked my WiFi on one of those upload/download speed websites and it was running fine. Then used other streaming services like espn+ to check to see if it was still just my internet but those apps ran fine. Idk man, if you have another way of watching a game I would go with that and stay away from this app after my experience. Good luck to you."
2020-08-14 00:44:20,Commercials Appear Mid-Sentence,2,LoraJ0126,False,"When watching original content, the commercials occur right in the middle of the dialog instead of at the indicated locations. So suddenly a conversation is cut short and later there will be a short blank space where the commercial naturally should have occurred. 

Haven’t noticed this with old tv shows being streamed but with two original content shows on two different platforms the commercials show up in the obviously wrong places."
2020-07-15 18:46:01,No full screen on 11 Pro and lots of ads,2,InvinciShan,False,"I’m glad I didn’t pay for the service as the app stayed in 2010. It doesn’t go full screen on my 11 Pro. Would look better if I used an iPhone 6s but what’s the point of having a bigger screen iPhone if you can’t use the extra screen estate.

The free version is TERRIBLE. It kept playing ads for what felt like an eternity and the movie hasn’t even started yet. And that’s on top of it not going full screen on newer iPhones. When are you gonna learn?"
2020-07-28 03:25:56,Streaming does not resume at the right spot after the commercials,1,Elizabeth Ag,False,"I am losing my mind. I am not able to watch a full movie or episode. Once commercials starts, I pray for the streaming to resume at the right spot. Every time the content starts from the beginning or from previous commercials. When I move the slider to the right place, the commercials start again immediately, and they kick me back to the content I already watched. I can’t believe nobody has the same issue. It happens consistently for me with 3 different iOS devices."
2020-07-16 01:32:38,Good app but  some shows from the old sprout channel I think should be put in the kids area,4,Lapis lazuli 437,False,"I was thinking, in the peacock kids area, the channel can put shows from the old sprout channel there the same with the other kids shows.  You know, shows including the good night show, the Chica show, Astro blast, Barney, Nina’s world and many more of these shows from the old sprout channel."
2020-09-05 17:38:52,Pretty buggy,2,syme1012,False,Bought this exclusively for law and order.  It’s very buggy.  Won’t connect for chrome cast til after three or more times.  Drops all the time.  Subtitles don’t work half the time either but will randomly pop up.  Also No auto play which is infuriating on casting.   Also I’m here to stream. I’m not hear to watch your live stuff.  Put the stuff I’ve been watching and recommendations up front.  Not the trending.  Will probably drop this stuff nice I catch up with svu
2020-07-15 18:10:31,Really really bad,1,Josephthedope,False,"I don’t want to have this app, but NBC has forced it on me by moving all Premier League to Peacock without bothering to make apps for roku or even a working one for my computer (like... why can’t I use a second monitor and watch?). This app might work for streaming shows, but for live sports it’s horrible. No pause in full screen, no way to rewind or save my place, search doesn’t work, consistent freezing... absolute trash. I can’t understand how a company as big as NBC created such a bad product. Please please please keep the NBC Sports app for sports, it’s less bad."
2020-07-15 14:38:11,Great App!,5,knowsclassic,False,"I love this app! Content, i.e., original programming are of excellent quality. User interface is well organized, and so much to choose from. I’m liking this so far. I will update after about a month after fully embracing Peacock. Oh, I did take advantage of the of the special, so I have premium for a year. More to come!"
2020-10-01 23:11:13,Slow interface,1,12345asdfqwerty,False,"The interface on this app is incredibly slow. It takes a while to get each new page to load, which is really frustrating. Additionally, you can’t ever view your watchlist, so you have to search for the show you want to watch every time you open the app. And because the interface is slow, it takes a long time to get to the show you want to watch.

The video player also doesn’t permit you to use picture in picture mode, which is irritating"
2020-09-20 16:45:27,A painful exercise,1,Peter Dawoud,False,"So, I wake up to watch an EPL game on TV, only to find that it’s streaming on Peacock instead of NBCSN... so I figure I would attempt to give it a go only to be blocked from setting up an account without any remedy insight. 

So not only is the app unusable until I can setup an account, I discover that I also have to pay on top of my current subscription for NBCSN. 

Come on Fam, this isn’t worth all this trouble. Would rather just watch for you to post the highlights online for free than jump through painful hoops just to pay you more."
2020-09-19 14:18:56,What’s the point NBC,1,Keithjs1111,False,"I used to wake up on Saturday morning, turn on my TV, and watch Premier league. It was nice and easy, I typed in the channel and it showed up on my very large TV. But not anymore. Now I have to sign up for the stupid app, register and hope to remember my password, then I find a game and suddenly I have to have a “premium “subscription to watch. And then I have to watch on a 10 inch iPad. This is not progress. I’m not going to pay NBC for a cable channel, plus an app, in order to watch the same content I used to watch on my TV. Do better."
2020-08-02 15:07:27,Worst of the streaming platforms,2,RisXch,False,"It honestly is really annoying how underdeveloped this is
Constant issues with casting to a Vizio TV everything from the show randomly stopping and the “ready to cast” screen reappearing, to ads breaking the entire stream, to the baffling fact that casted shows don’t auto play to the next episode and this last point is mainly baffling since if you’re watching within the mobile app the shows DO auto play 
The search function in the app is strange as it has no back button
You have to force the keyboard to disappear before you can return to other portions of the app
The strange lack of other profiles although that could just be greed 
Literally only have this app for Psych and after I’m done rewatching it and watch the new movies I’m done with this app"
2020-09-05 02:30:40,Pretty good... but some shortcomings,3,Patrick in Eastie,False,"There’s a lot of great content here. The linear channels are perfect background entertainment. The app is thoughtfully designed and easy to navigate.

Sadly, Peacock’s Apple TV app doesn’t play well with AirPlay. You can only turn it on from Control Center, and you won’t be able to control volume from the Apple TV remote.

The video player is a proprietary design that doesn’t offer standard Apple TV features like the “10 seconds back/forward” gesture on the Siri remote or the captions button on the Apple TV Remote app.

The app also doesn’t make use of Apple TV’s Top Shelf feature, so it doesn’t reside in my top row of apps. If they put their Channels up there (like Pluto does), I’d put Peacock in the top spot on my Apple TV home screen."
2020-07-15 19:51:39,Fix Please,2,mulodicflux,False,"- Lightning connector to HDMI just shows black screen on TV. I wired connection to my TV should ALWAYS work... my phone is my only source of streaming.
- Searching via search bar needs work. I had to scroll and scroll to find my game.
Example: i search Tottenham, who has a live game currently playing.. and no results. I type ‘premiere’, as in the premiere league, as in arguably one of the biggest leagues in soccer, and get: no results.

Cater to your soccer fans. That was a grueling first day trying to watch live games."
2020-07-19 20:22:52,"It’s OK, but...",3,CCSbusiness,False,"It definitely needs an update. Some suggestions are:

1) Airdrop support, because it’s not downloadable on my Samsung Smart TV yet.
2) Alphabetizing ability; so you can see the list of movies / TV shows in order
3) See All feature from the beginning; “See All Movies”, “See All Shows”, etc...needs to be next to, or at the top of, its category, so we can easily scroll through all of that category.
4) Home button on every page, so we don’t have to constantly press the back button to get back to the home screen
5) “Free” section; make it easy for those who just want to enjoy the free perks of the app. Tip: look at VUDU’s format.

That’s all I could think of at the moment. If I think of anything else, I will update this review."
2020-10-07 01:32:08,"Commercials, expensive, not intuitive",2,Drumrchik,False,I downloaded this to continue watching Parks and Rec. The commercials are excessive; like REALLY excessive. The next episode won’t play unless you manually select it and it takes you all the way back to the top of the season so you have to find the episode you stopped on. I would upgrade to ditch the ads but it’s $10 a month which seems pretty high for this service. There’s potential but I don’t expect to see it.
2020-08-23 18:54:03,Awful,2,kyle simon!,False,"Binged all the Brave New World episodes for free. This is the absolute worst streaming service I’ve ever experienced. Episodes kept buffering each time an ad came on or sometimes in the middle of a scene and then I would have to restart the shows. The quality of the streaming was terrible too. Often fuzzy and unwatchable. If this is the quality of Peacock’s streaming service for free, why would I ever bother to pay for it? Only reason I gave 2 stars was because I like the story and actors."
2020-08-07 05:25:59,"Cant watch the show, only commercials",1,clweather,False,"Trying to cast the app onto my tv, the connection stops almost every time I would get to commercials. Then when I tried to reconnect, I had to start from the beginning of the show. I tried to skip ahead to where I finished and had to watch a zillion commercials and then it would not let me get any further. It kept repeating and taking me to past clips I had seen. I could never see the whole show.  It wasnt just my phone. The exact same thing happened with my husband."
2020-07-22 12:59:50,App crashes when trying to select episodes,1,abwuqphebd,False,"While the content of this app is promising, it is extremely annoying when I attempt to watch a show and click “episodes” tab to select which season/episode I want to watch, only to have it crash back to my device home screen.  This happens with multiple shows on the Peacock app across multiple devices (phone, tablet, TV, etc.). This needs to be fixed ASAP as it is a hallmark feature of any good streaming app, but one that is currently lacking in yours."

The app isn’t available on my Samsung tv, and it will not cast from any device (and we can cast other apps to the tv no problem). I’ve tried for an hour, and then started reading some of the reviews and realized I wasn’t the only one having issues. I hope they get these bugs worked out, would really like to view the content...get Gus “Silly pants” Jackson on the case!"
2020-07-19 16:15:14,Poor UI control design,2,a_skeptic,False,"When viewing a series info screen, tapping anywhere (picture OR description text) causes episode to start playing. Makes it difficult to scroll as you have to touch and hold before sliding finger. If you lift finger too soon like in a fast swipe it starts playing episode. 

In browse screen while exploring content to add to watchlist, rudely started playing commercial with no means to stop or mute the sound. Blaring out for everyone around me to hear."
2020-10-05 02:05:40,Not as good as a VCR,1,jujublaster,False,"Subscribed only to watch (English Premier League) sports. You cannot Pause, Rewind, during live games. VCRs and Betamaxes had more functionality. There is no option, in case you join a game late, to Start from Beginning if the game, or show (supposing it applies to all programming) already is airing. In the case of EPL games, they do not become available until a few hours later to watch. I don’t know how long, but not within a 1-2 hour window. And the Search function is limited. Please bring this app up to 2020, if not 2015."
2020-09-24 19:48:42,Worth the 4.99,5,MollyMuffyn08,False,"I like the idea of watching the older classic tv shows, tv was more family friendly years ago and this network has many of the good shows, I would like to see more shows like Simon and Simon, Perry Mason, Spenser For Hire, Rip Tide, Donna Reed and shows like that added to their library. So far no complaints"
2020-09-18 15:59:55,Not the right move for soccer,1,Tall Geey,False,"NBC Sports was constantly preaching how proud they were to provide a means for Americans to be able to watch soccer and to continue to expanding the game to a market where the audience is lacking. With Peacock, they take away this opportunity and crush many people’s passion for watching soccer bright and early in the weekends. I do sincerely hope his isn’t a long term approach because I will not be paying for yet another strain service. I’ll find other means of streaming the games that don’t include me digging further down into my pockets."
2020-09-02 01:25:49,Not Good,1,Mindgames30,False,"Not a good app it is included in a Cable subscription for 4.99 let me set up
and now after a week it will not let me sign in and Comcast it’s charging me on my bill says account not found email and password does not exist going back to my other paid apps that are better and just having on certain devices makes A really bad inconvenience for people acting like all they use the phone for us to watch movies and TV shows will call Comcast and have it removed and never use this app again.."
2020-07-31 20:16:08,I paid thinking I would get more...,2,ShailaLo220,False,I was so excited when this streaming platform was announced thinking I would have access to shows and seasons I don’t have access to on other streaming platforms. I immediately selected one of the the pay options assuming I would “unlock” the other shows and seasons and I am so disappointed that the seasons and shows are still so limited. I do plan on canceling and removing the app because it seems pointless.
2020-10-01 20:23:28,I only got this app for a tv show,5,this game is so fun i love it,False,"I only got this app for my favorite show Parks and Recreation and it is only showing here so that’s why I downloaded it. I really hope that you can remove the adds though. And it says that every thing is free but you have to pay for certain shows and movies. 
SO DON’T BE FOOLED ITS NOT ALL FREE!"
2020-10-03 06:32:44,No option to turn off autoplay,2,Av M,False,"I turn on a show before bed every night which helps me sleep. It used to be on Netflix and I would be happy to pay for peacock after it moved except there is no way to turn off autoplay. If there was an option to play one episode only, I would happily pay for the ad free version, but since it auto plays with no way to turn it off I will be resorting to other ways to access this show"
2020-09-05 22:20:54,So many errors,2,CT14379964,False,"Compared to other streaming apps, the casting and streaming ability is horrendous. Cast will shut down at seemingly random times, the stream takes an unusual long time to load, the app is a memory hog and is slow to react to commands, won’t stay connected to the cast if you need to make changes, and once an episode finishes it doesn’t automatically proceed to the next one.

Don’t waste your time and money until this is a smoother experience."
2020-09-20 14:36:51,So poorly designed!,1,Eltano1955,False,"The developer that designed this app lacks the ability to picture what the user wants. More over, there are mistakes such as the timing of a live event. For instance, a premier league game that is scheduled for later on is shown as started 30 min ago.  Coming events and the time of broadcasting are hard to find, and I keep going on and on with other issues. The lack of organization of the is stunning. Sad I have to pay for this to watch soccer. I fully understand why some people stream games illegally."
2020-09-14 02:29:26,All the worst parts of a TV service,1,jeffreviewingappa,False,"NBC has rolled all of the worst parts of TV into this app. It’s hard to find specific programs, everything is divided into curated channels I don’t want to watch, and they assume you will tune into their feeds. I can’t find the Premier league matches I want to watch, replays are impossible to use, and I’m not interested in over 95% of the programs they are trying to push on me. There is no way I’m watching anything here, including the soccer I’d have paid for if NBC didn’t destroy their Premier League Gold service."
2020-08-02 08:28:11,No selection. No speed. Too pricey. Look below...,1,Rage Sogers,False,"—From the people who stole The Office and Parks and Recreation off of Netflix— 

They have only a couple of shows and a very short list of movies. You get nothing with it, and if you don’t want ads, pay $9.99/month. On top of it, the service is extremely slow and isn’t compatible with Chromecast or other softwares of the such.

***Tell them no. Comcast, NBC, MSNBC, CNBC, Universal Studios, USA Network, and Xfinity are all one company and hold a monopoly on the media and entertainment***

They don’t deserve to have their own slow entertainment service on top of everything to steal two shows that everyone loves. They already pay little to nothing in tax dollars and are a menace to our economy. They’re just trying to milk you for cash with a small selection of TV shows—it isn’t worth your dollar and it’s a scam."
2020-07-16 13:50:17,Very Disappointed,1,EasyElmo,False,"I had been looking forward to this service, every since it was announced, I even subscribed in advanced, as a big fan of The Blacklist, I was disappointed to see that not only did they not have seasons 1-6, they only have the last 4 episodes from season 7.  I understand this on the free NBC app, but for the life of me I can’t understand it on a subscription service that owns its own content. Had I know this in advance I would not have subscribed, and if it doesn’t improve I will most definitely will not renew."
2020-07-15 23:12:20,Great content but needs a few patches,3,Cslate10,False,"I downloaded the app for the live soccer games, but when using a Chromecast to display to your TV, it will stop casting to your TV about every 15 minutes which is very frustrating. It also runs the live game delayed by 4 minutes instead of real time. I’m excited when this gets patched up along with several other issues others have mentioned."
2020-10-16 02:25:11,Not bad really,4,cmpuga,False,"Despite all these bad reviews, it’s actually not that bad. Maybe things got fixed with the update, and while it is a little slow, it’s not unbearable. I don’t even mind the ads, it has a pretty good selection choice especially for Halloween coming up. Although one downside add the ability to connect to a smart TVs please!!!"
2020-10-04 15:26:40,Awful Platform for Sports - NBC Sports App is a much better experience,1,obaidbwoHelpweozmzw,False,"The login process is unnecessarily complicated and error prone for users with access to premium through their cable provider. 

The streaming itself lacks basic features customers expect from a paid streaming service (no ability to fast forward/ pause during a game). Not worth the money for new customers. For xfinity customers, this just introduced another annoying hurdle to watch games on an inferior platform."
2020-09-19 12:42:39,Poor app - worst thing to happen to EPL.,1,Hxj44,False,"It took days to sign up due to a problem with the app. I finally got in and the design is not good. There is no easy way to see what is upcoming - only what’s next on a particular channel. Specifically, I don’t know what EPL games will be on later in the day. Plus, it appears I need to pay $4.99/month to watch any Premier League.  I already have cable and like 3 other streaming services. C’mon now. Also, Comcast/NBC/Universal still have beef with Roku so I can’t even watch on my TV even if I do pay for it."
2020-08-01 19:12:45,Just paid premium,2,j_hdeezy,False,I literally just paid a premium and nothing will play more than just a few seconds before going back to the ‘watch now’ page. Example: on my Lg tv peacock app(which was already installed) I clicked on ‘watch now’ and the screen changes to a small circle turning then it’ll go back to the previous page. Doesn’t actually play the video. Please don’t make me wish I hadn’t subscribed to this service. Please fix today!
2020-08-14 01:49:39,"Good start, still some potential",4,arminheewa,False,"The UI is clean
The three tabs channels, trending, and browse are simple. 
Quick feedback
Browse is like your typical streaming service catalog, nothing new here
Trending has highlights/features, good in theory but I don’t think I’ve used this tab once
And channels is actually awesome and innovative!
24/7 programming w different genres 
I would say it’s a no brained to add a law and order channel, as well as movies channel. 
I think we are underestimating the demand for just opening up the app and jumping into whatever is on at the time. 
With the fairly deep catalog, peacock can offer the best of what cable was - and merge it with the best of what streaming is now."
2020-08-06 22:10:48,Good and bad,4,Whomp657,False,"The content is great, and the ads are pretty short, even for a free account. My longest ad so far was 90 seconds at at the beginning of a movie, and the rest was ad free. Interacting with the app on an Apple TV is pretty annoying so -1 Star for that. The remote lags. I don’t have any problem with other apps, but this one I do. I upgraded to the $5/mo. one purely for Premier League access."
2020-08-03 22:30:11,Can’t turn off auto play on Apple TV,2,Lotsoflovegirl,False,"Come on it’s 2020 it’s clear NBC is trying to show investors that they are streaming many hours of content by not allowing a setting to stop Autoplay like every other streaming service offers. 

Also the Apple TV version doesn’t allow jump forward to work w Apple TVA remote as it does w all other services. 

I like them showing live tv and trending. But these other user interface issues are just common sense"
2020-07-23 20:57:00,"Good content, crappy video player",3,orced,False,The video is framed strangely in landscape mode on an iPhone 11. The video is shifted up so that the white bar at the bottom has room and the white bar never goes away. That is very distracting and annoying. Apple’s player fills the whole screen with the video and the white bar fades out with the rest of the controls after a couple seconds. This is how it should be.
2020-07-21 00:49:00,Still needs more content.,4,Ultrajbat,False,"So far everything is good, but I hope peacock tv adds more live network channels and more tv shows. Because compared to other streaming services this has a small selection of content. I hope peacock you are listening to your supporters so you can thrive. Just add more network channels and tv shows please."
2020-07-18 05:05:11,I’d give it zero stars if I could,1,Nazcahari,False,"Horrible, awful app. Bad lagging, and 145 second long commercials. It won’t work at all with chromecast 1gen from ios. 

They make you watch tons of commercials, then the screen is blank. You go to trouble shoot and it restarts again forcing you to watch more commercials. Why can’t it work with first gen chromecast. I’m not buying a new one so I can watch this junky app that never properly buffers. I’ve never had a problem with my chromecast and shouldn’t have to upgrade it to watch this awful app."
2020-07-17 22:01:15,Needs a lot of work,1,costasatucf,False,"Day 1: signed up for peacock service mostly for the EPL streaming service. However, the app freezes frequently. One has to exit from the streaming program, open something else, then return back to the streaming. This is extremely annoying. 

The selection of programs is just ok. Not great. Just the bare minimal. 

Overall, it will be hard to compete with other streaming services at this level of quality.  

Day 3: I cannot access today’s EPL games. They do not show up in the live stream options.  Either there is a bug in the program or NBCUniversal lies that all live sports events (which the studio is allowed to broadcast in the TV programs) are available through PeacockTV.  It does not matter what the answer is; from my point of view is unacceptable.

I will definitely cancel my subscription."
2020-10-17 21:17:37,Not too bad,3,nebdikebshd,False,"Haven’t been using it too long but it does have some wired aspects to it. It doesn’t continue playing shows so having to go back through and find the correct episode to play is a bit of a hassle, but as far as being able to watch tv for free I don’t feel I can complain too much. My hope is that it’ll only improve in time."
2020-08-11 03:37:52,I’d recommend this to anyone!,4,MisguidedTurd03,False,"Great app for a great streaming service at a great price. Was surprised at the quantity and quality of shows on here including some of my favorites like Psych, Monk, etc. Would recommend this to anybody. However only giving 4 stars since there are a few shows on here that don’t have the full series (even with premium)."
2020-08-06 05:39:53,Deliberately prevents screen mirroring to tv,1,myexperienc,False,"I was going to sign up for their ad-free plan at $10, but glad I tested the app first. The app deliberately black screens if you connect an hdmi cable to screen cast from iPhone to your tv. First it plays the ads perfectly so they can get their revenue, then when your program starts, it goes audio only with a black screen. Really self defeating move on their part, because I consume all my streaming as iPhone-hdmi-tv, and I’m not going to watch an app that has to be viewed on the phone."
2020-10-20 20:11:04,Horrible user experience on Apple TV OS 14,2,OpaZinn,False,"First, apple tv has standard interfaces for selecting language and subtitle options. It is next to impossible to change these settings while using the Peacock App on Apple Tv

Second, any time a show is paused the App locks up. The only way to resume from pause is to reboot the Apple TV device, select the Peacock app, select the episode you were watching, then fast forward to the point you were at previously."
2020-07-31 15:36:50,"A good service, but awful app",4,NachoFan!!!,False,"This is a great service with great content, the app however is awful!  It is very buggy and does not function great. If I’m watching a show, and then close the app to do something else, and then go back to the show, I’m back at the beginning, not where I left off. The content is great, but the app needs some work"
2020-07-25 22:39:19,Needs a lot of work...,3,Sabotatia,False,"I have the $4.99 version and the app constantly hangs up going into a commercial and coming out of it.  So irritating!  Also, you need to have an independent icon for “my list” or “watchlist” whichever fits best.  I had to google where to find my watchlist on Peacock because it is that difficult to find.  I will update my review when you get these things fixed. Get to work!"
2020-07-25 03:12:18,No HDMI support?,1,Savedblake,False,"I use my phone and computer for streaming media at home, using the HDMI connections for our TV. Tried watching our first show: plays in my phone but the TV screen only displays the place/rewind symbols. Awesome, really going to enjoy using this app while feeding my newborn walking around the house...yeah.

Peacock won’t be receiving my business without being able to play on my devices with support for connecting to my TV...like pretty much every other streaming service available right now. Highly disappointed."
2020-07-15 20:55:42,Great app but with some bugs,4,D. Hengst,False,"Saw an ad about Peacock and gave it a try, it’s a great platform with tons of classic shows and movies. The app itself however could use some improvements, a “continue watching” section, better search results, etc. Overall would recommend, I expect some bug fixes to come in the future."
2020-07-15 02:13:28,Mixed Happiness,4,Sugareviews,False,This app is easy to navigate and has a wide variety of movies and shows to watch. I would recommend this to other people that want to take their shows anywhere without using a sketchy website. One thing I don’t necessarily like is that it starts the episode over when you leave the app and come back.
2020-09-20 14:34:20,Holding Premier League hostage,1,"Get it right, NBC",False,"App has horrible startup issues. Most of the time the app will not load. And if you’re lucky enough to have it load, the app is clunky and a challenge to navigate. I attempt to use app on several different devices and various wifi locations all with same result. 
NBC Sports Gold had some issues regarding Premier League but Peacock TV and Premier League is a nightmare. Please stop forcing us to use an inferior app to watch PL matches. I’ll pay the ransom $$ for you to release PL content back to the various NBC Sports channels!"
2020-09-13 15:56:24,Aleast ESPN has Bundesliga and Serie A,1,MarkoGooz,False,Kind of a throw back to the mid90s when I was a kid and had to beg my father to order RAI. Only one tv in the house would get it and every month you had to call the cable company to reinstate it. This app has successfully turned me into a much bigger Bundesliga and Serie A fan. I would say this is the worst soccer app on the market but (even though it’s overpriced and you have to buy a new tv or streaming device for it to work) BEIN sport still takes the cake on that. So peacocktv... the second worst sports app I’ve ever seen.
2020-09-12 20:05:43,Come on nbc,1,auntie-kay,False,Love how I can watch seasons of George Lopez now on my tv. However it doesn’t auto play. So every time an episode ends. I have to physically go in a press the next show.  I guess u can say “lazy” however all the other streaming shows can do it and when u have ur children watching curious George so you get some cleaning done. It’s annoying to go back and fourth in to the room to play the next episode every 20 mins.  On top of that takes a while to stream so I don’t think I’m the only one having these issues
2020-08-30 05:23:15,Terrible support,1,François830,False,"Since launch I’ve been using Airplay to watch shows on my Apple TV, and this last update broke that functionality. Now it will only cast audio. I tried reaching out to their support but I just got jive about AirPlay NOT being supported. They intentionally broke it and refused to do anything about it. Terrible support and customer service! On top of that they won’t release it on Roku so your options are very limited for watching on anything but your phone. Good luck if you take a chance on this!"
2020-08-23 12:18:21,Lacks features we’ve come to expect of other streaming platforms,1,NK_CLE,False,"- Cannot airplay to other devices after iOS screen locks. (And there’s no app for samsung TV) 
- the video doesn’t take advantage of the entire screen, so you’re watching video on a small portion of an already small phone or iPad screen. 
- picking up where you left off on a particular show is a challenge (but improved from earlier versions). 
- recommendations engine is, I assume, non-existent. 
- content is weak, bait and switch on “free.”"
2020-08-13 04:11:28,"Mediocre, willing to see",3,"Yulian,knownasYog",False,"Title says it all. It is fair for what I use it for, and would be willing to pay for using. Main problem and drawback for me is whenever I use the app to continue watching, the app either restarts me to the very beginning of the season rather than which other season I left off, or begins the exact moment I stopped, even if it’s the last minute of the credits."
2020-08-02 22:32:56,Paid tier shouldn’t have commercials - no seasons 1-12 of Law and Order,2,J0HNBLAZE,False,"No paid tier should have commercials and this paid tier has way too many commercials. I can’t believe there are this many commercials for a tier I’m paying for.

Also, where are seasons 1-12 of Law and Order???

Seasons 1-12 of Law and Order are missing (even after all the press said the service would have Law and Order). Baffling. I signed up for one show...and it’s missing most of it."
2020-10-19 01:25:48,Great app,5,Mellvinnyy,False,I’ve been using peacock for about a week now and the app is great. I can’t relate to any of the bad reviews what so ever. So far the app is as stable if not more stable than Netflix. I was looking for ways I can watch Harry Potter without paying for every movie and this was a life saver! 10/10
2020-10-04 07:26:29,Doesn’t work,1,zombiedude80,False,"Have tried multiple times since this app became available and it’s never worked on any device including a brand new iPhone SE 2020, iPad & Mac. Also doesn’t work on any of my fiancé’s devices either. Won’t even let us create an account. You would think a company as large as nbcuniversal would have the bugs worked out by now. This will be another one of those apps that I’ll just simply forget exists and enjoy one of their competitors that know what they are doing."
2020-08-15 22:34:06,Should work better with Apple TV (4th gen HD) remote,3,trivmh,False,"I bought a year’s subscription (no commercials) when it was discounted and am happy with content. But no quick backup or fast forward by edge-pressing remote, no ability to turn on/off subtitles with three quick clicks of the menu button. Fingers crossed this will be addressed in the future. No streaming issues, though, on tv, iPhone or iPad."
2020-10-06 06:13:18,Needs some work,3,ThatRyGuy5,False,"It’s gotten pretty annoying that episodes start in the middle of the episode instead of the beginning as well as then I pause an episode then come basic to watch it later, it starts at the beginning of the episode instead of we’re I left off and occasionally will play a previous episode instead."
2020-09-28 19:36:01,Poor interphase and connection,4,Gyolchyan,False,The only reason why i am paying for this service is because the EPL decided to screw us out of NBC. First time paying for a video streaming app that doesnt allow me to pause or adjust the quality of the video. What is the point of watching a game if I am going to miss goals. Make some changes Peacock
2020-09-27 18:32:16,Horrific user & security experience,1,EduAppRater,False,"As an expert in web security, it appears that you have someone using best practices from 7-10 years ago that does not allow the use of copy and paste for password creation or 1Password autofill. Forcing someone to use a keyboard is terrible security practice (I’ll bet someone at the Helpdesk suggested this to prevent calls). The entire sign up process looks like it was someone’s high school web project. Not one person would pass my college class if they submitted this tripe. Do better."
2020-09-14 18:52:10,Don’t waste your time,1,C l a y t o n C,False,"NBC needs to get off of the pay to watch things grind. This is ridiculous, the fact that I have to switch apps and possibly have to PAY to watch premier league soccer weekly. Premier league up until last year, and every year before that, has been free to watch. Now you’re taking games away from TV and just making us pay to watch free things. Premier league soccer is the only reason NBC even has my business, wish fox had gotten it instead of you all."
2020-08-06 20:33:44,Needs to be Optimized,2,Roztz,False,"When you’re watching a video on the iPhone, you can see the home bar on the bottom of the video, the video doesn’t reach the bottom of the display because of the home bar, & you can’t even expand the video to cover the whole display, which you can do on every single other streaming service. This one needs a lot of work & optimization. It feels like a very unfinished product."
2020-07-26 00:50:45,The app that could not deliver content!,3,jermx,False,"I first heard about the app and got it installed as soon as possible. I was excited to start watching all the Chicago fire, med and pd shows.   Opened up the app and only the last seasons were on the app.   We paid thinking the rest would show up! Nope! Going to cancel that as soon as possible. If you don’t even stream your own shows what is the point."
2020-10-09 01:46:28,App sabotages any attempt to view on unapproved TVs,1,FauxProd,False,"This app is horrible. It refuses to allow you to watch anything on a Samsung TV.

Try to connect to the TV’s built in chromecast? The app will exclude your TV from the connectable devices list.

Try to watch through AirPlay despite the janky aspect ratio? It will work fine until the moment a video starts at which point the entire screen will go black to prevent their shows from being mirrored on your TV

I can’t imagine this wasn’t coded in purposefully. Does NBC have it out for Samsung? Did they demand Samsung pay them for the privilege of a basic app function? Did Samsung refuse?

Whatever the reason, I only downloaded this app because it’s the only place you can stream Harry Potter. If they won’t let me watch it on my TV then this app is a garbage waste of memory on my iPad"
2020-10-05 00:24:44,premier league,4,jeanmate,False,I only signed up to watch premier league games. It works fine but the policy of not showing games which were not originally on Peacock until 9:30 PM is annoying and baffling. What possible reason could there be for not showing a rerun of a league game for 6 to 12 hours?  ESPN+ shows reruns shortly after game end.
2020-08-27 04:12:24,Always loading,2,Raaychuull,False,"Please, get it together. I feel like this app could be great, if only it loaded better and could connect to other devices to stream. It’s not my internet, because other apps are working perfectly. It always stops to load, then never continues unless I close out, then start again. Cannot connect to TV to stream; It will continue sound, but stop video until inevitably crashing."
2020-07-17 04:26:13,Could work but doesn’t work,1,Curlyheadedtot,False,"Logged in no problem and browsed a bit from my phone. Then l tried to log on with my computer to watch something and it wouldn’t recognize my email and password. Then I logged out on my phone to see if maybe it was just not happy with two devises on one account, it didn’t work and I couldn’t log back in with either phone or computer. Tried to reset my password and still haven’t received an email to do so. Canceling subscription"
2020-07-16 22:55:56,Can only stream on app,1,Tj&Aj,False,"I would pay for a better package, but if I can only stream on a device and not to the TV, then forget that... I’ll take my money elsewhere... You can’t even use a cable from the phone to hdmi... it has no problem putting their adds on the TV when mirroring, but as far as content, it will not work... I pay for streaming services to watch as a family, but keeping it to a hand held device, you’re removing the group activity and making it for personal use"
2020-10-07 02:32:26,Terrible,1,002929x,False,"Poor functionality, no ability to set favorite shows for ease of use, no automatic turn off so episodes just play forever, no personal settings for account preferences, and worst of all it doesn’t remember what episode you left off at so if you want to resume playing your series you’re always back at S1E1 and need to remember where you were. 

How does a company with so much money and who put tons of marketing out for this release such a poor first product ..."
2020-09-21 20:43:36,Disgraceful,1,rmccormick27,False,thanks to the creation of peacock i can’t even watch premier league soccer unless i’m on my laptop or phone. yea you know that $1k+ samsung smart tv you have? well there's no peacock app on it so these degenerates have effectively taken premier league soccer off of my television even despite me paying for the service. unbelievably disappointed in nbc for this absolute money grab service that was created and forced upon us without being ready to accommodate the most basic viewing options like idk a tv?
2020-09-17 21:40:32,Less than one star!,1,BrandonVickers,False,"I would have given this TV service, or so called, less than one star IF AT ALL POSSIBLE! I have tried to download on Roku, obviously not available if you remotely try to find online, as well as, on my Samsung Smart TV. I have found NO WAY to throw the picture from my phone or computer to any other device, thus not allowing me to watch on any decent device! This television service, which has now seemed to hijack the US Open is completely ridiculous and obviously GREEDY!! DO NOT GET!!!!"
2020-09-10 16:05:25,Terrible app functionality and content,1,max.ferreira,False,"The app functionality is garbage. How did anyone at NBC green light this for roll out?! Those individuals should be terminated. The search function can’t find things like Rachel Maddow. Can’t find things like meet the press. 
Also I have the premium version of peacock and I can’t watch whole episodes of Rachel Maddow just 2 minute clips. What garbage is that?! I’ve got a free trial of this app but I can’t see paying for this garbage functionality and availability past the free trial."
2020-09-02 05:23:00,Decent App,3,Shepsffscf,False,"I like that I can watch some of my favorite TV shows on here, but the movie selection is terrible. Also, at the beginning of the TV show it said that I would only get one ad, but I got like 5 minutes worth of ads throughout the whole episode. So after everything being said, I would say this app is worth the try, but it isn’t perfect."
2020-07-28 03:57:54,Love the selection,2,bmbruml,False,"Completely love that this service has a free option and that it has a huge selection. I hate though how difficult to navigate it can be, it doesn’t remember or have a space for currently watching and that in a middle of a season it becomes premium and requires payment to continue watching. It’s definitely a work in progress with good things but a lot of improvement to be made."
2020-07-16 12:10:06,Needs MSNBC and ROKU app,2,The only HP,False,"Looks somewhat promising.  Not a big fan of clips, however.  I’d rather have the entire episode available (I.e., Rachel Maddow).  ALSO, the clips have no date information so I couldn’t tell when they originally aired.  Until dates are added I won’t watch anything that’s provided in “clip” format.  MSNBC should be a channel option to watch live.

However, until the app is available on ROKU I won’t won’t watch at all.  I stream everything through ROKU."
2020-07-21 03:13:46,"Officially boycotting, but not voluntarily",1,Hargggg,False,"So we got peacock specifically to watch psych 2 and I was very surprised by the free library! It’s super nice! And I get that not everything is free. I honestly don’t mind that, it’s a business.

The 1 star review is simply because it’s nearly impossible to watch anything. No Apple TV app, no roku app, and no smart tv app. It only supports Comcast TV’s. So simply put I need to buy another smart tv to watch something with my family. Tried to screen mirror but it said that wasn’t supported (After streaming three minutes of Ads straight to my TV) 

Hdmi cable, said it wasn’t supported (After supporting another 3 minutes of ads) 

I would love to 5 star this because of the free library, but I can’t watch any of it with my family. So it’s a one star until Peacock can decide what it wants to be."
2020-07-21 01:09:09,Underrated app!,5,Kazey_miller12334,False,"This app is so underrated. Its just hulu(with the having a premium to get more shows)but with one segment of commercials expanding from 30-60 seconds. Everyone feels the need to bash on the “extra paying” and the ONE commercial break but atleast the majority of it is free and its only top 60 seconds of your tome wasted per ep. 
UNDERRATED APP!"
2020-07-20 18:21:56,Not HDMI compatible!,1,Ktp8,False,"I have never written one of these reviews before but this is just outrageous!  Not only is Peacock not available on Roku or FireTV, it is NOT HDMI compatible!  So I have to watch on my ipad and cannot stream to my TV! This is the STUPIDEST decision for a streaming service EVER! Just about EVERYONE uses HDMI cords to connect devices!  I cannot believe they are purposely trying to force people to purchase their “compatible” devices!  I have never, ever seen such irresponsible decision-making in my life! I refuse to purchase a new TV or new streaming device. 😡🤬"
2020-07-26 02:08:43,Back button goes way too far back sometimes,2,DOS486,False,The back button says go back 10 seconds sometimes when I push it it takes me back the whole episode looks like your developers have a lot more work to do. Also re-making me watch commercials because it take me back that far is really shady that would make me not pay for the service because that’s just terrible development.
2020-07-15 19:15:33,Awesome app,5,Elconejoguero,False,Amazing app! I’ve tried other live stream tv apps and the quality is usually awful and there’s always some lagging but I didn’t have any issues with the live tv with this app. They also have a great selection of movies and tv shows. Will use this often 👍🏻
2020-07-15 05:56:58,"Excited to get started, but...",4,ryanamcl,False,"Very excited for this new service! I know it’s the night before launch, but I’ve already notice a couple nit picky things: 
1. No profiles? Even HBO Max caved in with these. Now you’re the only service that doesn’t have them. It’s manageable obviously but it seems odd. Hopefully that’ll happen sometime soon. 
2. I know it’s a coming feature, but I’m disappointed that offline viewing isn’t an option on launch. 
3. On my payment plan it says that I’m paying $100/ MONTH when I’m on an annual plan? I know this must be a glitch but I hope it’s not true! 

Excited to dive in to all those SVU seasons!"
2020-10-17 18:53:22,Xfinity’s On-Demand,1,vinylbond,False,"This service feels just like Xfinity’s on-demand service (plus Premier League), nothing more. Originals are extremely weak, content is just meh. I don’t see myself paying a dime for this. 

Really Comcast, what’s your goal here? Rivaling Netflix, or just dip your toe into the water? Feels like the latter.

Oh by the way, we should be able to watch at least full screen. Not only there are two huge black bars on the side, even the bottom of the picture is black. It’s like a quarter of the screen is empty."
2020-10-02 02:20:07,Wonderful for watching our favorite shows!,5,YGlen,False,We are presently enjoying the complete series Everybody Loves Raymond and look forward to many other shows in the lineup.  What a great selection of shows - and they all play with minimal commercials.  Thank you Peacock!
2020-09-29 14:08:39,Shouldn’t have to pay money,1,timfaust,False,"I think it is absolutely ridiculous that you want people to pay extra to stream live sports when everyone else is streaming them for free. Not only are you making people pay, you also have removed the games from cable so you can’t even watch the game in your own house. You are making people pay for cable and have to pay again to watch something they enjoy. This is absolutely ridiculous."
2020-09-14 22:49:18,absolutely horrible,1,Gusvdm,False,"to my dismay, some of the best games of the English Premier league are now ONLY on peacock!
So i get their free app and find out that i can watch the games, but ONLY live. I cant watch a game that has already ended. I cant even watch the game from the beginning. 
OK , tell myself, this must be how they draw you in. So, desperate for the game, i sign up and pay for peacock PREMIER!  
So i think i'm set to watch the Chelsea game today. At three pm i briefly check in for 1minute and, YEAH, there's the game, but i still cant rewind and watch from the beginning. GRRRR

Now tonight i log in and... Can't find the game ANYWHERE!!  I tried everything. Browse, search, channels, ... nothing!  It's just not there!  So what the heck did i pay for?   

HORRIBLE service, Horribly confusing, awkward, interface, both for the app and the browser."
2020-08-31 16:51:30,Cox User,4,Ags118,False,"Peacock solved my issue. I created a Peacock account on my Cox cable box, but I cannot seem to login to the Peacock app on my iPhone or iPad. When I try to create an account so that they are linked with the email, then I got an error message. Can someone please help? I cannot find anything on the Internet or the Peacock help page to resolve the issue."
2020-08-17 01:12:30,Must’ve changed a lot,5,Sheesh are,False,"I see a lot of reviews saying it buffers, but it works completely fine for me. Now, I don’t use it for on-the-TV, but on my phone and computer and it runs great. It has amazing shows with what I would consider minimal ads, all for free"
2020-07-19 04:36:26,Great Content. Bad App.,2,MaggieFitz107,False,"We paid for the premium package and it’s been a complete nightmare. I’ve never tried so hard to watch TV. Really disappointing. 
App won’t load. Or it drops the connection. Sometimes it requires restarting the device. We’ve tried using it on two iPhones (X and 11) and two iPads, as well as two different generations of Chromecast. Same results regardless. 
I hope the fix is in development otherwise we just wasted money."
2020-10-18 03:41:54,Update,2,LadyinZephyrhills,False,"I have this installed on my fire tv in fact both fir TVs.  The app was working fine.  All of a sudden I’m getting the message to update, which I tried and then I get the error message that the app to update cannot be found.

I started to get used to watching this app but now I’m getting nothing but problems.  I’ve done everything on my end so now I going to cancel.  I certainly wished that could be corrected."
2020-07-17 14:14:39,Privacy policy is a concern,3,Jenna grace5,False,"The privacy policy is at least honest about what they do and I am thankful for that as many apps will do it in secret and not warn the customer. However it seems that the app collects a bit too much info, if you compare what the app collects compared to a spyware app... it leaves little difference. It is too bad because I saw some shows that I wanted to watch on it but too invasive."
2020-07-15 16:10:45,I love it,5,multixellee,False,The only thing is I hope they will be adding more seasons to some of the shows like Songland and I hope they had all the voice seasons because I wanna rewatch all the seasons of the voice with out having to use a sketchy website overall it’s an amazing app
2020-10-20 02:02:39,I like it,4,Ksnndkx,False,Not sure where all these bad reviews are coming from. I’ve had an easy time using the app and I’ve been able to watch some shows and movies for free that I can’t find elsewhere. I’m leaving one star off because I wish this app would offer Picture in Picture on iOS.
2020-09-20 12:12:06,Just what we need when people are losing jobs another pay stream app!!!!!,1,nitefly22,False,"This is ridiculous to all of a sudden spring up a streaming app during a pandemic where people have been losing there jobs and since of income, I guess that’s when greed really kicks in. They had nbcsports which would stream sports for free, but that wasn’t good enough they needed more money so now I gotta pay another 6$ a month because I wanna watch premier league. There’s a special place in hell for people like you NBC."
2020-09-05 15:49:43,Glitchy,2,dispatcheyr,False,"I downloaded this to watch the Dale Earnhardt Jr. show on abandoned speedways. Sadly I can only watch it on my iPhone X. The app constantly crashes on my iPad. With no Roku app it stinks to have to watch it on my iPhone. And no, I’m not getting an Apple TV or any other device to watch this channel. In this day and age when every network has a streaming service, it amazes me that this one is so horrible. Two stars because it does work well on my iPhone."
2020-09-19 19:15:05,Paying for premium but can’t access it,1,annacarsen,False,"Very frustrating experience !  I upgraded to premium plus on my iPad and it works fine .  I try to watch from my phone or my Apple TV and it insists I upgrade to premium again ,  then tells me I have premium and that’s where I am stuck !  This should never have made it past QA.  Oh and provide a way to get help instead of asking users to wade through your FAQs and still not find the answer.  Unacceptable and a collosal waste of my time !"
2020-08-12 02:34:35,Will the father of the 6 year old that wrote this app please stand up?,1,nickname455346776432679,False,"And take his PC away.

Horrible.  Shame on you Comcast.  Guess just another F*&k up...

Developers that worked on this app, will have difficulties being a cashier at WM.  Just plain bad.  Content is a scam.  You can watch the current season of Yellowstone on the Paramount app.  On beandick?  No!!!  Subtitles are supposed to be 5 seconds late right?  So you can guess what they are saying!  4K?  HDR what??  Dolby Visi what??.  Atmos means you can hear stuff, right???  Paid for a year...  Shame on me..."
2020-07-22 15:58:43,FOX NEWS please,4,Skyinbluewater,False,Very happy with the service and no price attached! I was able to log in and get a well designed guide that I could follow right away. The format is designed well and the visual is clear and bright. Appreciate the no charge service. If you carried FOX NEWS I would be willing to pay a very modest amount for a subscription to Peacock.
2020-07-21 06:49:25,Extremely disappointed,1,Billiebog,False,"I have already paid over $80 for a year of commercial free NBC programming through the Peacock TV app. I am very disappointed. 

The app is NOT available on my smart TV or my TiVo.I am using the app on my iPad, but have found a number of issues. 

MSNBC series, such as the new Reidout program are not available in their entirety. There are a string of clips available, but I cannot find the series. 

Blacklist has only the last five episodes available.

I find the app menus and search very limited, disorganized and find it very difficult to locate programming. 

It is not possible to set up individuals so that programming recommendations can be customized.

I have just scratched the surface, and given that I paid upfront for a year to get the discount, I hope there is a 2nd release coming soon!!"
2020-07-15 07:40:49,Its almost good,3,jtibayan,False,The interface is super cool and simple but its not smooth its super laggy and when i touch one show it delays to show me the informations and its really confusing because when i touch the seasons it doesnt give me episodes and even when i touch the “free episodes” the episodes doesnt show up . I know that you guys just launched but can you guys fix this delay and lag? Thank you.
2020-10-05 02:06:11,Major work need to be done on this app,1,bostonbobo,False,"Really NBC?? Really?? This is how you join streaming?? By creating a horrible app that doesn’t allow anything to load, sometimes content doesn’t come up, buffering is horrible, casting feature works horribly. This is not 2008, but this app makes it feel like that. You have a lot infrastructure to build to make this app worth using. I really hope you paying customers dont have the same quality of service"
2020-09-12 19:38:02,Premium content but poor user experience,2,zach rehm,False,"Downloaded and purchased Premium ($4.99/month) to watch Premier League. Live streaming is glitchy and it appears there is no option to record. Unclear how quickly On Demand is available following a match and how long it stays available (maybe 24 hours?) I have no problem paying for premium content, but improvements are needed to the infrastructure."
2020-08-05 07:33:18,Disappointed,1,Defrtgh,False,Only reason why I downloaded the app is to watch Psych the movie. But saw there were many more things I can watch. I was so excited until I tried to airplay it onto my tv. Everything else on my phone or iPad I can airplay to my Samsung TV except Peacock. Plays first few seconds and that’s it. I can hear the show but there’s no picture. And no it’s not my TV because every other app I have seems to airplay just fine. Such a disappointing app :( hope they fix it soon.
2020-07-25 02:31:29,Cannot stream to television,1,Otis_burg,False,"This app does not support streaming to Apple TV or Chromecast. I also cannot connect an HDMI adapter to my phone or computer and mirror the displays. It will play the commercials just fine, but when the actual show or movie begins to play, it only plays on the device and won’t display on the TV. I wasted an hour trying to get this to either stream from my phone or mirroring displays via AirPlay connected directly to an HDMI cable. Does NBC want people to actually watch use this app?"
2020-07-17 18:28:10,Found my Netflix replacement!,5,Tictacmintz4,False,"Better interface, better content, flexible and  affordable subscription options, and unique-to-streaming features (channels, trending content, live sports/news)! Couldn’t have asked for a better addition to my streaming roster!"
2020-07-17 00:36:34,Please fix this,4,Miguel2233,False,I can’t play this from my iPad connected to my tv with an hdmi cable. I love the selection but I can’t watch on my tv. It played the ads perfectly then when the movie began - total dark. I tried on two different movies neither worked. Just dark with sound. Please fix in an update. Thank you!
2020-10-16 04:10:38,NBC shame,1,Manns41078,False,"Protesting your decision to air Trump town hall at the same time as Biden already had his scheduled. Shame. I’m cancelling and will have to think seriously if I want to support such behavior in an entertainment provider. 

As for the app it is a bit clunky. Starting a stream often is super slow and switching to the episode list rarely works. Content is pretty nice but I’ve only had the app a couple weeks and am running out of stuff I want to see. Nothing much new being added."
2020-09-19 16:50:31,Confusing Browse Tab and No Apple AirPlay,2,Bindner01,False,"Browse tab is confusing. It’s not easy to find a show or game that you want. Having NBC, NBCSN, and this app makes user experience a mess. If the intend is to make users pay more for various services, then at least give them an option to centralize those services. Switching back and for between devices and platforms doesn’t help. Also, Apple Airplay does not work. Terrible."
2020-07-27 05:45:07,Won’t connect to xfinity account,1,Cc285,False,Says xfinity customers get a free upgraded middle version. Try to link the account and it says account linked to another email. What email? I’m the first to download app and try it that way. My mom just watches from her tv and it doesn’t require a login. Why bother having xfinity users create alternative accounts???? Shouldn’t we just be able to sign in with our xfinity account?? Definitely doesn’t compete with other streaming services at all.
2020-07-16 23:28:15,Just can’t watch period!,1,Joyflute,False,"I can’t get it to mirror to my tv with my apple adapter and a HDMI cable when every other app out there works. I can watch ads but nothing else. Until you guys get this on fire stick, it’s unwatchable. Don’t put out apps that don’t work!  Also very few things are actually free, only a few movies and a couple episodes of some tv shows. Hard pass on this for now! Note to developers: no one will spend money on an app when it only partially functions."
2020-07-16 00:53:59,Will not play,1,Clmarti,False,Commercials plays without issues for the first few minutes. Movie will not play. Then I get an error not supported. Tried on computer also. Same thing great commercial quality.  Movie will not play get an error about using external displays.  So as long as you have a single display your good but running three displays only using browser on one it just will not play. Glad I stuck with the free and did not pay for this service.
2020-07-15 18:10:21,"Quick and easy, however…",4,Cool Cat1111111112222,False,"The app runs very smoothly and was super easy to get going. However, when I went to cast the premier league game on my tv from my phone, the game strangely was 5 to 6 minutes behind the game in real time and even on my phone. This was strange and I hope it gets fixed soon."
2020-07-15 15:12:25,Law and Order,3,@InfamousChild,False,"I’ve been waiting for Peacock TV for a few months excited to be able to watch Michael Moriarty in Law and Order. Tell you what, when you include ALL the seasons of Law and Order, I’ll pay for your app, until then, nope.
Otherwise, it’s a very nice streaming app. Watching on my iPad. I’ll give you three stars as I’m disappointed about missing seasons in shows offered."
2020-10-10 01:00:47,Great service over all,5,keithtravis,False,Only thing I can see is when I watch it on my phone the video isn’t full screen. It’s like the screen is up a little from the bottom instead of filling up my screen.
2020-08-26 21:29:36,Waited for this app ! But not good enough to add to monthly bills just yet,2,calamity jai,False,Just began trial & sadly will not be able to continue after it ends.  The tv shows run one at a time & having to go into the phone & app for every single episode is a bit annoying. But I’m sure it’s been noticed & changes will come. For now I will wait btwn 3-6 months after updates & improvements occur. Then likely become a lifelong customer
2020-09-15 01:49:00,Yesterday’s news literally,1,dhowbdv,False,"Ok I like to watch the news,  but it only has the Nightly New from yesterday or later.  Who the heck watches yesterday’s news.  Good thing you can look through the entire catalog of shows on the app in about five minutes.  You can make a fast decision around keeping the app for more than a week. With all the shows NBC has programmed over the years I’m a little underwhelmed.  If they don’t up there game in a few weeks,  I’m on to the next app."
2020-08-28 14:07:56,No to peacock,1,"Slot, slot fish",False,"I thought this app would be okay because they advertise a large selection of tv. Well it takes forever to get something to play and it keeps shutting down which is very aggravating. Also after each episode you have to go back into the app and search what you were watching and maybe it will play, maybe not. Too aggravating to continue to watch. I’m glad I did not pay after the 30 day trial. Not worth the time."
2020-07-15 18:58:20,Slow,2,Polkalot,False,"So far the app interface is not that great. I have the highest internet speed but the app is slow and frequently freezes. Maybe it is because it is new and a number of people are trying to use it. Only wanted it since they took premier league of the sports channel which is annoying. Also, on Apple TV the screensaver will come on while watching tv in this app... so maybe fix that too."
2020-07-27 02:29:38,Can’t watch an entire episode,1,try again Peacock,False,"After ever commercial break the episode would double back to a part I already watched. Had to give up and revert back to a different streaming service. I wanted to give it the benefit of the doubt and give it an honest effort, but I couldn’t even get through a single episode. To bring more context, I was Air Playing the content from my iPhone. I did try to Air Play from my Mac and that didn’t work either. Kept getting an error that way."
2020-07-15 20:01:21,Underwhelmed,2,iDon76,False,"I was hoping it would be more like the cbs app with the ability to watch live local programming so I could cut other streaming services but unfortunately that is not the case and IMO that was a failure on NBC to not have that but I suppose when they own Comcast that’s what happens so they don’t lose Comcast customers. The programming seems pretty lackluster thus fafor such a huge build up, you get more programming on the original NBC app."
2020-07-15 17:27:32,Watch live without subscription lol,5,Naz513,False,This is what happens when you are a billion dollar company and hire developers without validating their background and not doing proper testing. I’m able to watch live sports just by clicking on the live channels without even paying a dime. Thanks nbc! 😊
2020-10-04 15:05:55,"PREMIER LEAGUE VIEWERS, DONT BUY",1,GabeOrt,False,"If you’re an avid viewer of premier league football and want a cheap place to watch all live games, you’d be wasting your money with this app. They market it as having all the live games with their Premium subscription but they only air one game a day. 205 of the seasons games will not be available to Premium subscribers. They don’t even choose the best game of the day, it’s like they don’t even care about the sport. Streaming the live game was always behind too. Its just a cash grab for nbc."
2020-09-13 09:25:11,"I open app, only see 6 colored dot!",1,Hugh Jass Koda,False,"I went to the Peacock website, created an account, installed app.  When I open the app, I see some colored dots bounce a couple times then the line up in a straight line and that is it!  Nothing else!  Checked device compatibility list. Says “Tablet devices iOS 11 and above”. Yet it will not run on my iPad Mini 2 on 12.4.6.  They already collected my email address.  Bet the spam they are going to send me will work every time though!"
2020-08-19 20:16:37,Not Real Happy,1,Dcarpen333,False,"I recently downloaded Peacock thinking it might be a good streaming service to add to our options. I chose the free version to check the service out before committing to any paid plan. Yesterday, I started watching a series listed as free, yet today when I went back to continue watching, the show is listed as available only with a paid plan. Poor advertising and a bad way to draw people in. Not sure I will continue with this service or not."
2020-08-06 12:22:19,Very disappointed,1,Azarry,False,"I've been hearing and hearing about Peacock on TV, and so have decided to check it out. Unfortunately, this app is not very accessible for the blind/visually impaired. I'm using this with the latest version of ios13, and with VOiceover enabled and am using a bluetooth keyboard. I am hopeful that since Netflix has improved accessibility, you all will as well. I am aware this is a pretty new app. Either way, I won't be able to check things out until accessibility is fixed."
2020-07-27 16:41:27,Off to a great start,4,Anders Sienna,False,"Different content than the other guys, gives me a break from the norm. A welcomed distraction while I’m stuck indoors. Columbo’s googly eyes sure crack me up

Now please just give me volume control during the amped out loud commercials (you know we still have volume buttons right). Thats the only sour to your sweet."
2020-07-17 04:57:48,Awesome content,5,Daniel.07.24.xxxx,False,It was first available only through the Xfinity X1 app. There is a lot of new content and I love the way it’s organized. Life is so much easier now that there’s an app so that I can take my sweet time searching the selections vs. hogging up the tv browsing endless with the X1 app.
2020-07-30 21:56:34,Nothing works,2,cgnlb,False,I have had this for two weeks now and have not been able to watch one show or movie all the way though. I have bit the iOS and OStv and both have major issues the interface on both freezes and crashes way to often uninformed many other issues. I’m they have 2 more weeks and I’m canceling. That said the library of content is amazing
2020-07-15 17:09:11,Add more tv shows like 2 broke girls and battle bots,5,nikevamp,False,There isn't enough choices the app is amazing but not enough choices on what to watch I love 2 broke girls and battle bots yet I cannot find either of the two may you please make an uodate with more choices of shows to watch
2020-08-03 16:12:59,Best new app,5,brxkenhexrt,False,I really enjoy I even think it’s better then netflix you don’t have to pay for nothing and my little brother likes it he really enjoys the shows that are there and thank you very much to the creator of this app it’s really good 5/5 rating
2020-07-18 14:37:21,Not free if you have to pay premium to watch good shows,1,pat-rice artgggg,False,"I feel like I downloaded this app for nothing. When I got the shock that I would have to pay premium to watch most of the entertaining shows. Do not be deceptive and say something is free when it is not, when I realize this I am mediately deleted the app. People don’t waste your time downloading unless you want to pay premium to watch shows. I already have enough streaming apps I pay for I don’t need another."
2020-07-16 01:25:50,Premier League Games mover to Peacock?!?!,1,ViolinBetsy,False,"I think it is unconscionable to move the Premier League games to Peacock when it is not available on all platforms- in our house, we have Roku and Samsung. I have kept my Comcast service specifically to be able to see the games. Imagine our dismay today when 2 major games were only on Peacock. I even loaded all suggested apps and paid for the Premier level and attempted to cast and only got a frozen picture on the screen. So far Peacock and NBC get a grade of F."
2020-07-15 23:42:51,Disappointment,1,semnol78,False,"Well let’s start with $10 for commercial free viewing. I start the very first episode of an original series and immediately I am forced to watch a 30 second commercial advertising Peacock that cannot be skipped... REALLY??? Commercial free is commercial free, not some what commercial free....
Then the Apple TV app is laid out very badly. Not as bad as some, but just lazy design.
Let’s hope my opinion improves as I use the service or I can see a cancellation of the premium service and a deletion of then apps."
2020-10-15 01:02:57,Peacock app doesn’t work,1,Drea_shorts,False,I register for peacock and have an account and I entered the same credentials and says my account isn’t found but does work on the website. I was only able to find the application on Apple TV but is not available on smart TV’s. You are not able to skip when your watching a show. I wish we can skip commercials and forward as an option. Another application not needed to watch my favorite shows
2020-07-30 15:12:55,Free for nothing,2,tae1926,False,I was excited to be able to watch The Profit episodes for free but it turns out I cant blow up the screen from my phone to my tv because I don't have internet. I normally use a lightning usb cable to watch movies from my phone which netflix allows but peacock doesn't. Its sad that majority of the ratings on the app are three stars. Especially when its free. Please update you features so I can revise my review.
2020-09-20 17:04:32,Put the app on Samsung tv,4,paolo mauricio,False,"The app works fine for me, but having to stream things on my phone especially premier league matches is not ideal. There’s no app on Samsung tv, and whenever I try to airplay from my phone to the tv I can only get audio and the screen is still playing on my phone."
2020-09-20 15:14:57,Limited and disappointing,1,G007C,False,"I downloaded Peacock to watch the English Premier League and have been massively disappointed. When I connect to Apple TV, the app does not stream the image. There are no re runs for me to watch at a later date nor can I pause the if I need to step away. These features are available on other streaming services where I could watch NBCSports. Overall, very dissatisfied with Peacock. Considering removing and not watching English Premier League anymore."
2020-09-01 18:46:00,Worthless for the deaf/Deaf or anyone who uses captions,1,kindones,False,This is horrible. So glad I get it free I’ve tried to watch 3 episodes of American greed. The captions on American greed don’t work. They get stuck on one sentence for over 3-5 mins at times.  I’ve even turned them off and back on to try to get them to sync and it doesn’t. Don’t waste your time trying.  My phone is also set for apps to auto play but I guess this app doesn’t sync with iPhone accessibility features.
2020-09-20 17:27:22,"No pause feature, no search capability",2,Pizazipa,False,"You can’t pause the channel while you are watching. Also, the show you are watching has no information- for example: SNL season and episode. 

Premier League games are not available right away- if you miss the start you can’t rewind to the beginning. Instead, you have to wait for the replay to become “available “."
2020-07-26 18:31:11,Missing basic settings,3,iAmLegend718,False,"Overall, the app is good but missing some basic settings such as changing the video stream quality since by default all shows stream at HD. Majority of video stream apps have the option to select SD or HD or UHD. Please add this setting to allow users the choice of quality and for those with monthly capped data usage bandwidth."
2020-07-22 18:02:35,Accessibility issues all over the place in this app,1,Texas Albatross,False,"Accessibility issues all over the place in this app. Once content starts playing in the channels tab, there is no way for a voiceover user to pause the streaming show. No way that I can seem to bring up controls for playing content i.e. start and stop. There is also no audio description setting either. If Netflix can do it and you want to be competitive then these issues need to addressed."
2020-10-06 22:30:48,Log in issues and poor customer service,1,DG1895,True,"Do not get this app unless you have the patience of a Saint. I constantly have to try log in and always says that my password is invalid. I reset the password and it still shows error. Their customer care team said it’s because my email isn’t verified, yet I know for a fact it is. They have tried 3 times now to send me an email to verify it but yet I never received it. It’s a horrible service."
2020-09-28 23:52:55,What a waste of effort,1,CH4NC3 88,False,"Well too bad for the originals it had available to watch, which I enjoyed the free episodes and they got me to purchase the service.  Now I am stuck with a screen that has the dots just sitting there.  I was only able to watch three episode once purchased.  I have restated, attempted to log in on iPad (pop up says “unable to fetch data”), etc.  

I hope the shows get picked up on another service soon....very disappointed."
2020-09-25 18:18:49,Amazing,5,Ron Redacted,False,I find this app to be of the highest quality. There are hardly and issues on it and it brings a whole new experience for viewing your shows check it out
2020-07-28 03:14:22,Needs work,2,Yolemap,False,The content looks pretty good but I’m not the kind of person that wants to watch movies or tv shows on my phone so I have an adapter and a HDMI cable to cast or mirror programs in my tv. Which is something I can do with Netflix but apparently it’s not possible with Peacock. Sorry but I don’t think I will pay to upgrade my account just to watch things on my phone so I’m probably going to just delete the app.
2020-08-21 10:29:04,Good app,4,Gigiofonly4,False,"Love the app it’s good for the price, I was looking for a particular show to watch (Yellowstone) to get caught up to current season and found it! The only draw back I have is I can only get the app on my iPhone or iPad, this app is not available on my fire stick, smart TV or Ruku. Only available on select devices"
2020-07-28 19:33:46,Some bugs with chromecast,3,CollegeGurl21,False,"Someone else mentioned the syncing gets messed up. Happens to me too. Also when trying to watch Days of Our Lives, every episode that does not have the airdate on top of the thumbnail will not go to my chromecast despite being connected. All the ones with an airdate on the thumbnail go to the chromecast fine. What an odd bug."
2020-10-17 15:15:11,Fix the buffering already!,2,roxy0679,False,I signed up before it came out and love the selection but the freakin buffering is driving me nuts! This is 2020. I watch on my Apple TV and I have super fast Internet.  No other streaming app does this. Everything I watch on this app has to be stopped and restarted. Seriously fix that crap. I’m paid for a year so if this doesn’t get fixed I’ll be canceling this streaming app.
2020-07-16 06:29:54,Absolutely LOVE!!!!!!!,5,Baby21Girlx,False,I absolutely love this APP!!!! They have great tv shows & movies for free & even better ones with a subscription! & it’s only 4.99 a month! Less than half of these other tv & movies app!! Just loveeee! Wasn’t sure what to expect when I downloaded it but I’m in love!!!!!!! Thanks Peacock TV!!!
2020-09-15 10:01:23,"Content is fine, App is mediocre",3,aabeaujean,False,"The content Peacock offers is fine. Worth the price. The app is very basic. Has to buffer a while, even on a strong WiFi signal. Content often drops with cell signal.  Also, the search feature doesn't capture all the content and takes a while to search."
2020-10-03 14:02:34,Terrible for Premier League,1,brentr19,False,"Incredibly frustrating not being able to start a live match from the beginning, or be able to rewind or fast-forward. 

You have to wait until someone uploads the complete match to the App, which often takes hours from the time the match has finished. 

This App feels like a throwback to the early 2000’s. Definitely not worth the money we are all being charged for use of the App."
2020-09-28 20:01:44,Utter Sh*tte,1,Radiolou10,False,"Im writing this review instead of watching the bloody football match like I was able to when NBCSN had the deal with Premiere League football. Now we’re stuck with this garbage that doesn’t let us watch the match even after upgrading to premium. And how much of a joke is this - after buying premium plus there’s still ads. You’ve gone mad. Fix this app or give it back to the good folks over at NBC that know how to broadcast properly, thank you!"
2020-09-20 14:01:47,Clearly needs work,1,Khan!!,False,"I’m only using this app because NBC Sports is now essentially only showing Premier League on Peacock— which is incompatible with Roku- F-brilliant— so I’m relegated to watching on the iphone. It’s the biggest league in the world for the biggest sport in the world. It’s one of the main features of your service. Searching for content, results for “premier league” — “no results were found”— someone needs to find out what the fk is going on with your search engine"
2020-09-14 10:25:01,21st Century? Peacock?,1,Mehshona,False,"2020 Update: And the new name is still old, since you don't even offer picture in picture. Good programming. Crappy App! Can't you afford to pay someone who knows how to create a competitive app? What about your parent company, Comcast? You know, the INTERNET company. Never mind. Their service is terrible too. Such a joke. 

2019: Come join us NBC! Apps are great now. Just hire someone who knows what they're doing!  Oh right, I remember... Comcast owns you... that explains everything!"
2020-09-23 11:24:12,Sports playback is riddled with bugs,2,ARaph123,False,"If NBC wants to move all EPL to this Peacock app, I am fine with that but the app needs to work. 

Quite frustrating experience this morning where the app forgot where I was in the match every time I swiped away to respond to an email or view another app. I also cannot for the life of me figure out how to fast forward. I expect that feature costs extra? Haha"
2020-09-10 23:06:23,This app is awful!!,1,fjfkfkfkd,False,It would not let me sign in for weeks and the best part it won’t let me sign in anymore I deleted this app this app is terrible!! Like what app does that and it’s not my Wi-Fi. I had to go to the website I don’t know why?? I mean yeah it’s free but it doesn’t mean it won’t to rip you off!! Even though you don’t pay for it. They just use you for reviews because they’re free!! And I would honestly want to give it 0 stars but it doesn’t work that way!
2020-09-03 00:01:55,Won’t stop freezing,1,Krista Michelle,False,"Every time I’m half way through the add, it freezes. I’ve tried several times, backing out and restarting what I was watching only for it to do it again. I’ve had peacock for 24 hours and even though it’s free, it’s not worth it in my opinion. They have a lot of issues to fix. Also, I thought peacock was supposed to Friends (could be wrong on my info), but they don’t have it which is really disappointing"
2020-09-26 16:31:35,Why do I pay for this,1,Altabird97,False,This stupid network doesn’t even show the games that are on. Didn’t show the first match of the day and I can’t find anywhere that they are showing the second game. If Chelsea is play you should show the game. America’s best player plays for them and they don’t have the game on. They should not be allowed to have broadcasting rights if they don’t show the games!!! Outrageous that they only plan to broadcast 4 games from match day 3.
2020-09-19 18:07:50,"Service is not user friendly, watchlist useless for sports",2,A reader delighted,False,"Where is the “watchlist”?
We got this to watch Premier League but you have to search every time for the games and you can’t just add the program to the watchlist except individually but there is no “watchlist” anywhere? 

Someone posted it is embedded in the Browse menu item. Hm, odd choice

The user interface seems to be circa 2005, not dynamic and user friendly

If you could add the season or program to a real watchlist and you could just go there, the app would be better. I hope the watchlist feature is added soon, otherwise what’s the point? All other services remember your choices and are more searchable"
2020-08-26 21:32:28,Not able to view entire seasons,3,SMDKMA8243,False,I like the app since it has Yellowstone but I am not happy about the fact that only season 7 of Chicago PD is available. You would think for $10 that all Seasons would be available as well as access to the shows on the NBC app as well. There are some good movies. Hopefully season 3 of Yellowstone shows up sooon
2020-08-07 00:53:43,Garbage app. Tech support is a badly designed bot.,1,jamielawrence42,False,"Trying to use this on my appletv. The app doesn’t save your watch progress. So if I pause and go to the kitchen for a few minutes, and come back and the appletv has gone to sleep, when I wake it, it restarts the episode. So I tried going to their site for support. There is Jack for articles and the chat for support, opens a badly designed bot that just walked me through the same articles that didn’t address the issue."
2020-08-06 17:29:37,Disappointed,3,JD&FD,False,You’ve Already changed the best part of your service. At launch movies would play a single long commercial break at the beginning and then no more interruptions. Now this is no longer the case and watching movies with repeated interruptions is deal breaker. Please go back to a single commercial break for movies
2020-07-16 02:26:18,Love it !,5,user143823,False,Easy to use. Signed up using the voice remote and got peacock premium downloaded it on my phone and was able to watch the same content. Easy navigation ! So excited to binge watch all the great content.
2020-07-16 01:34:36,iOS does not show video on connected TV,1,Vb2k,False,"I use a small screen, older iPhone and use a dedicated cable to view video on the TV. This service does not allow the video of the programs or movies to be passed through to the TV. It seems to be happy showing all the other functions of the app, and even the ads sometimes, but the content is not available. I cannot recommend this at all until that is fixed."
2020-07-15 13:53:58,Love this streaming service.  One of the two best.,5,finsat,False,"I binge watch a heck of lot of TV, way before COVID, and my primary source was always the streaming service with the smile from A to Z.  Now Peacock is on the same level and I love I have so MUCH more choices.  Especially Law & Order ans Law and Order Criminal Intent.  Bliss.  😊"
2020-10-17 11:49:32,"Great Content, App still lacking features",3,MKGSs,False,"The app has some great original shows. The Mehdi Hassan show is on point, but you can only add individual episodes to watch list and not entire shows. They episodes also don't have specific info in their descriptions, such as a short summary of topics covered and a list of guests."
2020-09-20 14:46:59,Embarrassingly bad,1,Hatmanup,False,"Shameful that NBC Universal requires people to watch Premier league soccer on a tiny device when their app is not compatible with most Samsung TVs and most other TVs. So if you wanna watch Chelsea versus Liverpool today, get your reading glasses out and get really close to your iPhone. In addition the feed doesn’t work well so it’s constantly low quality and blurry. I will remember this in the future when I have a choice and I will not choose NBC Universal or Peacock"
2020-09-20 08:22:35,CONcast at it again,1,gbdsyf bhb ;468855$!,False,"I shouldn’t be surprised at a piece of garbage, poor functioning app from the same company that disregards customer service with such distinction. This dud continually drops service, but to be fair maybe that may be due to the crappy cable connection provided by CONcast. Peacock disables Airplay or the ability to use a HDMI cable to broadcast to a TV. The kicker for sports fans is making customers pay twice to watch EPL. But I do have to give it to them for consistency in customer dissatisfaction."
2020-10-05 21:12:57,Constant crashes,2,appletap543,False,"I like the service but the iPhone app doesn’t work well at all. The app crashes very frequently.  As I am watching an episode, in a few minutes the app will shut down completely and when I re-open it and go back to the show, the last point where I watched is not saved. I would really like to see this fixed."
2020-09-02 14:00:10,No log in!!,1,usingmytimeup!,False,"Since September 1st cannot log in on IPad nor Apple TV, or not recognized directly through peacock tv directly. Paid, big mistake for promotion, for a year. After trying for about 24 hours the site does not know who I am. I cannot even get in to get a refund or make sure I am not charged next time around. Cannot find any info as to what the problem is either! First and last time for signing up for promotional offerings!"
2020-07-19 19:14:29,Not recommended,1,kyhillbilly62,False,My neighbor tried this and didn’t get any further than signing in and couldn’t figure out what to do so we took it off of her phone. Not clear instructions not clear directions and no where could I find a menu to get you to the actual TV programs. I was going to sign up and I don’t need any more difficulty in my life and I definitely couldn’t show her something that I couldn’t figure out myself. Needs a lot of work
2020-07-15 20:34:56,App needs work content Ok,1,Spetsu,False,"There are problems with the playback, especially their live offerings like soccer. No pause, no rewind, banner time out is way too long, and so many others. Quit having people write apps that probably never use it in the first place. There are tons of video apps to sample, and obviously someone here wanted to do it a bit different, and ultimately ended up with a worse experience overall. Content is OK, but fix the app shortcomings please"
2020-10-06 09:51:43,Peacock,5,karenvaladez222,False,"peacock is actually really good and i recommend it , it shows alot of good movies WITHOUT ANY MISSING FILMS , and i actually really enjoy using peacock. one problem about it is that there’s adds but it’s fine , but other than that I actually love peacock!!"
2020-09-20 18:03:18,Terrible App. Had to buy to watch Premier League soccer,1,ronaldo_da_rappa,False,"The app just isn’t seamless, especially for soccer. For starters it made no sense to even have to pay for this app in addition to paying for other apps to watch premier league games that aren’t on peacock. Some games are on here and some aren’t. The search function is terrible - I can’t even type premier league to find games i have to type the name of the teams paying. 

Not satisfied at all."
2020-07-28 04:10:44,Chromecast audio syncing issue,2,Alieo24,False,"The app casts fine to my Chromecast, but after a few minutes the audio and picture no longer sync up, so I constantly have to start and stop whatever I am watching. The content is not great either. I don’t think it’s worth paying for until they fix this major bug and add more shows I can’t watch on other streaming services."
2020-08-29 20:55:33,Excellent so far.  Just one question:,4,nprfan1,False,"I looked at the website and it looks like I can upgrade to premium very easily from there.  But since I signed up via the app, is there any way to upgrade within it rather than via the website?"
2020-10-02 02:37:19,Obviously not Netflix,2,Porcupineh,False,"I downloaded the app because Parks and Rec got taken off Netflix. 

The app is fine for the most part but I hate that the default loading screen isn’t to continue watching whatever I was watching. Also, there’s no way to skip credits and there’s a decent number of ads. This is somewhat understandable but then what I’m watching buffers after..."
2020-07-21 19:20:32,“You don’t meet the United States Roaming Requirements”,1,rcniman,False,"An American citizen, living overseas. The app will let me download it and set up an account and verify it before finally telling me that I don’t meet their roaming requirements. With absolutely no explanation of what those roaming requirements are. 

It’s 2020. There are more than 7 billion people in the world, most, obviously, not living in the U.S. How difficult is it to make an app at least communicate to it’s potential users who can and can’t use it?"
2020-07-20 03:52:16,Great shows,4,Noah Stine,False,I loves the shows and movies peacock provides but my only problem is that there is no good way to browse. There’s thousands of movies and shows on peacock and I only see the ones that are advertised. I wish there was a better way to browse all movies and all shows.
2020-07-16 14:47:00,Errors make it hard to watch,3,klcarr15,False,Whenever I stream any show at some point in the episode it stops and then it will go to the Ready to Cast screen. It loses the progress in the show. Another downside is the streaming gets out of synch with the picture as well in most episodes as well. Love the content just needs some tweaks!
2020-10-17 09:01:22,"Good content, app lacking",3,Mikes_tk,False,"I love the content, especially Larry Wilmore, but when I try to stream to my Apple TV,  the tv display freezes (iPhone displays fine at the same time) and the sound cuts in and out.

I don’t experience these issues with other streaming apps. 

  I’m looking forward to an improved app and more Wilmore!"
2020-10-02 03:36:27,Ads,1,Odbunny,False,It was easy watching my shows on Netflix/Amazon prime. Along comes this app which changes a simple show to include ads. I’d rather pay not to watch another ad. You don’t save the show I constantly watch on the main page which means I have to search for it each time. And I can’t minimize the screen to a pocket like with Netflix to answer a text or something. I should be upset that my show switched over to you.
2020-08-16 05:29:29,"App won’t open, good on PC",2,Eaglepenguinz,False,"So I downloaded the app today and it wouldn’t open. No colorful dogs or anything. I thought that was very curious..so I googled around a bit and found peacock people telling me to restart the phone and redownload the app. I did that a few times and still nothing. I even updated my phone from iOS 13.5 to iOS 13.6.1 and it’s still broken, but now I can see the dots sometimes. 

I have been using Peacock on my desktop, though. It has been working very nice so far. I’ve enjoyed watching A.P. Bio. and I highly recommend the show so far haha.

Anyway, hope the devs fix this bug and let me get to streaming!

2020-09-19 17:10:10,Awful Streaming Service,1,Anonymous8254,False,"If you are thinking of downloading this app in order to watch live sports or other live events Do Not Bother. Spend your time looking for a free stream online and trust me your time would have been better spent. It is unfortunate that Peacock has access to so many shows and movies and even the Premier League because it simply does not work. If you are someone who enjoys a headache download this app, otherwise steer clear."
2020-08-11 21:19:29,Not free,1,Vanessa Carlisle,False,This app is not free sure you can download it for free and maybe watch one movie but most movies that you want to watch are not free and it’ll let you watch three episodes of a show and then not let you watch the rest which is messed up you have to have premium which cost money so their commercials are lying and it is not free it’s deceiving and disgusting people with low income want to watch these movies for memories yet it says they’re free but it’s not
2020-08-08 04:45:22,They’ve got the right idea,3,nerfherder1912,False,"There are still some bugs to work out, but for the most part they have the app built. The bugs I’ve experienced so far are:

App doesn’t automatically play the next episode in a series, I have to physically enter the app and tap on the episode I want to watch next.

App doesn’t resume series when I hit “continue watching” in the main menu.

When casting to the tv, the app turns the cast screen horizontal instead of vertical like every other app. 

Other than this, no complaints. Great selection, love getting back into some old friends in terms of shows and movies."
2020-08-02 18:32:05,App constantly crashes,3,geryka,False,"The app constantly crashes. Also, it doesn’t retain accurate information about how far you’ve watched a show. You may be on season 1, episode 2, but when log in and want to continue watching from where you left off, it sends you to season 2, episode 12."
2020-10-03 03:09:32,Shame on NBC,1,dnta11,False,"NBC is ‘my channel’. Lester Holt, Today Show, Chuck Todd etc. I was excited to try Peacock. I agree with most users re tha app being horrible and the lack of being able to watch it on a TV. I am 70 years old and my eyes can not tolerate looking at an iPad for extended periods and forget even being able to see on a phone. Shame on NBC! My experience, plus reading reviews & low ratings here, steer me to know I will not buy the app service. Big mistake NBC has made."

Well, I take it back it just had live sound no picture. It Needs a major improvement . Im thinking about to cancel  after 7 days free. Now NBC is too greedy to put most games on PeaCOCK tv and they will get bad feedback from live sport fans. And I am so sad it was editors’ choice app. How much NBC paid for it???"
2020-09-17 11:29:10,"Bad Interface, Execution + Insulting to Soccer Fans",1,Penguini Power,False,"Read most any other review to see how rough the app functions. 

I can’t believe the price gouging of English Premier League fans. NBC Sports was a great place for Americans to learn the game with great coverage and sometimes as many as 6-8 games a week. Now, they’re moving their best games onto the OTT platform on Peacock. It’s sad that to enjoy premier league, you have to subscribe to cable and a bonus service. 

Once again, it’s one thing if they put some of the lower tier games on Peacock (like they did with NBC Sports Gold, which is normal for sports fans to pay extra to have access to ALL games) but the first two weeks of Premier League have had their best matches on Peacock and not on NBC Sports. 

(Apple TV app is rough too)"
2020-08-20 11:59:08,Useless if it can’t be viewed on Roku,1,Rmont8364,False,"The app for the phone is okay, though the UI leaves a lot to be desired. But I want to be able to view this on my TV. I’ve watched a few things on my phone but would really like for my wife and I to be able to view it on television. It makes it worthless to me. Stream to TV apps don’t work for our smart TV. I’ve tried free ones and paid for some only to have to get a refund. Peacock, stream to TV or go the F away."
2020-08-20 05:19:03,No HDMI support,1,Disney fan 88,False,"Very frustrating- the app will not show the programs on a TV connected via an HDMI cable.  The TV will show the app sxeeeh with program choices and will play the commercials that precede the programs with the free version. However, when the program starts the TV screen goes blank and the program is not viewable.  Why not?  Makes no sense to restrict this; it is obviously restricted via the app as the app and commercials will play while the programming will not."
2020-07-27 01:26:53,Waste of money,2,echo32gamer,False,"Unfortunately it has a crappy library of movies and shows, when you find a movie you want to see in HD 4K, it doesn’t play. It loads and loads and it stops at the main page, I tried resetting my device, checked my internet connection but wouldn’t load the Mummy movie with Brendan Fraiser, so annoying. I’m glad I canceled it during the trial. Avoid at all costs."
2020-07-18 01:30:57,garbage. zero content.,1,pugdogg,False,I wanted to give this a try so I installed it and after three minutes I ended up uninstalling it because it was total garbage. There was no content so I decided to search for a bravo TV show which you would think would be on there since they are the same owners and there were zero search results. One of the most useless apps I’ve ever encountered and I cannot believe this is from a company like Comcast
2020-10-18 14:39:47,Is NBC limiting streaming?,2,Jjordan370,False,It’s bad enough that NBC is forcing me to subscribe to Peacock to watch more than one Premier League game on Saturday and Sunday. But when I try to play the game through Apple TV it only streams the audio.  Why would I be prevented from streaming? Support site is unhelpful when looking for a fix. The UX gives no personalization options so I need to search for sporting events when I want to watch.
2020-07-16 09:41:57,Won’t cast to TV so it’s USELESS,1,Lise P.,False,"Not sure what the point is with this app if it won’t cast to my TV. I have a 75 inch TV so why would I want to watch anything on my phone unless I was stuck in a car? The “regular” NBC app casts with no problems, Peacock doesn’t even have that as an option. I’ll check back once they update the app to see if they figured out and fixed this but until you can cast to a smart TV there is no point in me wasting my time."
2020-10-20 12:57:48,So good!,5,Uhnnnnn,False,"This app is the No.1 steaming app for me. It works really well, plus it barely loads. If you are a Harry Potter fan like me, LISTEN UP! Once you make an account, you can watch EVERY SINGLE ONE of the movies FOR FREE! They are high quality, and don’t cost you a single cent. Please get! :)"
2020-10-13 11:57:44,Commercials,2,Braccez,False,"I use this to access the live tv channels, and the commercials are insanely loud. If I were to guess, the commercials are more than twice as loud as the shows. It is really annoying to have to turn it down, then back up every commercial break. I know that commercials tune up their sound on purpose, but I have never seen it this bad. Please fix."
2020-07-28 02:56:01,Mirror?,2,Water 12345,False,"I really wish the app offered a mirror to TV option. I tried through my phone and smartTV and though it looked like it was working the TV just wouldn’t show the same screen at all.
I’m not saying to be just like Netflix/Prime/Hulu, but even the TNT app allows you to mirror your screen.
PLEASE FIX THIS! 
I’m looking forward to watching the new shows :)

Update: Still not possible to watch on your TV, unless you have an Apple TV. The screen mirror I usually use with my iPhone Does. Not. Work.
I will probably wait until their next update to see if they find a solution, otherwise it’s just too frustrating, I’ll stick with my more reliable streaming platforms."
2020-10-05 22:35:36,Good,4,HarryPotterIsAwesome3455,False,Although people have been saying the quality is bad... it works perfectly fine for me! It’s a bit annoying to go back 10 seconds if you want to but I would recommend. It’s free and it’s good quality for a completely FREE movie.
2020-09-19 02:59:40,Awful,1,T.W.Y,True,"I’ve tried numerous of times to create an account and every time it tells me “An error has occurred. Try again later”. I’ve tried uninstalling it and installing it again, but same error message. Also have tried downloading the app and creating an account various days out the week and still can’t even create an account or see what’s on the app. Is their a block against apple users?"
2020-09-13 16:01:41,Can’t cast or use HDMI,1,Jcb4200,False,"All I wanted to do was watch the soccer game. I used to be able to do this from Roku with the PAID version of NBC sports app. But now they’re not streaming there but on peacock premium! The problem is you can’t airplay, you can’t mirror and worst of all you can’t even use hdmi out from your iPhone. Why the frack anyone would pay for this app under these circumstances is beyond me but this app should be avoided by all until this is fixed."
2020-08-19 14:59:11,Disappointed,1,EMTDCJ5,False,I fell for it. They said look at all we offer “FREE” and they had the show I wanted to watch. Super excited. Download app and start first episode of my show and go to move on to second episode and bam there it is. If you want to continue you must pay. So bummed. So not going to pay for all these. Deleted app was let down but my fault I didn’t look into it more. I’ll give them that there advertising was good they got me to try.
2020-10-08 20:41:23,Painful to use,2,isophena,False,This app is painful to use. If you are trying to binge a show it constantly loads for commercials and if you go back to the menu it does not save what episode you just left. I have to search for the show I’m watching and the episode every time I use it. I also find the menu setup confusing. I do like the variety of programs.
2020-07-27 16:19:00,Had High Hopes,1,Niknak831,False,"I had high hopes for this app. Used it at my MIL’s house to watch endless episodes of The King Of Queens. Since she was an Xfinity customer it worked beautifully BUT when we tried to pair the app with our Samsung Smart TV it does not work. Airplay won’t work either. I even tried going on the TV’s internet to watch and it won’t work properly. This is insane! Why make, release and, promote an app that only select people can use. Please fix this."
2020-09-19 14:32:23,More issues the longer you use,2,jmckay88,False,"Only got the app for the U.S. Open and didn’t have many issues the first two days of use. Day three and I’ve had to restart the app five times in the last hour. Drops casting, lots of buffering, etc makes it a big hassle to use. Like the idea but wish this kinks had been worked out already."
2020-10-04 12:47:38,Premium doesn’t work,1,OnlyBad123,False,"I am supposed to get premium through my xfinity plan. My peacock account shows I have premium through the xfinity account. Yet, when I go to stream anything (I only try to use this for EPL games since they are no longer on TV), it asks me to sign up for premium and won’t stream the game.

I sent their customer support an email and received a “did you turn it off and turn it back on” suggestion."
2020-07-18 01:36:24,Programming,2,DStarLoyalty,False,"So when you first launched yesterday on opening day, apparently everything was free to watch, today it is showing you must subscribe to premium to be able to be able to watch some movies ? It was false advertisement when it said it was free then, never did it was said that you must subscribe to premium to watch a certain movie.."
2020-08-26 17:47:18,This app on chrome cast,3,EchoNets,False,So far it works good. Just that it needs to start playing episodes consecutively right after the other. I hate having to cast another episode manually over and over. Can y’all fix this cause I really like some of the shows here and I’d like to watch them without interruption
2020-07-20 03:21:18,Love it,5,opaque985,False,I love this app I am in college so I like to not pay for stuff and this app is great for that it has good shows my only complaint is that you can’t do other stuff on your phone while your watching its
2020-09-16 21:00:57,Put latest episodes first,2,Maggielou88,False,"I got this app primarily to watch Seth Meyers. It’s pretty annoying to go to the show page and find the episodes in chronological order, with the first episode of the season listed first. You have to scroll through dozens and dozens of episodes to watch the latest. Why would you put the oldest first? Who wants to watch six-month-old political comedy?"
2020-07-17 15:46:26,No streaming to TV,1,TheRealDutchee,False,"App doesn’t work with my Apple TV. Displaying on tv through Airplay doesn’t work for video either, only getting audio. Hooking up the iPad directly with HDMI adapter to tv also offers a black screen with audio only. Pretty useless app. And ‘free’ means you have to sit through tons of ads constantly or spend 5 - 10 bucks a months and still get to watch ads nevertheless.

And here comes the kicker. Received an email from Peacock saying streaming is easy as ever no matter what content you want to warch. So i press the stream now button which takes me to their website. I log in and when i press a show to watch it says content not available. LOL!

This app is so lacking and broken is it hilarious.

DELETE!!!"
2020-07-16 13:19:05,Really poorly designed app,1,jeditig,False,"The app design is really horrible. First, have to scroll through a bunch of things in a particular category to get to the browse all section. Huge annoyance. Next, can add things to a watch list, but I can’t find where said watch list is. Who approved this app design and layout?   This maybe would’ve been ok if this was the first streaming service out, but you’re late to the party and brought stale chips."
2020-09-19 17:03:46,App is just okay - content is severely lacking.,1,JustinRez,False,I have a trial for Peacock. I will absolutely NOT be paying for a subscription when my trial runs out. The service is not even close to being worth the price. Comcast/NBC need to accept that they’ve fallen WAY behind the other media companies and don’t really deserve to have their own streaming service - unless it’s ~$1.99/month. Maybe people would pay that. ...But maybe not.
2020-07-16 23:38:47,Overrated,2,sunbear813,False,"This app is overrated as crap. The media made such a big show of its release and it definitely doesn’t live up to the hype that was created when announcing it. The biggest mistake is it’s content. It has no good movies, no good shows and not even good cartoons. I’m keeping it for now, as I’m hoping for them to add better stuff to it. Now I know why it was free, it’s complete garbage. Hopefully it gets a tune up."
2020-09-05 04:06:07,Fix it!!!,1,Mgc107,False,This is the buggiest streaming app I’ve ever had the misfortune to have on my phone and iPad! There’s a lot of desirable content available but it’s annoying trying to get to work. Watching a half hour show can take 45 minutes to an hour with the constant buffering and other stoppages. It’s not my devices or my internet connection. I stream a lot of content and Peacock TV is the only one with these issues.
2020-08-29 20:39:07,No Chromecast,1,JanBob654,False,"Ok sports fans here’s the deal. When the first sign in screen came on I didn’t fill in nothing, I just hit enter. Then a 2nd sign in screen came up so I entered my credentials that I created weeks ago and ‘boom’ I got in. I then hit cast to my Chromecast 1 and it took a little while (seconds) and ‘voila’ it worked. So I’m watching ‘Dracula’. A b&w movie from 1931, 10 mins in VIVID color commercials, really spoiled the mood, shut it off. How much can a 90 year old b&w movie cost?"
2020-08-23 07:02:52,Lots of errors during playback,1,SeaDour,False,"I frequently get the “Oops, something went wrong” pop up right after a bunch of ads play. Then I have to restart the video and scrub back to where I think I left off, and watch the ads all over again! And then sometimes it doesn’t play at the spot I scrubbed to, so I have to re-scrub to the right position and then watch the ads AGAIN. Ridiculous! Not worth it. Don’t bother."
2020-07-24 16:40:51,Eh. It’s okay.,3,Luppie Lupa,False,"I say it’s okay because, it does give you the free movies and tv shows, but you still have to pay for premium to watch the rest of the movies and shows, and that to me is False Advertisement (I mean, I get why you do it) but you say that it’s FREE in ALL of your ads, but you still have to pay for the rest of it. 😤"
2020-07-19 14:42:06,Refreshingly good and free,5,Tommywal,False,I was pleasantly surprised when I downloaded this free app to watch “Psych 2” it is really free. No hidden costs yet and TONS of free content. I’ve found more to watch here than on Disney Plus which I was bored with as soon as the Mandelorian was over.
2020-07-15 15:14:43,App won’t even launch,1,Jon1095,False,"Haven’t been able to successfully launch the app even once. The whole app either crashes or freezes on a black screen. I realize this was just released but making sure the app actually launches should be a priority if you’re hoping for positive feedback about all the content you’re offering. Please fix right away, this problem should not exist at launch."
2020-10-06 15:35:59,Premium won’t open after purchase,1,MickeyRenee,False,"I’ve tried three times now to purchase the premium option. Nothing happens. It’s a neverending loop going from choosing episode 2 of a series to going back to the purchase page. Then it tells me I already purchased premium and back to episodes and so forth.
I’d love to actually watch some shows on the premium option, so this is ridiculous!!"
2020-10-01 23:10:13,Thanks for making it a pain to watch P&R,1,BAMcDaniel,False,"The only reason I downloaded this was to watch parks and rec, because they took it off of Netflix to host it here. Fine. However, in ONE episode, there were 7 ads, 4 times where it froze, and the app crashed in the middle of the episode. I would pay the $9.99 for ad free, but you can’t expect people to pay you for the premium if you can’t even get it to work right."
2020-09-17 16:16:46,Great concept,5,myteb,False,"Peacock TV that’s great! It has a lot of the old shows that I like, law and order criminal intent, Colombo along with all of murder she wrote. I’ve had no problem watching the shows on my iPad and I am very thankful for the new Peacock TV streaming."
2020-07-23 02:04:03,Add casting abilities & develop an app for Samsung TV’s,3,Emly Goss,False,I downloaded the Peacock IPhone app the day it was released. Great content but I was seriously disappointed to find out that there isn’t a casting capability to broadcast to my TV wirelessly.  Please resolve this issue. Also please please please develop an app for Samsung TV’s. I noticed the app was released to every other provider except Samsung televisions.
2020-10-18 13:30:31,Pretty terrible,2,Ron Foreman,False,"App doesn’t use Apples video player so you cannot seek or skip back/forward easily. It’s worst on Apple TV because it’s fairly impossible to skip back just 10 seconds on a 3 hour sports video because the seeking is so sensitive. If it wasn’t for premier league, I would cancel my subscription because the video player is awful"
2020-07-16 02:59:39,Great job on app and outstanding content!,5,MiddleMike,False,"Kudos to developers for a user interface that blows away most of the new streaming services and doesn’t screw up the content. And the content is *really* good with old, new, and timeless classics."
2020-10-20 04:34:52,Harry Potter forever!,3,omgfrikchicken,False,"I think it’s a great app except for the only reason I downloaded it was for watching the Harry Potter movies, and they are only on till the end of October. I think it should be free all year round but with adds unless you pay to get them removed with a premium purchase. But other then that I love it!"
2020-10-14 05:01:55,Can’t Register/sign in,1,Contrari,False,"I will not be reviewing the programming or details of this service because after multiple attempts I’ve not been able to log in. Having read the other reviews, I think I got lucky. FYI, the error message tells me to “try again later.” This is the same message I get from time to time on my AT&T app, so maybe NBCU/Comcast has the same untalented app developer as AT&T. Bye, Peacock. I never knew you."
2020-09-19 19:34:34,Ruined the Premier League for everyone,1,Yonny101,False,"We already pay for cable but now we have to pay extra for the games we should already have?! This is ridiculous, also immoral because of this pandemic we are in and some people may not be able to afford it. Also, some may not have smart devices or know how to use smart devices like the elderly. You guys are greedy and inconsiderate of others."
2020-08-11 23:27:50,Bugs?,4,Countrygirl310,False,It worked great then I signed out and now it won’t let me watch the premium shows that I signed up for watched almost an entire series and now I can’t finish it. Keeps telling me to “upgrade to premium” and I already have it.
2020-09-21 22:57:57,Not IOS like,2,TheHammer610,False,"It is surprising that Apple approved this app for AppleTV.  The remote does not work like it does for other apps.  Closed captioning does not work by pulling down.  Cannot skip back or forward, nor see the timeline.
But worst is that Peacock allows one to add programs as a ‘Favorite’, but there is not a way to then see those ‘Favorites’.
I rarely use Peacock because it is so bad."
2020-10-09 12:32:44,Horrible.,1,Kookookachuiluvnemo!,False,"The app is so full of glitches that it almost makes it impossible to use. If you scroll, it freezes. If you tap a button, it freezes. If you try to pause and then play again, it freezes. I spend more time waiting for the app to cooperate than I do using it. It’s so frustrating. If this doesn’t get fixed I will definitely be canceling my subscription."
2020-09-20 15:59:13,"Solid 1.0 release, needs more features",3,haymoose,False,"Please add to the pipeline the ability to soft-double-tap (if that’s a word) to enlarge older 4:3 content to 16:9 screen on AppleTV. 

All other quality streaming apps support this.

Also, why have more titles from the NBC app not been moved over? So many titles I watch there are not on Peacock yet. Why?"
2020-08-18 14:48:42,"Fine to stream on phone, but...",2,MVTK,False,"I’ve had no issues streaming shows on my phone and it’s been a decent app in that regard. However, whenever I try to hook the phone up to the TV via HDMI cable, the audio comes up on the TV but no video. I want this app to succeed, but there certainly is more work that needs to be done before it’s a competitor in the streaming game."
2020-08-21 22:24:04,Not really free,1,Eclipse1010,False,"I was going to give two stars to seem generous but then I decided to give it one stars.

They do not have free tv shows, movies, or anything of that sort. The only thing they have free is streaming and news. This app was very very misleading. I’d recommend that you’re better off spending more time on Netflix(which by the way offers a 30 day free trial instead of a 7 day free trial).

Thanks for taking the time to read my review."
2020-08-04 19:40:59,Why the terrible custom TV UI?,2,Jef.fM,False,"There are perfectly usable player controls available on these platforms. Why try to reinvent them? I can’t ever seem to replay something I’ve missed, turn on/off captions, or easily scrub forward or backward if needed. Please remove the unusable custom controls and use the built-in player control APIs available on TV."
2020-08-05 03:19:36,Apple TV app,3,Tulwun,False,Like the content. Commercials are short. Overall not to bad at all. But...  they really need to fix the controls. The forward and back controls are all over the place. Practically not useable. Which is a real issue when you miss something and you cannot rewind.
2020-08-03 20:34:56,Needs improvement,2,stublar family,False,"It needs to improve the aspect ratio. I open a movie and it takes up less than half the screen. Also, on the iphone x the bar to slide up to get home does not disappear when watching. 

These are definitely two of the biggest problems but the developer could easily fix them."
2020-07-26 17:29:05,Long way to go,2,PaHiker,False,"Pause in the middle of a movie to watch something live, or to go out, it doesn’t remember where you left off.

Watched one movie, found another one to watch and the app locks up. This has happened a couple times now, end up having to exit the app then come back into it.

Not quite ready for prime time."
2020-10-18 12:44:38,Greed,1,sash19035,False,"This is how premier league will drop interest in USA. The premier league should sell their rights to someone else, this is pure robbery, they make us pay cable so we can watch games now they charge again monthly to watch other games, what’s next? Paying even extra for derby games on top of the premium? Terrible!!! This American corporate greed have no end. Doesn’t matter how much money they have will never be enough!"
2020-10-09 08:37:09,Impossible to watch on TV,1,Catherine Yemi,False,Tried to watch a movie but this app doesn’t seem to allow you to use Airplay. I don’t understand the point of an app that isn’t available on Smart TVs but will also not allow you to stream on it either. I’m not trying to watch a 2 hr long movie on my tiny little phone screen!! I really thought this would go without saying but I guess the NBC people need reminding...
2020-10-08 18:56:19,AMAZING,3,olandynasty,False,So for years I’ve been looking for a streaming service in which I can can watch the HP series on and this one has them all. I love that it’s only short ads in between the movie and not long ads!! I haven’t tried the channels yet but I love the movies and can’t wait to try the original content
2020-10-02 22:54:29,Terrible keyboard on Xbox,1,njb2006,False,"This is the worst keyboard design when viewing on the Xbox. You can not see where the cursor. I had to say out load which letter I was at while going left or right. So if I started on A and k was 2 moves to the left, I had to count. It took me 10 minutes just to log in. Then once your in the app it is the same thing! The designer needs to go back to the drawing board absolutely terrible!!!!!!!"
2020-09-13 03:40:01,Unbelievably Bad,1,TheSteveOfRock,False,"I know this is NBC universal so who cares about creating an app that works. I signed up for Premier League games. You’d think instead of scrolling through the channels and then the programs within the channels to stumble upon something you’re looking for, there’d be a search option so you could, you know, jump to the team you wanna watch. Searches for Arsenal, Fulham, Leeds, etc. yield zero search results. Super helpful."
2020-07-17 02:32:30,Very poorly working/ designed app,2,shawnemccord,False,"Needs a lot of work.   All it does is pause every few minutes to think, then come back with an out of focus picture.  No way I’d pay for this service especially with the streaming issues as well as all the other issues other people wrote about.   I’ll be deleting the app."
2020-10-04 21:02:48,Needs an update soon,2,Babydoll babe,False,I understand it’s a fresh app but it would be nice if users could minimize their screen so they could use other apps at the same time. I would also like a separate page where all the shows I wanna keep watching show on their own instead of being mixed in with the others
2020-07-16 06:21:07,Chromecast Doesn’t Work,1,StroopGoop,False,"I can’t get a cable box in my room and use chromecast on my tv to compensate. After learning that the peacock app was able to chromecast, I tried it out. It would never load the show I wanted to watch and eventually would stop trying to cast. Tried another app that chromecasts  and it worked perfectly. Just seems like Peacock is advertising for something they still can’t do. Kinda bummed."
2020-07-15 15:22:06,Nbc has screwed up their sports coverage again!,1,Bungleteuropa,False,Nbc has removed premier league soccer from their main channels today and are showing on Peacock instead. After failing to get Peacock running on my pretty new Samsung Tv (browser out of date message - you have got to be kidding!) - i downloaded the Peacock TV app on my iphone. That worked ok but there is no sign of the Barclays Premier League games today. This is the NBC Sports/Gold app debacle all over again!
2020-10-07 04:48:49,Ok but cannot skip ahead,3,Mr. Salt,False,"This app doesn’t doesn’t let you skip ahead 10s, it only has the ability to scrub. Which usually causes issues if it’s anywhere near a commercial break it will start looping. 

Wish they used the skip feature from the api"
2020-08-06 13:44:15,Really?,3,C L Linker,False,The app needs to be updated within of being released a few weeks??  Really.  I was surprised all the episodes of the older shows are not available like the Carol Burnett Show.  I don’t want the peacocks news which is front and centered.  I want easy search and availability of free shows.
2020-09-20 17:09:35,I wish I could give this negative stars,1,Cat7110,False,Peacock did nothing to fix the existing issues with streaming the premier league via Chromecast. If your planning on streaming the PL on Chromecast don’t waste your money it still constantly glitches and does not work. There is no actual support as well outside of an article trying to pin blame on your internet when the issues only happen with peacock/NBC Sports gold.
2020-08-19 18:55:07,The app doesn’t work in iOS latest version,5,elcuba46,False,I tried  this app for I don’t know how menu times but every time I try to open the app close by itself any solution ???
2020-07-23 02:20:35,Do you need a newer Apple TV for Peacock to play on it?,3,I’m gonna get the papers,False,I’m not sure which generation mine is but I downloaded Peacock to my iPhone and iPad but I can’t find it anywhere on my Apple TV. I want to be able to stream it through Apple TV so I can watch on my big tv and not just smaller devices. Anyone have a similar issue?
2020-09-29 04:32:36,Really?,2,riot.thyme,False,"There’s no time out feature to ask if you’re still watching. So 20 episodes later I realize I left it running. 
Why doesn’t the player fill the whole screen? 
Who designed this? Why did they do that? Should I go download RealPlayer to make this work?
NBC, you’re a wealthy company, act like it. This app is trash. Hire someone better."
2020-07-17 03:25:20,Doubt I’ll Make It!,3,GinaBaBina!,False,"This service is Ok. But, I fought I’ll make past the free 7 day trail. The selection is lacking and very hard to navigate. Whoever designed the layout/visual, did a very poor job. The channels and ability to scroll is behind other buttons. It’s just wonky! And doesn’t fit today’s standards of design!"
2020-07-17 01:08:04,It needs more movies,4,giani49ers,False,I just got the app I haven’t watched anything yet but I go to the search button and just search up some of my favorite movies and none of them are there so please add more movies like superhero movies in car and more comedy movies like Friday
2020-07-16 16:40:29,"Unreliable video player and live streams, bad controls",1,all254,False,"Does not use the Apple TV’s native video player so you cannot use the side buttons to fast forward and rewind. Live streams have frozen video while audio continues in the background. The Apple TV screensaver kicks in IN THE MIDDLE OF VIEWING and I have not had that problem with any other apps.

Also, EPL match streams are in 30fps when industry standard is 60fps. This should not be difficult."
2020-07-16 05:54:56,"There was a problem signing up, please try again later!",1,Kso24,False,"I have tried several times over the last two days to sign up or sign in through my Xfinity account and tried a new account set up with the same error. “There was a problem signing up, please try again later!“ I have uninstalled and reinstalled the app on multiple iOS devices. Very disappointing!"
2020-10-20 12:57:47,Kloe,5,funimate fan 200,False,Hi I love this app I can finally watch all the Harry Potter shows and draco malfoy 🤤🥰 but anyways it’s all free and you all should try it it has all the shows that got taken off of tv and Netflix I highly recommend this app
2020-10-15 14:16:25,Trump’s Network,1,Once purchased $60 worth,False,I didn’t like the platform which crashed continuously in the beginning. Didn’t like the lack of choices as the streaming options were on continuous play and viewers were not able to pick a show and watch from beginning.  But now that they are all pro trump.  I will just delete. With so many choices I don’t need garbage and this application is part of a garbage dump.
2020-10-14 05:41:07,Lacking basic streaming features,1,catloverxoxoxoxo,False,"Errors quite often but the biggest is chromecast has no auto continue so each episode you must go back in. How is this not a day one feature?? Would rather pay for no ads rather than premium instead

Continued playback issues, connection issues with chromecast, still no auto play/continue"
2020-09-25 00:27:27,To many titles on premium,2,jssisjw,False,Can you please let us watch SOME THINGS without having to pay? You can easily make lots of money on ads. Pleeeease dude. I was waiting for this for a long time only to find out that I can only watch select shows and even those have ads. It would be so much easier if it just ran on adds dude.
2020-09-26 12:00:17,Using only because I am forced to,1,Tarun ipad pro,False,Premier league matches stream several seconds behind. And in 2020 these guys have decided that the way to move forward is by making things more expensive. This is the reason sounds like me have to go and search for illegal streams on the Internet. This is a bad user experience and product decision and I hope that someone elseGets the rights to Premier league very soon.
2020-08-12 03:30:07,"Content choices ok, streaming awful",2,SL Wright,False,"Peacock is offering some good content, but streaming is unreliable. I am unable to get through even one episode without the app providing a buffering error at least 3 or 4 times. Still has a long way to go before it can even think about being a competitor amongst other streaming services."
2020-09-08 05:29:11,"Awful interface, impossible to find anything specific.",1,Mr.wrestle4life,False,Literally the worst interface and navigation of any app ever. I want to watch the CURRENT English Premiere League and see the schedule but it doesn’t even appear when I do a search. Can’t look up specific teams either. It’s a shame that I can’t watch the EPL because an awful company has near exclusive rights and an impossible to use app.
2020-08-15 01:21:50,Premium is just ok,3,Little Kid Lover 4,False,"I have the mid tier and there is totally no point of getting it. You get 2/3 of the content from the free service and it has the same amount of ad length. I know the original will get better as time goes on, but right now. It is definitely not worth it."
2020-08-14 05:51:50,Background Play,3,Coffee119,False,This app would be outstanding if it could play in the background. The xfinity app does this and it’s a great feature. I can still listen to movies or tv and have some background noise while working on other apps on my phone. Please add this feature.
2020-07-27 18:42:50,"Decent content, Terrible App",2,Dizzledi,False,"This app still needs a tremendous amount of work. The fast forward and rewind functions don’t work on Apple TV. In order to get to the series page of something, you have to go hunt down or search for it even if you’re watching that exact show at the moment. Functionality is very poor."
2020-10-12 14:58:28,One of the worst streaming apps,2,Sorta disappointed fan,False,"Bugs everywhere. I know its free but the state of this app is sad. When you resume watching a show, 60% of the time it won’t load. If it does load, there is absolutely no chance it actually resumes where you left off even if you choose to continue. Browsing the app is finicky as well."
2020-07-23 02:42:52,UI Needs Work,1,thehoss123,False,"-When casting from my phone to the TV, every time it comes back from commercial, the audio isn’t matched with the speakers’ mouths, so you have to stop casting and restarting to fix it. 

-if you need to rewind/fast forward or turn on closed captioning, the screen automatically flips to the horizontal/landscape view which makes the user experience very awkward  and more difficult."
2020-07-17 19:07:27,ITS GREAT,5,smileyily,False,For something that’s free it’s the best. I love it already has all the classics that no other app has. And the format is great. I hope it stays free bc it’s worth it. Could always be better but nothing I’m complaint about right now.
2020-10-09 13:04:12,SNL on Peacock is terrible,1,This is not the real Dave Matthews,False,First you remove the stand alone SNL app where I can create playlists of my favorite sketches promising this new peacock app will be the new home of SNL. You launch with only a few seasons and now you technically have all seasons but they are cut down/edited episodes. And no option to create playlists of your fav sketches. Your SNL app wasn’t a 5 star app but it was very close. This app doesn’t do your best and deepest asset justice.
2020-10-02 02:41:10,Who creates an app that can’t be airplayed or casted??,1,Jeremy PC,False,"I waited all month to finally watch the Harry Potter series only to find out that Peacock doesn’t allow airplay or mirroring from my iPad or laptop to my apple tv! I have a first gen, so I can’t download that app onto the Apple TV. This is absolutely nuts. The interface isn’t terrible, the quality is ok. But??? I want to watch things on my TV not my IPad. Hopefully they recode that feature asap."
2020-09-19 17:03:31,No AirPlay with Subscription,2,Shellzee,False,"I downloaded this so that I could watch the Premiere League, only to find out you have to pay to watch live sports. But that’s not even the worst part. Not only did I have to pay, but I cannot watch the app on my TV because they don’t allow AirPlay, and have no apps for TVs or Firestick. Definitely canceling my subscription."
2020-08-23 17:06:50,What happened to my favorite show?,2,American greedy,False,I got this app for one show and one show only. That is my all-time favorite show American greed. Why oh why did you guys remove American greed from the app. I would watch the show over and over again. I am seriously considering deleting my app now. I don’t want to do that. Please bring the show back to Peacock.
2020-09-08 17:06:35,Content Doesn’t Get Updated,1,DLLII,False,Only use (or try to us) Peacock for The Dan Patrick Show. The shows aren’t available until the evening or the day after the show airs. It’s a daily show. So that’s not helpful. Also the show page doesn’t even have all of the past episodes. There are only episodes from 2 days. Please update the Dan Patrick Show so we can watch on demand right after the show airs.
2020-08-29 12:25:10,Awful UX. Does not have the user in mind.,1,Light Beyond the Clouds,False,"Awful app. Who designed this?! You would think with a massive organization like NBC they would be able to afford a decent UX designer. Good luck trying to find what you are looking for. Instead, content that the user has zero interest in is shoved int eh fave of the user. Previews play by themselves, no quick way to get to the content you need/want. Totally absurd. It’s a big fat pig with lipstick on."
2020-09-26 14:06:27,Not ready for Prime Time,2,Cardcm,False,"Clunky, fast forward is a nightmare no preview while you rewind or forward-it’s a guessing game in where to stop then forced to watch commercials once you get the area of the program you left off-even if you’ve watched the same commercials over and over while rewinding and fast forwarding"
2020-08-16 12:29:36,"If it ever lets me sign in, I’ll let ya know!",1,pyroxene26,False,"Don’t bother Apple TV users, no Peacock for you! After three reset passwords, this app only serves up login error messages - quite possibly the worst reality show ever! 

To be fair, I can access the app on a tablet or phone but honestly have never been a fan of holding a screen to watch a movie or binge shows. Maybe one day Peacock will let you watch on a flat screen, we'll see!"
2020-07-21 18:43:20,"Bait and switch, crap app",1,djallure,False,"I thought HBO MAX was the worst and most overpriced new streaming app by these major media conglomerates like AT&T, CBS, Comcast, and Disney....

I was wrong. Peace is even worse. They're basically just rebranding the already free NBC app.

But Comcast has been blasting commercials about how Peacock is free--which it is for a limited amount of programming, which was already free through other Comcast apps. Then they have a paid subscription option for all the other content.

Which is fine... If Comcast wasn't running around advertising their app as COMPLETELY FREE!

It's official, these big companies are ruining streaming, and the wait of their subscription fees will implode of their own greedy weight."
2020-07-15 05:04:26,Why,5,lionsethbro,False,My problem is I expected the show to come out the day it was released and it’s not out can you at leased put it out in the next three days I’m talking about Madagascar a little wild
2020-10-11 18:47:33,Let Down,1,sobadeverynicknametaken,False,"This app has been a let down and disappointment since I downloaded it. The problem started with signing up. Place email and password in and receive a message of error. Never got a chance to see a movie, tv show or any kind of entertainment. Will never recommend to anyone. Deleting App and strongly thinking about changing my Comcast/Xfinity account."
2020-09-14 19:14:07,Can’t access from mobile (iPad) app,1,MMS05011991,False,"I have Peacock Premium as a part of my Xfinity package and while it works perfectly fine when I’m at home in front of my tv, I cannot access my account on the mobile app. I’ve tried a dozen times and it does not work. Safe to say if I didn’t already receive this service for free through my cable provider, I wouldn’t sign up for it at all."
2020-09-08 03:35:50,Just another money grubbing network...,1,miller580,False,Like the cbs app...just trying to pick your wallet...and on episodes that are three years old? Oh hell no. Sorry. Not one more penny from me...these network apps are a suckers game. Plenty of fantastic shows on Netflix and amazon...nbc doesn’t want to deal with them because they want to fleece us...then their shows can die on the vine. Next step...delete app off my iPad. Good riddance.
2020-09-12 16:29:36,Great,5,Deubinfswfhn,False,I had no problems there was only like two commercials with great episodes. Also they have all of my show their with all of the seasons.
2020-08-10 03:40:46,Not ready for prime time,1,blahffer,False,"This app feels like a rush job. It was released before a smart tv app was available which isn’t ideal. It crashes a lot. The auto play for next episode only works for me if I open the app right when it’s trying to transition. It doesn’t keep track of where I left off on the main menu when I open the app. 

On the positive side the commercial breaks are short. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯"
2020-08-02 20:04:18,Terrible Playback,1,Pbc12,False,"The video player will lose track of where you are regularly. Especially bad if you leave the app briefly or fast forward/rewind. Forces you to rewatch commercials to get back to where you were. 

Home screen is terrible. No way to continue your shows even though you’re logged in. You have to search for the show. Every time the app is relaunched."
2020-09-21 16:58:42,Outrageous,1,apb_33_,False,I’m a big fan of the premier league the fact that I now have to pay for another subscription to watch my teams games is outrageous I don’t know who thought that was a good idea. Also the app runs slow has trouble loading and reverts me back to that last stop point and I can’t get it to play on my smart tv like every other streaming service can.
2020-07-30 09:54:39,Ads ?,4,Angelbunnydarling,False,"I paid for no ads with the premium package ,but I’m still getting ads during certain movies ,can I ask why ? Otherwise I love the app ,one of the reasons I bought is because it said “ no ads “"
2020-07-19 12:36:00,Not working! Great!,5,Sfbancho,False,"I was exciting about the content. However, with new update it doesn’t seem to work with older IPads on IOS12. It just dies every time I open it. That’s too bad. I guess I can’t sign up."
2020-09-19 22:55:19,Airplay sound doesn’t work for Apple TV,1,alex284966,False,"I got this app and the premium to watch the sports... and found out it doesn’t work with Airplay (maybe I am doing something wrong??) so it is shame that the app won’t do the basic stuff ... fix it so we can have a good experience... also, the UX, isn’t great , it is all mixed up, you have a lot of things to fix if you really want people to stick to it."
2020-09-19 13:58:09,Extortion,1,awthome powthome,False,"NBC is trying desperately to prop up their poor attempt at a streaming service and app. 

Not only are they forcing soccer fans to subscribe and pay extra just to watch SOME of their team’s games, but they are offering a horrible platform to watch the games on. The app is awful. The fact that they’re pulling money the way that they are is awful. Everything about this is awful."
2020-09-19 14:21:39,The Best,5,Modi Tekke,False,One of the best apps I ever use. I am greatly satisfied with this service. Watching the Premiere League is now made easy. I only wish if they can add tennis tournaments to it. Please keep the subscription fees the same.
2020-09-18 06:17:16,Please add full screen!!!,2,B10nary,False,"For the live of god, add full screen to the app, it’s hard to watch in a small box with borders add the option to let people stretch to fill screen every single streaming app lets u view in full screen!  It should be one of the main features of the app when viewing its very distracting to have the border, con on devs!"
2020-10-10 11:23:53,Terrible on laptop,2,cryan006,False,"Works fine on my smart tv but when I watch something on my laptop and leave off in the middle of the show, it always starts from the beginning even when clicking resume episode. Gave up after 4 episodes and went back to Netflix."
2020-08-25 17:50:32,Eat up all your data and not totally free!,1,Beee555,False,"I ask my husband to download this apps. He even pay for an upgrade and in 7 days, he used 70G. We never use half of that for the whole month in Netflix. My husband is on the road all the time and he watches netflix. So we decided to delete the apps and mine, too. Not free at all, only few episodes are free. If you want to watch all, have to pay."
2020-08-07 04:16:13,NO FULLSCREEN MODE! TERRIBLE SIZE!,1,Rick_Siale,False,"I like having the option to change the aspect ratio or whatever they call it. On this app you can’t take advantage of the screen size because IT DOESN’T CHANGE! I’ve been watching “Yellowstone”, which I’m surprised I enjoy. Unfortunately, the viewing size on my iPhone XS Max is do small! It’s a small 3G iPhone size screen! You can’t expand it to fill the whole screen! I ABSOLUTELY HATE VIDEO APPS THAT CAN’T CHANGE TO FULL SCREEN MODE! THIS IS A TERRIBLE APP!"
2020-07-24 14:25:57,Can’t Chromecast?,3,Claen,False,"I like the offerings, but am frustrated because it offers a Chromecast link but won’t connect to mine. I don’t have issues with any other streaming service connecting to my Chromecast - just this one. I would watch a lot more stuff if the thing would work on my TV."
2020-07-22 03:28:07,Freezes,1,ewhoa,False,"Freezes when ads should start. Sometimes you can watch something, most times you have to exit and restart the video.

Update: app still terrible, closed captions works when it feels like it no matter if you've turned it on from the beginning. Never works for the whole duration of a video, pops up then stopped randomly."
2020-07-17 08:59:21,Awesome,5,shashha,False,This app is outstanding!! For it being free I gave this a 5 star because I appreciate them for making it free unlike other streaming apps such as Netflix this app is rlly good and it works for TVs two but u will have to on Xbox
2020-08-01 10:43:37,Still buggy,2,Jeff in Lincoln Park,False,"I will try again later, but for now I am tired of fussy with it. I tried to watch an old Cheers episode 4 times.  Each time it would play for about 10 minutes then stop.  I couldn’t resume so had to start over.

I will wait for the next update before trying again."
2020-09-29 14:45:09,What is NBC thinking,1,300boi,False,"Poor stream quality, streams are consistently about 2 minutes behind, the frame rate is awful, not easily accessible on many devices. 90% of illegal EPL streams have all around better quality which is absurd for a paid subscription. There’s really nothing good to say about this app. It’s a shameless money grab from NBC, the coverage was infinitely better when it was on cable."
2020-09-23 11:34:38,Chelsea,5,chelsea doucette,False,I  like. The app but can you fix the email I have doing twice can doing only once. Please or putting on google or Facebook  or spectrum thank you
2020-09-20 12:16:18,Mirror play,1,pknckr,False,"The app is easy enough to use, but there is no peacock app on my smart tv. I figured I can mirror play it up there to watch the premiere league. Well mirror play won’t work with video I only hear the sound. I tried other video apps and they worked fine. I understand its a new service but I don’t want to watch my sports on my phone so Im giving you a bad review unless its fixed soon."
2020-09-19 15:41:53,Joke,1,Jacob_WC,False,"""Best of streaming"" is a bold claim. Considering most other streaming apps have better quality, allow you to perform basic tasks like rewind/fast forward on live events, and manage content by following leagues/teams/shows, that claim is flat or false. This isn't top 10 let alone ""best"". You can't just say things and have them be true... This is a joke, either deliberate or unintentional. Kick rocks"
2020-08-13 20:38:12,Waste of time,1,PittMoM8,False,"After loading the app on my phone, I’ve tried unsuccessfully several times on multiple days to enter my email and create a password only to get the same error message every time “sorry unable to connect at this time, try again later “. It’s frustrating and not worth my time and trouble. It’s a free app, I guess you get what you pay for!"
2020-07-18 23:34:02,Good but needs a lot of work,2,Colester0751762,False,"So I was promised an app with all of the best movies and tv shows of all time, unfortunately this is app turned out to be worst then Netflix, it had barely any good tv shows or movies. This streaming device has a lot of potential but it needs work fix the app then maybe I will start using it again."
2020-07-20 14:54:35,Won’t play video thru tv,3,Czy Mac,False,"The app won’t play streaming video thru my tv when my iPad is connected via HDMI cable. Plays sound only, no picture. Fix this bug and I’ll bump ya up to 4 stars. Nice to be able to binge Downton Abbey episodes (even on a small tablet screen) without paying the pbs extortion fees on their app :o)"
2020-10-14 21:10:33,"Good content, doesn’t work well on iPad (gen. 5)",2,Don Arney,False,"The content and quality is excellent.

HOWEVER, when streaming via my 5th Generation iPad via HDMI adapter, the video does not go to the TV, either in full screen or normal mode. This is the only streaming app that has this issue.

It works fine on my Mac Book pro via HDMI out though the Thunderbolt port."
2020-07-17 05:34:37,Content good/Interface Bad,3,Nicholasmurt,False,"As my short description suggests, I love all the diverse content on here. However the worst part about this is its availability across platforms. Not on Firestick, Samsung tv, or web browser on mobile.

Also you can’t use your phone > hdmi > tv. Not sure why because the ads play. This does however work from PC to TV. A bit inconsistent.

Hopefully this gets improved and becomes available on more platforms as well because it could be great.

I will be watching Psych Deux🍍 and then probably not logging on for some time."
2020-07-15 12:48:25,One flaw,4,Nondifferentiable,False,"You can’t be the best streaming service if you don’t allow separate viewing accounts.  That is not available here (unless I’m missing something).  If I am wrong about the accounts, I will amend my rating."
2020-07-15 07:34:23,Amazing app,5,148am,False,I have been waiting weeks to download and finally get to use the app it’s awesome it has everything you could ever need in a tv app on your phone
2020-09-30 03:31:23,You make it so hard to watch anything,1,kissmysass_,False,"You pull all your stuff from other streaming services to be exclusive to this one... ok cool fine whatever. But I can’t watch on my TV and I can’t play in the background? What am I supposed to do- stare at the phone screen all day? I really wanted to like this streaming service, but unfortunately you’ve got a LONG way to go to make it worthwhile."
2020-08-28 21:19:37,Signing up.......a Serious Problem,2,TCKC47,False,"I’ve tried 5 times to sign up for the app.  I would use it a lot on my iPad, but after completing the process and checking all the boxes, a drop box appears with a message saying there was a problem, please try again later.  How many “laters” does the app need.?
Great idea, bad implementation!!"
2020-09-12 19:00:04,Garbage,1,Phynch.,False,"Just like the other reviewer; I waited for the Premier League to return, only for the app to fail from the first go. Why do I have to pay for games, if the app won’t play? I used multiple devices plugged into multiple tv’s, and I only get a black screen. Does NBC expect us to watch sports and movies only in our phones? Sports Gold worked just fine, now we are paying more for garbage."
2020-07-21 13:46:18,Great TV choices,5,Lesview,False,First thing the picture is great and I do not have buffering like some other Services. I love this service .It will get better with programming it takes time.
2020-07-18 06:08:28,I like this app 😎,5,PinkNikky99,False,"I’ve really liked this app, ever since I’ve gotten this app 3 days ago 😊. I really appreciate that almost everything is free on there, and that the shows are very good as well 🤩."
2020-10-07 03:39:11,Possibly the worst performing streaming app available,1,Subbie78703,False,"If you are planning on using this app on your smart tv. Don’t bother. Can’t even get on demand shoes to load on great internet speed.  Literally spins for minutes then fails. 

If you only intend to watch on your iPhone it will probably work. 

But for someone who is willing to pay for the content, so far there’s no value."
2020-09-22 11:32:58,Poor all around,1,Papskier,False,"The sorting of shows is a bit ridiculous because there’s thousands of them and it’s not a great experience. Same with channels. But, then once you do find something to watch, the stream quality is crap and you can’t chromecast or use apple’s device connection. I have to use my laptop to connect to my tv and stream the website"
2020-07-26 02:46:06,Needs work,2,hermione2709,False,It would be cool if we could go half/split screen when using an iPhone or iPad. I can’t multitask at all when watching and that’s irritating. Also I’d like to see more teen shows or sitcoms like Friends as it’s basically all news and talk shows on here. Movie selection is not good at all. Please fix bc Netflix is beating you
2020-08-05 00:40:42,The channels are amazing,5,zsmith app,False,I no longer have to think about what to watch. Peacock is not just one library of tv shows and movies. It is different. The channels are super entertaining.
2020-07-24 22:09:23,Can’t use this with my Apple TV,2,Gribbly Snard,False,There is no option to broadcast from my phone to my Apple TV. This is a must-have feature for me. I personally find the app difficult to navigate to find what I want to watch. I am personally tired of having every streaming service app or service having widely different user interfaces.
2020-07-16 20:12:39,Buggy as hell...,2,Shquanana,False,"I’ve been watching Project Blue Book and about halfway through an episode the sound and video don’t sync up. Every time. Video quality also takes a while to improve. My internet connection is fine. None of this happens on Netflix, Hulu...NBC, you desperately need some bug fixes or I’ll never upgrade."
2020-07-18 16:44:48,"No 4K, premium still has ads",1,bhollllller,False,"How does a mega multi billion dollar media company launch a flagship streaming product but some how not stream 4K HDR and Dolby Atmos is beyond me. You spend billions and still miss the mark. Oh well. Also why spend $9.99 and “still may see some ads”. Who are the stodgy old media execs running this product. Could have been great if it was more like Disney+, 4K, no ads, and lower price point."
2020-07-17 18:46:02,Cast button doesn’t work.,3,Srirramm,False,"Getting a blank screen on Chromecast when I cast from Peacock. Cast icon in Peacock shows as though it is trying to connect, but it never does work. I see list of cast devices fine since I have few Chromecast. Netflix cast works from the same device."
2020-07-16 22:38:47,Stupid,1,Skiing Trumpeter,False,Why try to enter a saturated market if you’re not even going to try and compete with others? Limited availability and no hdmi support. How is a family supposed to enjoy the service if everyone has to cram around a tiny screen? Whoever decided to launch such an incomplete service needs to be fired and not allowed to create things like this again. Completely unacceptable.
2020-07-15 10:51:46,Only available in the US,1,Vivitar Reviews,False,"This app seems like it would be really awesome in terms of what’s available to watch, but it’s only available in the US...
I’m stationed overseas with the US Army, and due to this fact, I can’t access the website, or watch anything on the app.
I was really looking forward to watching Psych 2 because of my enjoyment of the series, but it got squashed by this.
Fix this NBC, don’t be punks."
2020-09-20 16:00:12,Live sports at 30fps is unacceptable for a paid service,1,Dabrickishaw,False,"I honestly don’t know how a company like NBC is incapable of offering live sports at 60fps. The premier league games are borderline unwatchable. Other subscription services, such as ESPN+ offer live sports at 60fps with impeccable streaming quality for the same price or less. I’ll be cancelling my subscription until NBC can actually offer something worth paying for."
2020-07-15 01:53:15,A Must Have!,5,Armchair_Detective,False,"Peacock TV has so many incredible shows, movies and live events that you can watch right at your fingertips! The app is smooth and looks beautiful."
2020-09-19 13:37:42,“There was a problem signing up...”,1,Fieldvue5,False,I downloaded the app on both my iPad and iPhone. Tried to sign in with my regular email and a password at least 15 times on both devises. And I get the error message “There was a problem signing up. Please try again later.” No explanation of what the problem is; no suggested way to fix it. This is ridiculous.
2020-09-13 19:17:21,Doesn’t work on my iPhone,1,Rodrigo's Notebook,False,"I can’t log in using my password that I use to log in on my tv. When I try to sign in with another email, I get a message that reads “cannot fetch information”’ or “cannot sign in at this time, please try again later”. This app is terribly frustrating and apparently useless on my phone. Somebody do something about this bug."
2020-09-13 16:23:55,Worst Streaming Service App,1,Cooper M H,False,"I cannot believe in the year of 2020 that this app refuses to let me airplay to my tv. No Roku app, no air play nothing. So I get to sit here on my phone and watch while looking at my black tv screen. Absolutely awful. Can’t even begin to imagine what big wig thought this was a decent excuse for an app while charging 5 dollars a month for absolutely awful placement of adds. Embarrassing."
2020-09-09 21:16:32,Needs to display in roku devices,4,nickname045819,False,This is a good app but I wish it can be displayed on a Roku device and I wish some movies didn’t have to be payed for.  but it has some really good old movies that most apps do not have so point for that.
2020-07-24 01:53:22,Still glitchy,2,EF1199,False,"The video and audio doesn’t match up when you are using chromecast. There is an obvious delay. I also don’t like that when you resume playing a show, it rewinds like 10 minutes back. In general, it’s difficult to navigate the app. Overall needs to work out the kinks."
2020-09-03 14:21:31,Meh,3,AFPatty,False,The content is getting better as opposed to launch day but the controls on the Apple TV app are ridiculous and the app isn’t as streamlined as you’d expect for an app on 2020. If they’d utilize the native Apple TV controls like most of major streaming apps do they’d move up the list of the top five.
2020-08-10 04:48:31,The Capture!,4,Jaybugnutty,False,"Loving the original programming, and the reruns. For the love of jeebus would you please make some way to skip the ridiculously long and labored title sequences?  The scan forward/backward interface is very touchy and not user friendly."
2020-10-08 01:57:31,Commercials in a paid service!,2,Nick Iceman,False,"What a joke, even with the premium package there are still commercials. It also crashes frequently and fails to load. Stick with any other of the ten paid streaming services you already have, this one is garbage."
2020-07-17 18:12:26,So far so good,4,DaveAl,False,Content is good and streaming has been jitter free. The search function lacks the ability to search by actor/actress or director. Plus if it comes up not finding a answer there’s no way to return to main dashboard.
2020-07-16 16:08:28,For some users,5,dihdhh,False,The app only lets you use iPhones and iPads so if you are watching shows Alone it’s great and if you have an iPad you can watch movies with kids.
2020-07-15 06:05:55,No iPad PiP... Completely Unacceptable,1,wolfmason,False,"This app will never merit anything more that one star until iPad Picture-in-Picture is supported. This is one of the worst app-launch decisions I’ve ever seen. 

In 2020, iPads are much, much more than dedicated media consumption devices. Without the ability to multitask, Peacock will never get used on my iPad. It’s that simple. You won’t get any subscription fees or ad views from me on this one, NBCUniversal."
2020-08-16 05:24:17,Content,2,69FRxG69,False,I get that this is a free streaming service and I really shouldn’t complain but from what I can tell so far there are a lot of older movies and a lot of bad movies in my opinion. I would love to see bigger titles with 5 star reviews like Doctor sleep and more modern movies especially horror even if it was from the 80’s to 2020.
2020-09-21 03:41:52,Just a suggestion,5,_Perrin_,False,Downloading a movie/tv show... you can put that in your suggestion box... but anyways the app is good... got my favorite tv on there (two and a half men) so yea!
2020-09-20 18:43:33,This app is horrible for watching Premiere league,1,unhappy roju user,False,"This App is a dumpster fire for watching premiere league compared to Fubo.

No clear way to schedule recordings. No clear way to record. No clear way to fast forward or rewind. No clear way to pause. Sometime it lets you; sometimes it doesn’t.
If you switch to a different app and go back to Peacock it doesn’t remember where you have left off. It also seems to be blocking attempts to beam to my television so my kids and I watch games huddled around a phone screen.  

It would be a great app if it was 2007 and an undergraduate computer science project.  Fubo TV is light years beyond this joke of an app"
2020-09-20 11:44:30,Not able to sign up,1,Poppafoxtrot71,False,"Been trying to sign up for the app since it came out. Keep getting an error message after entering an email and password,

“ There was a problem signing up. Please try again later.”

This has been happening since the app came out. Tried deleting it and reinstalling but having the same issue."
2020-09-16 17:44:42,NBC app is terrible,1,Nfgood,True,"Can’t sign in, no customer service available. I only want to watch the premier league, why fix something that’s not broken. NBC online service has always been awful.

Update: 
NBC sent a link saying they would like to investigate my issues, the link took me to the same dead end customer service portal I originally complained about. Terrible."
2020-09-14 00:57:52,5$ pay wall for EPL,1,ol206,False,"They put EPL games that were free last year with cable subscription behind a $5 pay wall for their app.  I know it’s not a lot but it’s ridiculous, I already had the cable subscription and if I want to watch extra epl games I have to pay. 

Why not just make a packet/ subscription with all EPL access people, including me, would pay to have all EPL games in one app."
2020-08-08 04:33:54,Needs improvement,3,Aidanerys,False,"Layout could be improved by making it easier to see your watch list. Also, the fast-forward function could be better on AppleTV"
2020-09-22 20:32:23,Cannot login or signup,3,Evereddie60,True,"I was unable to sign up using the app, but I finally managed to sign up using my desktop browser and signing up on the website then using those credentials to sign on the app. Round about way but it worked."
2020-07-27 02:09:58,"Ads work fine, but not actual shows...",1,jdub2389,False,"There’s no app to watch this on my Apple TV or my Samsung Smart TV. So I tried to screen share from my phone to my Apple TV. The ads played perfectly fine, but then the show stopped playing on my TV as soon as the ads were over. It was playing fine on my phone. Why is it called Peacock TV if you can’t play it on a TV??!?! Uninstalled."
2020-07-18 03:30:05,Has room for improvements,1,j4jason83,False,"The app is ok, but needs improvements to make it better. There are no controls to fast forward or rewind. This a basic function and it’s not even there. When watching on the TV, can’t even see how long till the shows ends. Can’t even back it up 15 seconds if you need too. This functions needs to be added ASAP."
2020-10-15 03:35:09,Where's the back and forward 10 sec options?,4,Douglas Ochoa,False,"I truly don't understand why this app doesn't have a 10 or 15 sec fwd / bck option on Apple TV.

It almost a ""must have"" now days."
2020-09-20 14:39:20,This app is a complete scam,1,mike16mufc,False,"Constant interruptions in the feed. Always blurry, another way nbc is trying to scam more money out of true sports fans. Can’t watch the game you love anymore without paying for these outrageous subscriptions. Shame on you nbc. if you want to justify paying for this joke, at least make sure you’re providing quality content and a good stream.."
2020-09-18 11:47:02,Any worse way to watch sports?,1,Beninark,False,"I can’t believe I am saying this but I believe NBC wants peacock to fail. Looking for a soccer match? Try Browsing...nope. Try searching “Premier” for Premier League no results. Type the club name...hey you get an upcoming game. What about that replay you were promised after 9pm. Who knows?

Apparently, organizing the content on your app is very hard. Forget the fact that you can’t watch on Roku."
2020-07-17 19:39:20,Picture doesn’t show when using AirPlay,2,the app rater 123456688,False,"I tried to watch shows on my TV using AirPlay but picture won’t show. Only sound is fine. 
When there’s a commercial both sound and picture are shown on the TV. Ridiculous. 
Another scam to buy a device to stream their service."
2020-09-13 16:56:46,Joke,1,Calvin17,False,"This is the worst app I’ve ever had been forced to use. Well the NBC gold app was decent and allowed me to actually watch a game on my television. I now have to stream English Premier matches to my tiny smart phone. I’ve never been more frustrated. Why release something, make customers pay for it and not build in a feature that you could at least stream to a smart TV? NBC is a F****  joke"
2020-09-06 02:26:59,No Mirroring is a Joke,1,jaanb,False,"I downloaded and installed the Peacock app for the sole purpose of giving it 1 star and writing this review. The singular reason being the app does not allow for mirroring from your iPhone or iPad to a TV. This is an absurdity beyond comprehension. I’m sure NBC has a legit piracy or revenue loss reason for doing this, but they need to get over it and figure this out, turn it on and let us all socially isolate"
2020-09-03 03:28:09,Not able to stream to any device!!!,1,Epowerboy,False,I have the app on my phone but I can’t stream with cable or with wireless mirroring to my TV. What’s the point to pay you money if I can’t use it? How is it possible to spend that much money for such a horrible service? Did somebody tell you that it’s normal to have issues in the beginning? They’ve lied to you. Unbelievable!!!
2020-09-02 04:15:56,Fastfoward integration,1,keith34595,False,"Why do you not let people fastforward using the Apple TV remote? Why can you not fastforward on the iPhone/iPad? Seriously I’m paying for no commercials but I wanted to skip past the title sequence. However, I have to swipe up hope that I slide far enough ahead in the show to not miss anything. Just let me use the remote to skip ahead 10 seconds at a time."
2020-08-05 02:23:11,Leaves a lot to be desired,1,Mandilu24,False,"We have the basic plan, so I’d don’t know if that makes a difference in the app itself or just in programming. That being said, the search feature is terrible, it suggests things that are irrelevant. There is no option for multiple profiles and no auto play.  The app itself is not very user friendly."
2020-07-18 22:03:02,Ok but buggy,3,ditchjr,False,"Decent content but the Apple TV app doesn’t support subtitles when watching movies. Could find no option to turn them on. Found an option for a live news broadcast in the app, but even when turned on, no subtitles."
2020-07-18 01:55:40,Not great,3,jcheatham,False,"I only downloaded this app to watch Psych 2 - which I did. However, it had two minutes of add at the beginning of the movie. That’s insane! I’ll probably just go back to any other streaming app now, no reason for that amount of ads."
2020-10-16 12:28:42,Terrible User Interface,2,SR244,False,You can’t save the shows you watch anywhere and have to type them into to the search bar hoping they come up every time you open the app.  It’s a clutter of random content thrown at you on the home screen and nothing more.
2020-07-15 05:02:54,ios app has annoying white bar on bottom during playback,4,amywarr,False,Got it for psych 2. ios app has annoying white bar on bottom during playback
2020-09-01 02:23:10,Disappointed,2,Ettqa100,False,"Giving two stars because of the exclusive Psych movie and extra AP Bio season but I use my phone to play context on my tv. Like many other users, Peacock does not allow for this. I’m not going to have my family sit around my phone to watch a movie. Might as well delete the app I guess."
2020-10-13 16:41:45,Stole my payment,1,JonnyVBTU,True,"I bought the premium subscription, which charged to my card, and it only gives me access to the free content. The trial period worked fine but when I actually paid is when it stopped working.

Update: It eventually allowed me to see premium content again but it double charged me. This app is a mess."
2020-09-12 12:56:52,Hmmmm,3,cosmos1000,False,"I just signed up for Peacock Premium and noticed that live soccer match is not shown on Peacock. I have to watch it on yet another app “NBC”. I would have expected if I am paying for a service I can watch combined channels in one app as it is done on ESPN where ESPN+ is a link on the homepage, all in one spot."
2020-09-04 13:50:45,You Lied,1,Joshua Bonifacio,False,Peacock is supposed to be free I wanted to watch cleopatra in space but it’s premium I don’t know why you guys keep doing premium but it’s wrong whoever created premium needs to be really fired because Peacock is not free as a bird or the best streaming service the worst So You’re going to make an update to say that there will be no premium anymore so do it right now or else. 😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡
2020-08-19 06:02:59,"Never really use, because...",3,deadmanplaid,False,"There’s some attractive content here, but I always stop watching after a few seconds because I keep forgetting there’s no picture in picture. Can’t multitask with? Then it’s of little practical use to me."
2020-08-05 04:28:25,"Awesome, if it worked consistently",3,walleyemkr,False,"Freezes a LOT with most recent version. Fixed if I minimize and then go back to full screen, but who wants to do that every 4 or 5 min??? I have so far enjoyed the content but can’t rake much more of it’s janky functionality."
2020-08-06 20:34:55,"Great, but need some improvements.",5,LiljohnMiamiPrince🤑💰,False,"It's glitches up every now and then, but other than that it's a good app to use. It is on the rise of being a very good app."
2020-07-28 18:14:58,Not as advertised,1,TeeChild,False,"If you sign up for a trail of a particular plan, your trial will be for a better plan than you’ll be getting when they start charging you. During my trial for “premium”, I would have one ad during an hour long episode of a show. When my trial ended and they started charging me, that went to 5 ads each episode. Pretty sneaky, Peacock. Bad bird!"
2020-07-25 06:13:34,Great coverage of English Premier League,5,Wunderluft,False,Love the extra games streaming live on peacock. Maybe add some Premier League games from past as well. It would be great if you could show Indian Cricket Premier League as well
2020-07-15 23:17:18,Great Start,5,KJ1978,False,"Great selection.

But lags a bit and definitely needs Picture in Picture for iPad; otherwise great start.

Please continue to update!"
2020-07-27 00:03:25,Does not remember where you left off,2,playbackmemory101,False,Good content but if you leave to take a call it will not remember where you were and will go back sometimes even to the beginning and then you have to watch commercials just to get back to where you were
2020-10-17 22:13:59,Garbage,1,BryGoss,False,This needs work. It’s as if they released the app as soon as could stream. Nobody thought through the functionality. Makes you get the app for certain games because they know fans will pay for this crap so they don’t miss out. They don’t offer play from beginning or ability to record. It’s extremely agitating.
2020-10-10 04:39:58,Fix the scrubbing,1,Kenneth F. Powers,False,"Every other video app makes it easy to rewind and fast forward on AppleTV and lets you click to go forward or backwards a few seconds. Not this one! Horrible. Peacock devs: try literally any other major streaming app and copy their functionality.
To be clear, I’m not referring to livestreams like some other reviewers but catalogue episodes."
2020-10-04 11:31:18,Constant Errors,1,Tescelson,False,"Cannot watch one program with the screen pausing, the quality of the video is constantly changing. Great library but you cannot watch it without cursing through the program. Also big soccer fan and now instead of using there NBC Sports channel, they are using the app half of the time which I explained above is useless."
2020-09-20 15:54:18,Absolutely garbage,1,Mrmatt1877,False,The constant cash grabs from NBC for money is ridiculous for sports. First I was able to watch premier league games with my cable subscription. Then they started charging $60 a year for nbc sports gold to watch all the games. Now they want an additional 5 a month to watch the games they have moved to peacock. This is more like poppycock. I guess I’m just done with it.
2020-09-18 15:10:06,App is terrible.,1,Justinawesomeallthetime,False,"This app is terrible. I find most NBC related apps to be poor in quality. Craps our ever time the channel takes a commercial break and you have to restart it. Does not work with the HDMI dock connect for iPhone. And streaming quality, despite good cell service or WiFi, is terrible. NBC is terrible with their platforms compared to the other major networks."
2020-09-05 10:37:51,Watchlist,3,Liljusay,False,"Love the content but on the app, where is my watchlist! Easy to add shows/movies but can't find it. Should be at the bottom with the browse, trending, channels. No problem finding the watchlist when you go directly to peacock website. Fix the app please"
2020-08-27 21:11:09,Too limited,3,Gramsjc,False,"I would like to love this... the problem is it isn’t supported on my Roku, Firestick or TV.  I would love to bring it up on my tv and watch shows I have enjoyed. That way my iPad is freed up... give me access in more ways and I’d pay for the ad free version."
2020-08-02 23:19:55,"Ummm, y’all need to figure",1,rachiierach,False,"your editing out. In the middle of watching any of the “originals” and the “commercial” cuts will happen in the middle of someone speaking. What?! Or weird fade outs like a commercial is about to come on, but won’t. And what’s the point of paying for the app if you’re not going to have all the episodes of any particular show. Doesn’t make sense."
2020-07-16 12:32:43,Disappointed with tv series content,2,ms001256,False,"I thought that because this is NBC owned, all seasons of popular shows such as the Chicago shows would be available, but it seems like only the most recent seasons are available and those can be found on other streaming sites."
2020-10-18 12:26:56,Wasted potential,2,AJ2078,False,"This app has decent content and a decent video player but the UI and UX is among the worst. It is nearly impossible to find a specific genre of show, and the scrolling is laggy. You would imagine a company this large would be able to create a semi functional app."
2020-07-15 19:51:31,Mobile app is awful,1,justtryintobid,False,Tried for 10 minutes to watch a live game since all premier league games can only be watched on peacock today. All it would play was endless previews for its own tv shows and never got to the game. Tried closing and opening the app multiple times and it would never play the only thing I wanted to watch. Thanks for nothing NBC.
2020-10-12 21:47:05,Paid for Premium but can’t access episodes,2,qdvvuis,False,"I paid for the Premium at $9.99 but the application will not allow me to play the episodes. It kept asking to upgrade to Premium on all my devices. I tried to delete the Peacock app, re-install, still have the same issue."
2020-10-17 14:12:02,Pretty worthless,1,SouthernFriedHoosier,False,No real shows worth subscribing for.   Putting Premier League on their Premium Tier puts a really bad taste in my mouth. They should put it on the free tier for now then reassess in a year or two when they get shows to justify the Premium service. CBS has Star Trek which I assume gets most of their subscribers. NBC just doesn’t have enough and are a bit late to the game.
2020-07-26 22:48:37,"Good content, can’t get it onto my TV",3,zoekay99,False,"It’s got a lot of content, some of which you do need a paid account for. Brave New World is worth it alone. However I have to watch everything on my iPhone, cannot get it to work on Apple TV or screen mirror to Apple TV from phone."
2020-09-27 15:33:57,You’ve ruined watching sports with this app,1,mdmdk5@##(3'r,False,"This is the first app review I’ve written I’m so frustrated w/ this app the the motivation behind it and pulling some matches here, others on NBCSN. Icannot pause play. I cannot fast forward or rewind to watch a play again. I can’t record games or skip commercials. It’s a disaster for enjoying soccer, almost as if it that was the intent. I’m furious."
2020-09-26 14:06:37,Destroying Premier League in the USA,1,BenG DubStyle,False,"The app itself is poor- glitchy, late with a Roku version, no fireTV version, no airplay or phone mirroring allowed. The approach NBC is taking by putting previously available games behind a double pay wall is reprehensible. I pay for nbc sports than I have to pay again for peacock? You are making the game inaccesible for the average man. Your greed is disgusting."
2020-09-17 23:14:56,Free US Open peacock streaming,1,poodservice,False,I have watched 57 commercials about Peacock free streaming sign up now. I have signed up 15 different times and still cannot watch U.S. Open free golf streaming from  Peacock.... Boooo App Boooo.... i’m going to do my best to delete this Booo promotion of streaming to watch the US Open....something tells me I’m going to get a bill soon for something I never watched...Thanks NBC keep up the good work
2020-07-17 01:31:05,Chromecast does not work,3,Lani_babe,False,The content looks nice even though the ads are super long. Chromecast doesn’t work and just shows a blank screen. It’s also not available on Samsung TV. Please update ASAP so I don’t have to watch everything on my phone.
2020-07-21 17:54:45,User interface,5,rolandfantom,False,Best user interface. It just maybe add mire tabs. Best dark them with yellow in edge . Amazing. Free version will  dominate all streaming app. It’s revolutionary in streaming app with this free version and features.
2020-07-19 16:40:32,Audio sync issues,2,amber121267,False,"When the free app moves to commercials it has issues syncing. Also kept skipping the same minute and a half of a movie. I had to get past the jump point to be able to see a critical moment. 

Decent content, looking forward to more"
2020-07-16 18:01:36,New fave streaming service,5,arielk2018,False,"It’s finally here! I’ve been counting down the days til Peacock was available. I’ve already started Brave New World, and the Ryan Lochte documentary is next on my list."
2020-10-18 18:08:20,♿️♿️,5,Takuache kuh,False,I dont know about yall but it works perfectly fine for me 🤩 I have a iPhone 11 and good WiFi and I could watch what I want with good quality 😄
2020-10-17 15:15:54,Idk what to say,5,Jade Vazquez,False,Everyone is saying how bad the quality is but it seems fine to me I was watching Harry Potter 3 and the quality is fine.
2020-09-20 23:35:18,Get a samsung app,1,FrustratedPepper,False,The fact that i paid for a year of service and cant project this to my Samsung smart tv is an issue. There is neither an app and the apple tv app doesn't work with this content. This needs a samsung app stat. I have every desire to support the content creators of the series in Peacock and yet the app and paid subscription has turned out to be an utter waste of money
2020-09-19 16:19:55,Poor service and constant commercials.,1,Str1der_var,False,"Paying $9.99 a month for premium subscription does not give you anything better. Have the time screen is blank and live streams don’t launch with content. To top it all off, there are constant commercials instead of programming. Why charge a premium for a service that does not deliver the goods."
2020-09-13 00:46:29,Airplay,1,Capt.Hoek,False,"It’s 2020, why can’t this app stream to an Apple TV? Even my airplay won’t work with it....sick of companies enticing us with shows that we can only watch via their own private garbage apps. 
And now when I try to fast forward it gives me an add and puts me back to the beginning...
Fix it and earn some stars! You’re NBC....you can’t make an app that’s 5 star worthy?!"
2020-08-25 08:25:56,Idk yett it might be good it might not ill up date you guys inna week,5,hehe 🙈,False,I just downloaded this app i am sooo happy that it is working imma be using it alotttt! If anything goes wrong then imma delete that app 😠 and restall it 😛
2020-07-20 04:21:32,"Love the idea, but the app itself gets one star",1,Shaunnyboy,False,Love the content- the selection of movies and shows and what not. Functionality of searching and browsing is nice. But I’m giving one star for the app because it doesn’t connect successfully with my Chromecast. The cast just is stuck while trying to connect and the tv screen is plain black. And then it fails.
2020-09-26 04:01:08,Brand New User,2,YassJay,False,"Just got it and already am having issues. It crashes when I try to go to episodes, *sigh* I’m a bit disappointed. I’ll uninstall and try again later good luck to you guys! I still love this whole concept, it has a lot of my favorite shows."
2020-07-15 21:23:36,Fix your app,1,Joecorn,False,I download this app trying to watch the psych movie and I pay for premium and there’s 160 seconds of commercials and I try to connect the app from my phone to the television but it doesn’t work and we don’t have the right television to download it so I have to use my phone and connect it to the chrome cast and that doesn’t work
2020-09-19 17:57:43,No streaming on tv!,2,Lucie1026,False,"So you can only use this app on your phone/tablet/computer. You can’t stream to any smart tv through chrome cast or screen mirroring. It only plays sound and no video. In this age of streaming and mirroring, this app is useless if you want to watch on tv. There’s no app on the smart TVs too!"
2020-09-12 19:33:45,"Trash app, doesn’t sync with Apple TV app",1,yu10389,False,Purchased a premium subscription and couldn’t sign in to the Apple TV app. Said my password was invalid. Same password works on the iPhone app. Multiple account management issues. You guys have sabotaged a decent streaming service with your trashy developers and feature testers. Not gonna use this sorry excuse for an app again.
2020-09-08 20:08:06,No Support. Louse Subtitles,1,fhjihbvcryn,False,"I customized the subtitles and they would not change.  I had tiny white subtitles that I couldn’t see.  
I signed up for 1 week complimentary service. Within the week I tried to cancel and it wouldn’t let me.  Once I was outside the week, I was able to...huh.  I would like a refund and I can’t find any way to talk or chat with PEACOCK.  Leave to NBC to rip me off."
2020-07-27 16:06:13,Not user friendly,1,kvudjejs,False,Very poorly made app. Not user friendly at all. Not many options for casting to smart TVs and the app will not auto play the next episode if you are watching a series. The shows will just randomly stop playing half way through the episodes. And it’s not easy to search for specific episodes.
2020-07-15 07:12:11,Missing some features,3,DerWesty,False,"Good selection but a few bugs/issues: Where is the watch list after I add my desired series to it? Also, when I watch live tv, how do I exit the broadcast back to my main menu?"
2020-10-13 22:43:08,I really recommend for anyone,5,trevor lecy,False,It lets you watch anything for free right now I’ve watched 2 Harry Potter’s and that would cost is $30
2020-10-03 13:10:43,Trash,1,kaseyd92,False,"The only thing I watch on NBC is EPL soccer, which should play on the NBC channels as opposed to hidden away on this poorly made app. NBC has instead decided to play rerun hockey shows so instead of paying ANOTHER fee to peacock to just stream soccer, I will be streaming these games for free somewhere else and complaining to YouTubeTV about NBC and NBCSN as well. Soccer is your highest rated show, put it back on regular tv"
2020-09-29 15:40:16,I want AMBER,1,WonderSerena,False,I love Amber Ruffin and I have been waiting for her own show. I downloaded the app and wanted to watch her first show and I can hear her but cannot see her. It’s just a blank screen. The commercial for AP bio was seen in the commercial for Maybelline was seen but not the actual show. Come on peacock! You can’t just show us commercials and not the actual show!
2020-09-19 16:08:25,Why can’t sports be on one app?,1,FogetPeacock,False,"NBC, seriously?!  You have to split EPL b/w two apps?!  Why can’t you make it simple and easy and keep sports on NBCSN app?  If i want to watch a game on Peacock I have pay for Premium.  Are you going to make me pay for NBCSN Gold too?  I can’t wait for some other network to pick up EPL tv rights.  Do you know what sound the Peacock app makes when it crashes into the NBCSN app....douche."
2020-07-20 05:16:05,It’s OKAY🥴,2,Weirdo🥴,False,"Overall, this app isn’t that great. When I downloaded the app and opened it, it just kept on kicking me out. Sooo I went online and I saw their “great” shows that they have. I tried looking up movies to watch but you have to PAY to watch the good ones🥱😒sooo I would rather stick with Netflix. Thanks anyways😊"
2020-08-27 18:33:15,Needs some work,3,Turf guy 68,False,"This app needs to be able to run in the background, with the audio. It shuts down the audio every time you go to work on something else, on iOS."
2020-07-26 11:42:32,Too much scrolling,3,KAL1969,False,I have to scroll through every episode of the season to get to the current one. Why aren’t the new shows at the top? There should be an easier way to access new content.
2020-07-19 02:46:56,Audio Does Not Match,2,GigglesTherapy,False,I have watched more than one thing in the app & each time the audio is either ahead of the show or behind which makes it difficult to watch. I uninstalled the app hoping it would solve the problem but it didn’t fix it.
2020-07-19 18:29:08,Good content but kinda needs work,4,_.valeM,False,I like the content but Is not available in some places and if u install and then accidentally erase the app it wouldn’t let u log in for a while
2020-07-23 15:59:23,50 %load 30% scam 20% bad,2,gamemanboy2764,False,"I like but it does not have the content it says it would and when I search something it takes 10 minutes to load so they need to fix     
And I  at great WiFi so I would give it 3 stars ⭐️ ⭐️⭐️ so if this happens to you I would delete it."
2020-10-15 22:55:40,Presidential speeches/interviews,1,CadMon is CadMon,False,"It is appalling that NBC scheduled their talk with President Trump at the same time as candidate Biden’s talk on another network, forcing the voters to choose between the candidates. I’ve never thought of the networks as being politically sided. Why they would choose to alienate half of their viewers is unwise to say the least.  And I for one will be uninstalling the app until NBC chooses to be non-partisan."
2020-09-19 13:19:03,Pay for both?,1,bjlmills,False,"I have a sports package which includes a few channels I watch for sports. Now I have to download an app that doesn’t work for my tv and pay even more to watch the games I thought I was paying for? No thanks, I’m going to pay for the subscription to the teams streaming service instead. Strange way to do business."
2020-09-19 04:41:12,Greedy nbc ruining premier league with peacock paywall,1,Daniel1996C,False,Forced to download this app because nbc wants to setup a paywall and not televise premier league games. Besides the fact the app is garbage and doesn’t stream to a lot of devices like lg or roku (they just made a deal with roku today) it is idiotic for nbc to be so greedy and ruin premier league experience for so many people. They are hurting the growth of the game in America with this garbage setup.
2020-09-13 19:51:00,NBC double dipping. Terrible app for 2020!,1,(ucas,False,"Deceptive marketing for plan options, limited shows/live sports, user interface is garbage and the app is limited to few device options and cannot cast/stream to TV. Obviously NBC double dipping from its cable options, making customers pay for content they previously could access for free."
2020-08-21 18:09:12,Free shows,5,Polevata314,False,"What’s not to love. I have iphoneX and it works for me. Don’t expect free after first episode, but so far, I’ve gotten past a lot of first episodes for free. Pleasantly surprised by this app"
2020-08-17 05:51:22,Review,1,Pillowpalls,False,Ok I get that you want people to use your app but when you actually get in the app most of the shows that people like you have to pay for them. The shows people don’t like? They’re free. And I’m the add it made it seem like everything was free but it wasn’t. If you’re gonna sell this app you should at least say that it costs money. 😔
2020-07-25 06:48:47,No Chromecast,1,kayky32,False,"Who’s very excited to watch murder she wrote when I downloaded the app. Watching has been fine. But every time I go to cast to my TV, it doesn’t work. I looked up online and peacock says they’re compatible with Chromecast. I’ve been trying for three days off and on, and it still won’t work. It’s just a blank screen. Otherwise the app is OK"
2020-07-20 03:17:26,Dissappointed,2,Izzy4usa,False,I thought this was going to be at least somewhat like cbs all access but it’s not even close and not even available on rocky so it’s use will be very limited. It also won’t remember where you were at if you go back in to watch a show
2020-07-16 07:51:30,Decent content but the cost structure blows,3,chiefey68,False,"I’m sorry, paying for the premium plus package and still having ads is obnoxious; there isn’t any overwhelming content here that’s really worth streaming for both a fee and ads."
2020-07-16 13:36:10,Upon further review,5,Jerry7709,False,"I thought this was another Pluto TV clone but I was wrong. They have some great content here some decent movies, TV shows and original content. Good job."
2020-09-21 01:15:10,So frustrating,1,pdubs18,False,"To watch Premier League soccer we have to buy this subscription on top of the cable subscription we already have. I will switch to watching Bundesliga and other leagues that come with cable. I am absolutely sick of all these individual subscriptions for a ton of horrible content with one winner. NBC is not ESPN, Apple or Disney. Best of luck."
2020-07-15 16:10:57,Free and easy to use!,5,justseels,False,"So much free content and the app is beautifully designed, so it’s easy to browse or find exactly what you’re looking for."
2020-09-21 01:09:12,Horrible app and service for premier league,1,customer 3000,False,"Homework for the developers:

The NBC sports app was an excellent option, but NBC got it totally backwards with this app. 

1. The app lacks the basic features of all apps today. 
2. I paid a subscription with my iPhone and they took my money,
3.  but there is no way to see the game in my iPad.
4. No way how to change email or password. 
5. No way to plug my iPhone to the TV. 
6. No way to to link my account to the tv app. 
7. No way to link my account to my xfinity account. 

Basically, I’m locked to watch a soccer game in a 6” screen. Go figure. 

Canceling the subscription."
2020-09-19 15:40:25,Garbage,1,Awesomefletch0069,False,"The fact that this isn’t compatible for direct airplay from IPad or IPhone is ridiculous. Then you can’t pause live sports or rewind. Again, what a joke. Do the right thing NBC, fix this piece of trash App or quit putting live sports on their exclusively and charging for premium content every month when there are no premium features."
2020-09-15 20:39:22,Not streaming,2,12rhonda,False,First they say it’s “free”. But you’re unable to open the app up. They keep telling you to try again later. So when is later? I can only watch it on my iPad. Not my TV nor my iPhone. Who wants to carry they I pad out the house. And only you can watch it by yourself
2020-07-26 17:36:07,Needs work,2,HofstraJet,False,The iPhone app needs a lot of work to make it usable. Can’t find a way to access the watchlist. Need a setting to turn off the autoplay when scrolling channels or shows. Settings should be available from every screen not just Trending.
2020-08-30 14:16:47,Junk,1,Raquel726,False,"Absolute junk. It was working fine on my iPhone then just stopped. It took 30 min to get a chat agent. They told me to delete and reinstall, now I can’t even sign in. Says it doesn’t know my sign in info (but they know it enough to charge me) Won’t even load on the tv.  I will be demanding a refund. Don’t waste you time or money!"
2020-08-12 01:49:26,Peacock,5,mkthedude,False,"This app is insane they have all the classics completely free we’re talking columbo, the Rockford files, Tarantino movies, and so on buy this app now you won’t regret it"
2020-08-02 23:36:36,Streaming,1,Bb41,False,"My family and I are really looking forward to watch the new Psych movie. We’re using and adapter to watch it on the tv. The show gets going ok, all of the commercials show on the screen. But then once it gets to the actual show, nothing. We can hear it, but it’s only playing on my phone, and not on the screen."
2020-07-21 19:58:32,No Premier League football (soccer),2,stebeneb,False,"The main reason I got this app is so that I could finally watch the premier league, I can never find it when I search it up, nor can I find it on sports, and I feel like that unless you search up the exact title you won’t find anything"
2020-07-23 16:56:50,Awesome,5,SethAaronSandidge,False,"I hope this app remains free. If so, I’ll stop paying for my other tv apps 😃. I have already recommended this app to a few. It’s nice, I enjoy the shows on it."
2020-07-21 18:06:54,"Content decent, app terrible",2,VandyMichael,False,"I got a trial to watch Brave New World. The content otherwise seems pretty good. The app is awful. No PiP, watchlist is impossible to find, can’t see the time without exiting the app which closes it. I won’t be keeping anything other than free content after my week is up."
2020-07-17 03:06:23,Need to work out the bugs,3,ClayThompson24,False,After every commercial break the audio and video are out of sync and I have to pause the show and rewind to restart with sync. Happens every single time with chrome cast.
2020-07-15 18:48:14,No PIP on iPad,3,itunes_blah,False,"Why is not done on any of the NBC apps, it’s simple to do, as a developer there’s no way I wouldn’t add this, please add because it makes the app much more useful if you suddenly have to check an email but still want the picture showing."
2020-07-15 08:11:02,Awful,1,Jungle Jesse,False,The layout is awful. The library can be found almost anywhere else. The channels are a poor attempt to copy PlutoTV. You have no option for Comcast subscribers to log in for the premium version and there is no way I’m paying extra for this. I’m deleting the app because even the free version isn’t worth it.
2020-10-17 03:37:35,Best app!!! Better than the NBC app!!!,5,Tangolongo,False,This app let’s me watch my shows with just one ad break!!! Most of the time no ads during my shows!!! TOTALLY RECOMMEND!!! 100% Free!!!
2020-09-28 16:47:49,Apple TV app needs work,3,this app is so bad still,False,"They need to make the video playback controls more like the rest of TVOS. Being able to jump forward and back ten seconds, or skip thru intro credits in tv shows would be great"
2020-09-26 15:36:20,Pathetic,1,Bhjhgjjgfjjfdfhhfdc,False,What in the world has happened to this app?  All of the sudden I can’t pause a show I’m watching?  There’s also no way to scroll through the program?  So now if I’m halfway though a show and I need to step away for ten minutes my choices are 1. Miss those ten minutes or 2. Start over at the beginning.  Pathetic.
2020-09-20 14:32:10,"New app, already out of date",1,Jono2014,False,"Given all the development effort that NBC put into this app, how have they failed to make it compatible with the new Picture in Picture feature in iOS 14?  If you’re going to keep making me pay more to watch premier league games, I at least expect your app to be up to date."
2020-08-28 20:20:05,Recommend it,5,PorousThunder-35,False,"Super great, you have access to a multitude of shows regardless of wether or not your subscribed to there premium shows."
2020-07-27 20:03:13,Password,1,Noah Zarc,False,"To tell you the truth I’m just done with creating passwords for every single app. If you can’t be bothered to integrate with google our some other password service then I think I’m done. 

Just downloaded and logged into iMDBs app using my google account and was watching a movie in seconds— and I don’t have another password to remember."
2020-07-15 23:13:45,"It’s ok, but empty",3,Scooter1061,False,"Why is it that this service is empty of recent shows? My main issue is that there is only the last season each of Chicago Fire, PD, and Med. why? I heard lots of news in the last week that the whole series would be on here."
2020-07-16 04:00:33,No Closed Captions in TVOS,1,Jeff from Portland,False,"The Capture is difficult without closed captioning. For some reason you decided to make some clever new way to do the captioning interface and made something that doesn’t work at all. Well done on spending all that extra money by not using the SDK. No worries, a torrent version with captions is minutes away."
2020-10-17 02:19:51,No issues,4,Dr.hatetrump,False,It’s good but I see a lot of an issue of people getting to cast first of all it has to be downloaded on you tv and then cast but over all I like the app
2020-09-27 05:05:34,This app is unusable,2,Tech3xpert,False,"It used to work and it was great. But then I updated to iOS 14, and the app is incompatible or something. For an app this size, we shouldn’t have to worry about things like this. It just crashes on launch, no matter how many times I retry, or reinstall the app"
2020-10-16 11:30:14,Doesn’t take you to resume last watched,3,br1957a,False,The app won’t take you to what you watched last to resume. Although if I access it through Apple TV it shows where you are.
2020-10-13 05:56:20,Ads cutting off parts of the movie,1,iiKawaiiDesu,False,"I’m watching a movie or series, and when the ads play, it cuts off a large or small portion of the movie.
Example, I’m watching harry potter and i certainly remember Harry getting sorted, getting his wand, and other school supplies, but the Ads cut all of that off.
Terrible, do not use this app to watch new series or movies."
2020-10-10 03:49:01,And I thought “are you still watching?” Was annoying.,1,gogogirl929,False,"No auto play. 
I like to fall asleep to tv and put the tv sleep timer on. This makes it so annoying. There is no auto play. I have to manually click on my phone every time I want to continue a show. This happens particularly with a chrome cast. Infuriating."
2020-09-23 07:11:46,Freezes up,2,kteachretired,False,Almost every time it gets to a commercial it freezes up. Many times it stops casting. I do pay for the service but with commercials. I don’t mind the commercials but the constant freezing up is very annoying.
2020-08-02 16:16:19,No Picture-in-Picture on iOS,2,VaryingDegreesOfRight,False,"Along with the audio syncing, Airplay/casting, and video playback issues mentioned in other reviews, I have found that the app does not include the PIP feature on iOS devices. Unfortunately, this makes the app nearly unusable for me as someone with ADHD."
2020-09-20 13:27:52,Very disappointed with Premier League coverage,1,Cmlk04,False,Peacock is not doing what they could to provide coverage for games to American Premier League fans.  Why change things so drastically from NBC Sports gold?  That app worked well and provided great coverage. This is trash and the Premier League should consider what they are loosing out on here in the US with this poor streaming service.
2020-09-19 15:32:32,Can’t even open the app,1,No More Crashing Pls,False,I don’t know if it’s because the app developers at NBC forgot how that they needed the app to be compatible with iOS 14 or they just decided they didn’t want to but every time I open the app it immediately crashes. This happened when I was on the iOS 14 beta and on the completed public version.
2020-09-16 03:01:11,Beyond Greedy,1,kdoty21,False,"NBC is now taking the Premier League almost completely off of television and forcing viewers to pay an additional fee to watch what was free 6 months ago. They are doing everything they can to kill the sport in America and I desperately need ESPN to get the Premier League rights. No chance I pay for this subscription, I’ll just watch the games illegally."
2020-09-12 22:18:35,Worst streaming app ever,1,Honest Dionysus,True,"Constantly crashes!
I’d rather give myself a prostate exam with a pitchfork than try to watch a single episode on this terrible app!

Also your original content is perpetually butthurt libtard race pandering garbage - I run your trash on an apple iPad mini 3 - why does it crash - because I do not pay $ and subscribe for the privilege for your ideological indoctrination???"
2020-09-06 00:17:52,WORST APP EVER,1,wyntormoon,False,"So it says that you can stream and or watch on ANY Apple device. I’ve installed it, uninstalled and everything else. I sign up for it and keeps saying ERROR TRY AGAIN!! WHAT the HECK??? Won’t come up on my TV or Apple TV. Yes I have current iOS of everything. This is NOT Apple friendly and doesn’t seem like it’s supported by Dish either. Not going to get Xfinity just for this."
2020-08-17 00:32:18,buffer PIG,3,Silver.Band,False,"Great potential for this app/service. Won't give a dime until they work out the horrible buffering issues. Extremely frustrating.

Perhaps they should hire someone who know how to fix this major issue.........."
2020-07-24 01:51:22,Cannot screen mirror on other devices,2,Adam0623D,False,Peacock will screen mirror the 3 minutes of ads but once the show/movie starts it only shows a loading screen for the mirrored device while the original device will play the show/movie.
2020-09-21 20:14:27,No rewind or ff,2,lyricalvanilla,False,I used to be able to watch premier league matches from the start even if I got home late from work through my provider on NBCSN. They forced this app on me to watch my team and it’s virtually worthless to me to not be able to rewind to the beginning. Really awful from NBC
2020-07-17 04:29:49,Chromecast Needs Work,4,Prdflip1000,False,"Tried to put it up on my TV via Chromecast, but this functionality doesn’t work. Would be great if the Chromecast feature could work!"
2020-07-15 13:04:05,It blows!,1,KiraHarts,False,First of all too limited on devices no Roku please second Days of our lives and other programs have only select episodes and those are dated. Like 6 months or longer. I can get recent episodes on nbc. What a waste of time!!!I even bought the 4.99 subscription and still old episodes
2020-10-15 02:26:40,Terrible Excuse for an app,1,M1043,False,"Freezes and fails to stream to chromecast most of the time. When I did get it to cast, the app would freeze and the show would continue to play on the tv despite attempting to stop or enable CC on the app. Would have to force close then restart the app to be able to control it again. 

Sad."
2020-09-19 14:40:35,Disappointed,1,Junk rg,False,Cannot add the app through my big screen samsung smart tv.  That is a problem.  Also cannot send from a mobile device (iPad) to the TV.  My other streaming apps are all on my smart TV and I am also able to push to TV from a mobile device.  You need to get these capabilities corrected.
2020-09-17 03:28:12,Peacock not working for ios,1,Titotyy,False,I’ve been waiting for this app and once it got here never got a chance to use it crashes on my iPhone doesn’t matter if I’m at an older version or newer version of iOS won’t even open I’ve updated the app every time it updates but nothing has been fixed 👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻
2020-09-02 05:57:19,Awful,1,Matthewin702,False,"First of all, it’s only available on very few streaming devices. If you have an older Apple TV then you can forget about it. Secondly, the premium content should be separated from the free content to make browsing easier. Finally, stop being greedy and make it available on more devices."
2020-08-23 20:56:50,Old News,2,Gratia Countryman,False,"This is a terrible app for news. All of the clips are from broadcasts that aired weeks and months ago. I expect to see clips from the most recent broadcasts, and I expect to see them within 24 hours of the time they aired. Old news is garbage."
2020-07-24 19:19:14,Free?,2,Ej8705,False,If you want to watch certain shows you have to upgrade to premium which is $4.99. I was pretty much willing to use this app but not anymore cuz the shows I wanted to watch are not free to watch and i'm not willing to pay the fee for maybe one or two shows.
2020-08-20 02:07:19,Fire stick tv,4,Jlv43,False,"When will it be able for  the fire stick tv , I would definitely up grade too 4.99 a month r even 9.99 a month . I like it so far"
2020-08-08 22:24:04,So Many Bugs,1,ProfessorW,False,"I think it’s a great channel to have, especially for Psych, however the app it super buggy. I have to back out of the program constantly to restart and try to keep going. Plus the advance or rewind options are terrible and not easy to execute. (This goes for both the mobile versions and Apple TV.)"
2020-08-01 03:00:47,Will not load,3,SweetSouthernSass,False,After watching almost 6 episodes of one show i can not make it work for the last 4 episodes!! It stopped loading and nothing will help to make it work. Soo strange!!
2020-07-29 04:22:38,Great content!! Love it on my Apple TV and iPad!,5,Bluefishgaming,False,"Hey guys. I’m not sure what to say. This app works outstanding on my iPad and my Apple TV. Maybe don’t use a crappy chrome cast. 
Can’t wait for Battlestar Gallactica!"
2020-07-25 20:50:56,Casting,1,Cliff456987,False,"Can not cast from my iPhone to my tv! The show begins for just a second then a screen pops up saying’Ready to Cast’, but it does not. I don’t have this problem with any other app and when I try emailing them I get a message saying ‘ Opps a problem has occurred’ to try again so the message is never delivered. Very frustrating!"
2020-10-06 13:41:23,Limited app,2,Stretchxistence,False,"Peacock has some things that interest me from shows to watching EPL football games.  The only bad thing is you can’t cast , at least not to my Samsung TV.  The only way I can watch it is on my phone, or if I use the Xfinity flex box.  This greatly limits the options."
2020-07-19 05:49:24,Not currently functional,1,i need a unique username,False,"I wanted to watch a “Peacock” exclusive show. It streams just fine to my phone, but is currently unable to cast to my TV. Surprisingly incapable, this app appears to only be cognizant of advertisements and self promotion, without consideration of the consumer. It is generally not functional at this time, despite the fact that they’ve launched the app."
2020-07-15 12:02:44,Premier League!,5,Bwenner09,False,Having a way to watch all Premier League games without having to have cable and NBCGold! This is the greatest thing ever. Take my $10!
2020-07-15 07:52:12,Amazing,5,@Littleswagkid,False,This app is awesome. It’s easy to navigate. They shows are amazing. And how is this app free this is to good to be free. Keep working in this app to make it even better than before.
2020-10-18 14:58:04,Terrible for watching Premier League,1,Kjpaw,False,Watching the Premier League is terrible on the phone and TV app. It stops streaming all the time (today one of the 10 times it did this was right as Brighton was scoring). I had to close the app and reopen it 5 different times. Never had this problem with NBC Gold. It’s unacceptable for streaming live sports.
2020-09-05 00:52:03,Cannot stream to TV from a tablet or phone,2,The Kentuckian,False,"This app will not let you connect an iPhone or iPad to your TV to watch. Some shows only sound comes through and never any video. Some you get neither. 

It’s not always the best to watch on a smaller device."
2020-10-04 20:07:37,Great app,5,migz p;,False,Available on the Sony PlayStation 4 so you can stream on your tv as well. To be honest the content is decent. Great way to spend time.
2020-09-22 20:38:22,Horrible interface on Apple TV,1,KrispE00,False,"These streaming apps need to stop making their own interfaces. Peacock has no skip back or forward buttons, I can’t access closed captioning with my triple click menu button shortcut, and I can’t play/pause with the trackpad.
Just use the standard interface, please!!"
2020-09-20 15:32:46,Can’t even get premium,1,Jermain Williams,False,I was trying to watch the Chelsea vs Liverpool game today and I had purchased premium so I could watch it and it kept saying I have purchased premium but wouldn’t allow me to access the features of it. It ate $25 of my money and I didn’t get any plan besides the free one. Peacock is AWFUL and highly don’t recommend. LEARN HOW TO MAKE AN APP!
2020-09-19 17:33:03,Useless,1,Hocamania,False,"First attempt to use, won’t cast to my Apple TV or my fire stick so what can it do?  Oh awesome, I get to watch previously free Premier League games on my phone now.  Way to screw thongs up and get totally greedy, NBC.  Your app is a useless mess and you’re gonna lose all the goodwill you created over the last 5+ years to create football supporters in the US!!!"
2020-07-29 22:11:14,Audio doesn’t sync right when you Chromecast,3,stuckathome71,False,"Bought a new Chromecast because our old Chromecast is too old to work with Peacock, only to have the audio be out of sync. Really wish you could watch Peacock on Roku or Samsung smart TVs"
2020-09-05 00:32:25,Doesn’t Work,1,"Pancho, Ca",False,"Downloaded the app, attempted to create an account, I get a message to try again later. Tried again later, same thing. Deleted the app, re downloaded it again, attempted to create account, same message. Three strikes and I’m out, not exactly all that excited to try again, and I won’t."
2020-07-26 00:03:49,Inaccessible with voice over for dblind users and no audio discription,1,robjb90,False,Xfinity nbc universal normally price itself and accessibility for blind users and for usability in general. This app is very poorly designed with no search function and no audio description. The buttons are also not properly labeled when it comes to finding movies.
2020-07-15 17:08:45,Literally can't watch,2,Canus Miler,False,Lame. NBC. So so so lame. Pathetic ad set up where you can't stream this nice new platform via HDMI cable or Roku. Once they get over themselves and stop being the most selfish television company in history then maybe it'll be a good streaming option but for now it's a steaming pile of as revenue and incompatible viewings.
2020-07-19 01:22:28,Great for a new app,5,Deej-Bot,False,"Yeah, it doesn’t have all the features you want right away but for a new streaming app, it’s pretty awesome. Plus, it has all of Cheers!"
2020-07-28 05:16:12,"Great content, flaccid app",2,Rdubesq,False,"One of the very biggest corporations on planet earth and this is the best they can do. Laggy, buggy, wobbly.  An ad in the middle of a show (also, premium, why ad?) locks it up and gives a black screen that I have to fast forward past to jog the app to play the ad? Come ON!!!"
2020-07-15 03:18:07,Great friendly UI,5,Mohamed Shama,False,I am glad NBC/Universal took the needed time to release a stable and reliable app free from technical glitches so far.
2020-10-21 03:19:16,Not Bad At All,4,DealWithArctic,False,This app is pretty good... I enjoy being able to watch all the Harry Potter films. But I wish they included some anime in there but other than that outstanding app!

Ya gotta try it you won't be sorry you did 🤙"
2020-10-05 03:51:13,Greed.,1,thequeensea,False,"I detest the fact that some of my favorite shows are now riddled with commercials. I have to pay even more ON TOP of cable & internet fees to enjoy programs that I once did on Netflix. This was a greedy power money play. Disappointed. 

The app loads slowly. And you can’t create more than one profile. Do. Better."
2020-10-01 22:37:36,No way to watch on a TV,1,gfbookworm,False,"There is no app for Samsung TV and this app does not support airplay. It will play the sound on the TV but the video stays on the phone or tablet. Very annoying and makes this streaming useless for family TV. If you’re thinking about paying for a subscription, DON’T BOTHER! Until they add a Samsung app or Airplay it isn’t worth it."
2020-10-01 03:40:14,Terrible Apple TV app,1,Jay from Burbank,False,"The content is fine, but the Apple TV interface is the worst I’ve ever seen. Why can’t we skip forward or back 10 seconds like every other streaming service? If I miss a line of dialog and want to skip back, the app is so imprecise I usually end up having to rewatch the last 5 minutes."
2020-09-27 16:34:03,All my homies hate Peacock,1,Shmorgan1995,False,All I wanted as to stream soccer and Peacock has made that exponentially more annoying. Now I’m paying for cable and 3 streaming services through NBC just to watch EPL. Most useless app and can’t even access it on all my devices or plug my computer into the TV because it gets blocked. You lost all your trust with soccer fans NBC.
2020-09-19 13:02:17,Can’t use Xfinity login,1,LiveFreeRockHard,False,"I downloaded this app to my Apple TV but can’t use my Xfinity login information. I also can’t link my account, so even though I have Premier access with Xfinity, I have to pay for money per month to watch it on my Apple TV? And I can’t airplay from my phone to get around this? No thanks. Complete money grab."
2020-09-13 00:24:35,"SERIOUSLY HOW DO YOU WATCH REPLAYS and FOR PEAT SAKE, HIDE SPORT RESULTS",1,BruceHagan,False,"I open the app to watch a Premiere League match and what do I see, a large tile that tells me who won.  

Why pay to watch something via replay when they’ve spoiled the whole experience???

Next, I have yet to figure out how to watch a replay.  Has anyone that wrote this app even considered how difficult it is and why it must be difficult?

Please add a sports spoiler option.  

Please make it easy to watch replay. 

Please make it easy to figure out watch is being played on NBC Sports Gold and what is on Peacock.   

Oh, can you change the name to NBC All Access?"
2020-08-18 02:03:33,Doesn’t work outside US,1,skippybutz,False,"Would love to try but after i signed up and getting bombarded with email notifications for peacock programming , realized none if the peacock content is available outside the US. At least not for me. Cant believe even news shows which are viewable on the nbc or cnbc app arent viewable with this app. Disappointment."
2020-08-07 17:53:59,Harry Potter Streaming,4,Beast_Right,False,"Absolutely LOVE that the 8 Harry Potter movies will be coming out. It is in October though which leads to 4 stars, today is August 7. Wish they could be faster! Read online they’ll be in the free tier, hope so!!"

2020-07-30 19:15:27,far left leaning,1,wing commander 7,False,"If you Enjoy the alphabet channels abc, MSNBC , cbs, and left leaning ideologies, than this is the perfect application for you. I think they put the older movie and Tv content to attract traffic, but once you use the application you notice it’s really just away for the media to keep you focused on the left agenda on entertainment, politics. And thought."
2020-07-17 21:47:52,UX issues,3,Th funk,False,"The free content is really nice, but I’m having difficulty using the app. I’m not able to find my wish list item and I am not able to see all the available content in one area."

2020-07-17 06:38:55,Like it but one thing’s missing,4,burgess4,False,My only suggestion is that there needs to be a way to make a list of you favorites or “to-do” list.
2020-07-15 20:23:35,Why bother,2,autobodybuddy,False,Downloaded the app this morning to watch the English premier league and the app has already frozen 4 times even though the audio was still working. Only way to restore is to close out and reopen the app.  Really sucky when watching live sports.
2020-08-06 04:37:26,Keeps on bugging,2,Bobby The French,False,"I’ve never seen a streaming app so buggy, it’s really annoying. It crashes, or doesn’t resume after an ad, or the sound resumes but not the pictures, ...  it often resumes at the wrong place. In short: this app isn’t ready."
2020-09-28 22:37:38,An alright application,5,Anna the Mom,False,The app is decent. Most of the shows and movies available are free. Not much bugs encountered on my iPad.
2020-09-27 14:07:06,😡😡Peacock is an ugly bird😡😡,1,sruckel,True,"Who is writing 5 star reviews, NBC employees? This program is junk. It would not accept a paid subscription through the App Store. Deleted and tried 3 times. Canceled the subscriptions, deleted the app, tried to start over but wouldn’t take free sign up. And to make things worse, NBC took the Premier league games off NBCSN."
2020-09-13 03:53:17,Terrible for soccer,1,Hhgggfsrj,False,"The app is junk. It’s hard to find what you’re looking for, especially if it’s a Premier League game. Also, the premium service advertises that replays will be up by 9pm on match days, which so far is mostly a lie. Don’t pay for premium if you want to watch the EPL. They should have just kept the sports on the NBCSN app."
2020-09-11 22:15:33,Update.,5,K.ree,False,Update   I sent them my receipt and fixed it right away. Thank you.
2020-08-19 12:04:48,Crashes,1,Newsless II,False,"Another poor NBC app. Search is very slow and the app crashes when I try to access the episodes.  I added a few shows to the watchlist, how do I find the watchlist?

What the hell? App is not available on my Samsung TV, nor Apple TV app, when I do airplay from my phone - all is fine until a commercial...then it forgets its place and goes back like 30 mins and you cannot fix!!! Not restarting, reloading, deleting, during Bluetooth off....tried it all. Seriously NBC fix this crap!"
2020-07-17 13:01:22,Nice app but,2,marioguy25,False,It’s a nice app with good content but why is it only on certain devices I don’t understand why It can’t be on fire stick it’s only for Apple products come on now we can do better. It’s almost as if they are forcing you to get an Apple product just to get the app not cool.
2020-07-21 18:03:57,ADD FULL SCREEN VIEW,3,rflatt3,False,Please add the full screen view feature where we can watch our content on our phones where we can expand the view to cover the whole screen. Similar to how the Xfinity Stream app does it.

2020-09-27 20:14:25,Your UI needs more updating,2,Ska-triumph,False,"What is the point of the channels that are more random that ACTUAL channels? I mean I love SNL What’s Up Wit Dat sketches but geez!

Why have original programs if you’re not gonna feature them?'

Why have a watchlist that doesn’t go right to episodes to choose / watch?"
2020-07-16 08:56:59,Doesn’t even open,1,Jamal1003,False,"Just downloaded the app. Excited to give it a go- so I clicked open, and the peacock bubbles did their little dance... then froze and the app crashed. This has happened about 10 times now. After turning the iPhone off and on again, redone loading, etc. terrible."
2020-07-16 02:57:15,You must agree to marketing emails,1,Fat Tribble,False,"When you sign up and give them your email this disclaimer appears “By signing up you agree to receive occasional marketing messages from Peacock.”  While I’m fine with commercials or paying to get rid of them, I’m not subscribing to their email spam. Uninstalled."
2020-07-16 02:46:55,Pretty good,3,javajenni,False,Hopefully live tv and local news (kcra) will be available after trial period is over. Aside from that there are so many programs to watch. The video quality is excellent. The app is easy to use.
2020-07-18 18:26:21,Casting Issues,2,Identitherese,False,I have had this app for week and use chrome cast to watch on the tv. And it continues to kick out whatever I am watching usually 15-20 minutes in. It will go back to the “Ready to Cast” screen on the app. Which makes it not worth using for me.
2020-08-16 19:54:52,Can't Use,1,The explanations,False,"Every time I click the app, I get a few seconds of the loading screen and then it crashes. My friend has the app, and while it works, trying to get it to cast to the tv was near impossible. Was looking forward to free streaming :( Seems the platform needs some serious debugging."
2020-09-20 15:39:48,Fix Airplay to Apple TV video,2,franktenenbaum,False,Only reason I got this app was to watch PL because you had create another app from NBC sports. Im paying and can’t use a very important standard App streaming feature. What kind of customer experience is this?? Why is this not compatible with Apple TV AirPlay???
2020-07-15 16:35:50,Questionable Security,3,JohnMosesBrowning,False,Tried to sign up with a medium length complex password. App just says “illegal characters in password “ without saying which characters are “illegal “. Apps should accept passwords with all printable characters and at least 64 characters in length.
2020-10-05 13:14:49,Custom Video Controls Ruin This,1,MichaelMJ,False,"The Apple TV app playback controls are uselessly custom. Skip forward/backward is nonfunctional. When trying to scrub playback for a movie it is very difficult to control. When playing with AirPods in, taking one out paused the playback and I had to kill the app to get it playing again."
2020-09-25 11:42:39,Why?,2,Wastintime,False,Well NBC followed CBS’s idiotic idea and network TV started charging to watch what used to be free on their websites.  And there’s still ads!   Everyone’s just nickeling and diming you these days.  Rather pathetic when you realize how easily it could be free and they’d still generate ad revenue.
2020-09-19 17:28:24,Shocking avoid at all costs,1,chris124648373637,False,Making me have 2 subscriptions to watch 1 product? This is a joke... and starting the season without apps on Roku or fire stick and not sorting out making chrome cast work? Absolute trash can’t wait until another network buys the the rights so I can never watch nbc again
2020-09-19 14:13:44,They’ve made it so you can’t mirror,1,Kazankota,False,"For those of you who thought you would be able to mirror your iPhone to an AppleTV or other mirroring app, so you could at least watch it on a larger screen, they have purposely made this app unable to do so. As soon as any stream is opened it does not allow it."
2020-09-15 06:49:45,"No AirPlay on iOS App, locks in landscape mode",1,Kuraziekid,False,I can’t Airplay what I’m watching on the phone Peacock app to my Apple TV. The videos on the app do not have an airplay option. Please add. All I get played on my tv is the 41 second peacock promo on loop with no sound. Also please enable viewing in portrait mode or at least don’t lock it to landscape. Incredibly annoying.
2020-08-22 15:19:22,"Love the app, please support airplay",4,DoubleL,False,"On an iPad connected to a lightning to HDMI adapter, the app appears on the TV, but video only appears on the iPad and not the external TV. Other streaming apps work just fine, so please fix this."
2020-08-18 08:06:51,Ugh Really?,1,user468998776654224567890629,False,"There is a nice selection and all, but Peacock cuts out many scenes of different shows. It's so annoying. And it's not disturbing or innapropriate scenes, it's just regular parts of shows. Not to mention an insane amount of adds. I know there was going to be some adds, but not this much! This app can be highly irrigating!"
2020-07-23 21:10:16,Terrible,1,Gidgie Starr,False,Where are all the SNL episodes?  We get a lousy 5 out of 45 seasons and a “channel” that shows the same clips over and over. I am very disappointed. Even Seeso had all the episodes before you shut it down. I have never reviewed an app before today but this is the biggest disappointment ever.
2020-07-16 12:11:42,App not loading on open,1,Jfreeman28,False,The app is not loading past the second load dots. Your apps then freezes once. Tried to close and reopen and it's just a black screen no loading. I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling multiple times with the same outcome.
2020-07-16 02:05:50,Amazing App,5,Jesswsun,False,I’m so happy this exists! And the mobile experience is absolutely beautiful and unique. Love the channels and there is something for everyone.
2020-07-15 14:36:38,Ghost Adventures and Teen Wolf,3,Angelbearrr,False,"Please add all seasons of ghost adventures and teen wolf. You can never find seasons of those anywhere, you always have to buy them. Those two are my favorite shows I miss besides Heroes. Please bring them on here with all seasons"
2020-07-15 14:11:29,Wow!!! What a selection of shows... For free!!!,5,Mattstate,False,Amazing to think that this service is currently free! Can’t believe they have unsolved mysteries on here an the premiere league!! Thank you!!

2020-10-01 20:29:09,Best app,5,xbzbhebhsk,False,People may think this app is trash but in my opinion it is the best app ever for one reason only it has all 8 Harry Potter movies on it.
2020-08-01 21:10:33,Buggy,2,atlantis89,False,Midway through tends to jump back to the first section. Then you have to watch all the ads again to get back to where it was. First ad is in the first 3 minutes. Wish it was a little later.
2020-09-19 14:31:46,Absolutely crap,1,ksjaldmc,False,So so bad. NBC has us over a barrel when it comes to watch the premier league and they know it. Can’t pause or rewind live games. Replays are not available when they are supposed to be. The user interface is difficult to use and has load times when navigating the menus. Crap.
2020-09-19 14:24:02,Obsessed,5,vmahadanv2472,False,Loooove it so much it has all of my favorites it honestly couldn’t be any better!
2020-09-19 12:55:14,Can’t watch premier league,1,qfossing,False,The fact that I’m paying for nbcsn to watch the premier league and now have to pay for both nbcsn and peacock to watch my team play is evil. You guys are a bunch of money hungry pigs that do not care about the viewers which is why I’m switching to watching pirated streams instead of giving you my money
2020-09-18 03:05:13,Disappointed,1,Jules loves soccer,False,"The fact that there is no app for smart TVs is really not acceptable. Additionally, practically all EPL games are now on the app, which you need to pay for to watch. It used to be 2-3 games a day on the weekend. Now it’s just one a day?? I’m sucked into subscribing to this service because I love the game so much. I’m very disappointed."
2020-09-01 23:34:14,Great app,5,peterp416,False,Excellent choice for content otherwise not easily available. Well done.
2020-08-11 05:07:37,Worst Streaming Service EVER!,1,Dirt Thurston,False,We downloaded this app to watch a movie in our backyard only to discover that the Peacock app intentionally blocks you from watching through a projector. WHAT. THE. CRAP. Whoever made that decision hates their viewers and needs to be fired immediately. I will never support this app and will actively discourage everyone I know from using it as well. Garbage.
2020-10-03 17:01:50,Extremely Poor Search Functrion,2,chazubell,False,I tried to search for an actor in a movie that is currently on the service but it came up “could not be found”.  I would have give the app one star but the steaming works.
2020-07-26 00:23:28,Great app with one exception,4,WVDee,False,"When watching any video in the Peacock app, the white bar thingy at the bottom of my screen doesn’t go away. Please, make it go away. Thanks"
2020-07-23 20:50:16,Best,5,UG Amakar,False,Even tho i don’t have premium I think peacock is better than Tubi but I don’t know It’s all about the entertainment so peacock
2020-07-20 04:40:00,Free to watch?,4,legoman10088,False,Why advertise “Free to watch” yet we gotta pay monthly for extra features and more seasons/episodes for any show? 7 day free trial? Why not a month like regular steaming apps do?
2020-07-17 21:15:46,Not able to use iOS 13.6,1,kevin.mach,False,Saw that this app was released and was curious and downloaded it on the latest iOS 13.6 but when opening the it it shows the logo for a few seconds before crashing . I am using an iPhone SE 2. Can’t give a good rating when I can’t even access any content
2020-07-15 15:58:20,this is all FREE??,5,irefusetodomyonlinework,False,"still in Absolute shock that i don’t have to pay for any of this amazing content! love this service, what a lifesaver honestly!"
2020-10-17 20:01:19,only app that won’t connect to apple tv,1,Choma123,False,"I was forced to get this app because they bought the rights to half of the english league soccer games. No options for languages, cant scroll back if you’re watching live and I can’t watch it on my apple tv, I don’t even know why they’re editors choice."
2020-10-17 17:46:19,Poor streaming quality and lots of errors,1,omgthehumanatee,False,Have had the app a little over a week and it’s full of errors and poor streaming. Always choppy and constantly buffering. This isn’t a internet speed issue as all my other streaming apps work with no concerns.
2020-10-05 23:45:50,Absolutely Brutal,1,child genius,False,"This app is terrible. I have it on my iPhone XS and an iPad and it doesn’t work on either. Constantly freezes, doesn’t tell me what shoes or episodes I’ve recently watched, doesn’t pair well with chromecast.. the list goes on.

If Parks and Rec was still on Netflix I would’ve never switched. Please go back 😩"
2020-09-03 23:29:57,Very buggy,2,Ross C 1,False,"Sometimes jumps to the next episode before the current one is over. Sometimes drops to SD quality. Sometimes hangs for long pauses, repeatedly. Always acts unpredictably, e.g. sometimes auto plays next episode, other times simply ends."
2020-09-20 16:15:13,Horrible app,1,donghuffer,False,"Aweful, money hungry app.  Only allows 3 streams where as NBCsports gold was 5.  They are trying to promote this app so much that they are not showing huge EPL games on cable.  Also it glitches and boots you off. I have to resign into my account multiple times a day.  Horrible, horrible app and a total waste of $50 bucks"
2020-09-20 12:34:59,Clunky,1,ShaunItunes,False,"Its bad enough that they added Tim Howard but the app itself is terrible. Nbc had a great Epl team and coverage and all that is gone. 

I don't mind paying to watch a game. But games are hard to find because of the app layout. Then once it you find it the app crashes and crashes. 
  
How in 2020 does a app have no rewind of live games so when you tune in late you can go back and see the goals. 

Plus  No Picture in Picture in ios14 

Get it together or I will just do what others have suggested and find another way to watch."
2020-09-08 13:32:04,App doesn’t launch and error handling is terrible,1,Mercedes You,False,Downloaded so I could watch the Dan Patrick show. Tried to create an account and an error occurred with a message stating “try again later.” Should provide better error handling if it is not going to work. ‘Try again later’ is the kiss of death.
2020-08-10 07:18:54,App has bugs,2,mocki one,False,Tried to redownload app it will not and blocks itself this is just me trying to go to pay for the service I’m not sure there’s no info nor support to help fix it hopefully these things get resolved
2020-08-27 19:06:35,Getting away from a potential bad experience,1,Kasl2012,False,"I was getting ready to download this app, but after reading so many reviews,I will not. When I watch tv I want entertainment, not frustration. I’ll stick to Pluto tv. They are great, live content and an array of movies and tv shows to choose from."
2020-07-19 02:19:38,Needs work,2,carbearie,False,"We purchased Peacock for a number of the shows they were advertising. Unfortunately, the app will not cast to our TV (we’ve been seeing a number of other users support the same). Please fix this!"
2020-10-20 21:39:30,Audio no video when using Airplay,2,rodeoup88,False,"My other apps work using the airplay2 with my Samsung TV.  Peacock only has audio, the video doesn’t work.  I paid for a year and cannot even watch it on my TV.  Bad enough there isn’t an app for my TV."
2020-07-18 02:27:51,Not there yet,1,Jibbhy,False,"Doesn’t support AirPlay, also has loads of technical issues that most streaming apps would never have for optimal viewing experience. Peacock/NBC needs to get it together, rather than force themselves into the streaming space without considering what consumers truly need/want. Disappointed"
2020-07-15 12:57:28,Bad selection,1,Dwight Cade,False,I was very disappointed to see only current seasons of current shows to be on the app. The ads and commercials made it seem like I would be able to catch up on the seasons I missed and almost every show on their I can watch for free without ads anyway

2020-10-02 14:23:26,App needs work,2,Ohio housewife,False,"App is poor quality, when you take out AirPods  instead pausing the video it switches to playing with using the speaker. Poor choice of development. I looked for settings to adjust but those didn’t exist."
2020-10-15 00:39:07,Play in background,3,Dokule,False,"The service is great, but the player in the app needs to be Allowed to play in the background and download videos for offline play"
2020-09-07 04:04:12,Sound Quality Awful,2,troubleshooting chick,False,Sound/ volume is constantly changing loud to low on shows and commercials. Get it together ! None of my others apps do this . Hope there is a fix in the works . Using Apple TV
2020-09-19 22:42:05,Limited streaming,1,barrymartina,False,"Signed up for premium mainly for Premier League matches.  App is not available for Firestick or Roku though, and unable to cast onto TV so limited to watching on an iPhone.  I changed from an older Apple TV to Firestick after NBC Gold transferred to NBC Sports App, as there was no app for the Apple TV.  Very frustrating.  Will likely cancel subscription."
2020-07-18 16:18:54,Super Laggy,2,DummyO,False,"Super laggy service. Tried multiple show. It’s not my connection as all other streaming services are great! Conveniently the commercials were fine. 

Also, don’t appreciate the bait-and-switch tactics by not showing a premium flag on “free first episodes”."
2020-08-25 04:04:46,"SCAM of a 7-Day free trial, deceptive in general",1,GrumpyTurnip,False,"Charged a day before free trial was up.  Emails from apple confirms this.  Currently waiting for refund.

Also when I had used the app many of the shows had 1-3 episodes truly free after those the premium plan is needed.  So deception all around.  This app is now permanently deleted off my devices."
2020-08-23 14:53:46,So many options!,5,Danielosophy,False,Can you make it available on Roku?
2020-08-13 02:11:06,AWESOME APP!👍🏼,5,imfantastic19,False,"I really like the show Get out of my Room, and thy have all the episodes for free. They also have a lot of Curious George episodes, and American Girls movies. I give it 5 stars!⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️"
2020-08-12 07:25:03,Premium and Premium Plus DON’T WORK,1,Gisha808,False,Not worth the frustration!!  NBC needs to put their content on apps that work and stop wasting our time.  Paid for the upgrade to watch new shows but app doesn’t register that I bought upgrade.  Impossible to watch any new shows.  Peacock need to fix this!
2020-07-25 01:57:53,Facepalm,1,DeafAngelboy23,False,It’s literally impossible to get rid of stupid white swipe up during the viewing. It don’t disappear during playing just like other streaming apps such as Netflix. If they would try to fix this annoying feature then I’ll re-consider using it again.
2020-07-21 19:36:40,This is so far off from being the best,1,gtw145,False,"Listed as a top app 
Read the reviews 
Nobody has had a good experience with this app but Apple thinks we love!!
Not free $4.99 a month for premium or $9.99 for premium plus 
Audio is in low quality 
Picture is in Standard Definition 
Sub titles out of sync 
Commercial ads even during movies that you cannot skip 

I bet the prices change in 6 months to over $50 bucks 
It is a lot cheaper than cable 
Screencast works good !

My Nvidia shield get all the stuff on this app for free !
Pluto TV has more content and no charge"
2020-10-20 15:05:02,"Bugs, lots of bugs",2,Crimeguy,False,I love the programming but I constantly have to delete and reload the app due to it freezes up or you can hear in background but no video.  Please fix these issues.
2020-07-17 03:02:07,"no spanish dubs like netflix, disney plus, or apple tv +",1,Struthionidae,False,"Hoped they would have spanish language dubbing on their shows like competitors. I would be happy to subscribe if they had some shows with spanish dubbing.....but after checking 20-30 shows and none having alternate language tracks, i gave up."
2020-07-15 16:39:58,Poor playback controls,3,Human9503,False,No pause. Videos start playing while you are searching or browsing. Very annoying.
2020-10-04 13:45:31,Can’t rewind with Apple TV,2,AnneliseD123,False,"This is pretty disappointing. I can’t rewind using the Apple TV remote. Apparently the only way to rewind on the Apple TV is to use the app on an iPhone. I understand why NBC is taking their shows back, but please please please fix this problem."
2020-10-19 03:06:43,"App too buggy, doesn’t allow continuous play of content, layout too crowded",1,Bibby Hill,False,"Needs a UX/UI overhaul.  That said, love the original programming (AP Bio & Amber Ruffin ❤️), SNL vault, and Hitchcock movies — hopefully some of these archives can be expanded.  As is, the functionality of the app does a huge disservice to the quality and breadth of programming coming from NBC / Universal."
2020-10-04 12:31:35,Won’t allow connection to TV,1,Watch espn,False,"One star due to app will not allow hdmi/lightening connector to push image to TV. Freezes immediately when show/game starts. Other than that context, image, streaming is good on device but should have ability to play to a TV like all other apps."
2020-10-03 14:55:53,This is 2020,1,Roxy1012,False,"If you like being caught in an endless cycle of a Bot providing you bad service, an unorganized structure, and unclear directory this is the app for you. Signed up to watch Premier League, but finding the available games is similar to attempting to find a long lost treasure. NBC, quality is more important than speed."
2020-09-20 22:40:13,Forced subscriber,1,koptomist,False,"I wasn’t really interested in being a peacock subscriber, but, I was forced into it by NBC putting some of the biggest premier league games on premium only. To add insult to injury, the app is not even supported on my streaming service, so I am watching games on my computer. Shame on you during an, already, stressful 2020."
2020-09-20 16:51:35,Ruined Premier League.,1,Ruined Premier League,False,"This app does not work properly. If it did I would be willing to pay for Premier League but it doesn’t and is not worth the money. Premier League morning show and games are hard to find. No rewind, fast forward. A poorly designed money grab not worth the ransom money to watch Premier League."
2020-09-19 16:00:38,App freezes and goes in and out,2,Dwl82,False,Downloaded today for Premier league..... constant lockup’s..... video quality goes in and out from fuzzy to crisp. Seems ok once going I wish it wasn’t so buggy! All my other streaming apps work fine.
2020-09-18 00:51:13,Doesn’t work on iPads,2,Melizbe,False,"This app works fine on my Apple TV, but when I try to use on my iPad it keeps saying there’s no internet connection, which isn’t true. Not sure it’s worth the money if I can’t watch on all my devices."
2020-09-19 13:44:19,EPL promises broken again,1,JJB11118,False,Once again American fans get to be disappointed with how we are taken for a ride to see games. For shame NBC. You have a choice to provide access to a worldwide fan base and you continue to choose to cater only to those who can afford top tier access. Way to miss the 2020 memo.
2020-07-29 04:28:05,Clunky,2,Chiefpoko,False,The home line indicator on iPhone X is always visible which is super annoying and obtrusive especially when watching a dark show. Nothing like a bright white line to ruin the mood. Hopefully they get this fixed soon.
2020-08-30 14:33:49,No AirPlay option is a joke,1,Danny Pancratz,False,"It’s been a month and there’s no AirPlay option on iOS. I can understand if they’re not going to support older Apple TV devices, but then to not have AirPlay is a big miss. In a time of people staying at home, you have to provide options to watch in their TVs."
2020-07-19 18:30:07,Ehhhh,2,ppigglett,False,Constantly buffers so it takes twice as long to get through watching nothing. I jumped in and signed up for the $4.99/mo plan but think I’ll cancel after the free week trial.  Would sign up again if the buffering issue is resolved.
2020-10-19 03:41:30,No full screen or zoom on iPhone,2,Miubears,False,"No full screen option on iPhones. Movies on my 11pro look tiny with black bars on top, bottom and both sides. This should be a basic feature in all video apps."
2020-07-17 22:00:41,Has potential...,1,C. Nik Scat,False,"The content and price point is good. But have two days of multiple downloads, still can’t get my brand new chromecast to work...You really expect me to spend hours consuming content on my phone when so many other apps/services let me connect to my TV?!"
2020-07-17 19:28:41,Glitches,3,Gym-craze,False,"I tried watching Jurassic Park (an old favorite) the vocals did not match what the actors were saying, and the commercial breaks are sloppy. The screen froze on the movie, and I heard the commercial before appeared on the screen."
2020-07-15 17:12:29,Needs User Profiles and air dates of shows!,3,JungleSports,False,"Not bad... but desperately needs user profiles!!! I also like to see the air dates of all the programming if it is a tv show, or the release date if it is a movie. 
Please add these!"
2020-07-15 03:51:55,New streaming app!,5,Doris__T.,False,Great new streaming app that offers great variety. Can’t wait for them to get on Roku so I can watch from my tv!!
2020-10-20 05:50:02,Love,5,dulceromerooodulce,False,I love it so much totally recommend i love watching movies and show it has so many movies and shows ❤️love
2020-10-07 17:32:56,Paying for Commeericals,2,mikaelalopez2013,False,"I paid for the monthly subscription, yet still watching commercials that last over 5 minutes. The ideal beginning paying it to not see commercials."
2020-10-10 23:41:56,I can only watch this from my cable box,1,Quajas,False,"I have the app on my iPhone, but I have repeatedly tried to sign up and it tells me that there is a problem every time. Unfortunately I can’t take my tv with me “on the go”. The app is useless if you can’t sign up to watch."
2020-10-07 02:22:30,Why?,2,abundancies,False,"Ever since the newest iOS, parts of my drop down bar appear on the side of the screen when watching shows. When I force quit the app, it goes away. I’ve only ever seen this problem on this app :/"
2020-10-06 01:01:22,great until i couldn’t watch anything,3,Yassie :-),False,it was fine for SVU until they added that “premium” crap. now i can’t watch it. the ads weren’t enough?
2020-10-06 16:39:02,Apple TV app needs work,1,Floris394,False,"After signing up it took until the next day for streams to actually play instead of doing nothing, not even a warning.

It’s also practically impossible to skip forward or backward because they use non standard controls that make you skip minutes at a time.

New bug: every time you want to continue a series you’re watching it just restarts the last episode you watched.

And I’m not sure if this is under your control but why are swear words bleeped out? What am I, 12 yo?"
2020-09-24 13:01:34,missing a key basic feature,3,scrap0346,False,"so far, works ok, as long you don’t need to fast forward or rewind on the apple tv. there’s no back 15 seconds or anything functionally similar. you have to swipe, and it’s basically a lottery. am i going back 5 seconds or 5 years? who knows. better off just starting the show completely over which means more ad play for them—funny how that works out"
2020-09-26 16:35:39,Impossible to navigate,1,nsjtmaffl,False,"You can only search from one page, there should just be a search bar no matter where you are.  Also, the only reason people have this app is premier league soccer, and get every game is impossible to find."
2020-09-21 21:02:27,It does not make sense (Premier League),1,Ari-Fett,False,"They payed all that money for the TV rights just to hide so much of the content behind an absurd paywall. It's so corporate and tone deaf especially during these times. When watching sports is at its highest demand while people are stuck at home, lets charge everyone extra."
2020-09-15 05:40:20,So many bugs.,2,CG7204,False,Good shows but the app keeps locking up and shows keep freezing. Scrolling through shows can be painful as the screen is sensitive and selects random episodes as you scroll.
2020-08-23 09:57:09,App crashes every commercial,2,IAMcLovin,False,"It’s annoying that every time a commercial plays, the app crashes, I have to exit out & back in & it doesn’t always pick up where it left off."
2020-07-22 21:25:08,Turn off auto-play,2,eddie 72,False,"Please include an option to turn off auto-play.  Also, like the other streaming services, there should be an option to always show cc (closed captions)."
2020-08-22 04:44:30,Great app! CJC Network,5,Carl Ja,False,I love the app. I just wish they would get TheGrid Network then I can get rid of my SelectTV app and watch everything on Peacock.
2020-08-16 00:27:20,MONSTER HIGH,5,ITZ AnimeGoldenKat,False,"I love this app because there’s monster high monster high is my favorite monster high monster high monster high monster high IFBTHEY GET RIG OF MONSTER HIGH IW WILL MAKE SURE THE GO DOWN

2020-07-23 23:24:20,App will not open,3,Gokart2356,False,I’m sure this is a good app but it basically crashes upon launch on my iPhone XS. After the latest update it still does the same thing.
2020-07-15 17:56:52,It’s okay,2,khilton25,False,"I’m okay with some of the stuff, but it advertises as a free streaming network. When it’s not that at all. i understand that $5 a month is not a lot but don’t advertise as free then try to charge me when i go to watch a season 2. Fix how you advertise this app."
2020-07-21 01:03:12,Ok - needs improvement,3,Dennisccook,False,This is a good app but when you try to cast to Google Chromecast there is an audio lag often. Willing to make this five stars if this gets updated.
2020-09-19 14:00:35,Apple TV + HomePod issues,2,dbvoegtle,False,"If you’re like me and your output your Apple TV audio to a HomePod pair don’t expect this app to work consistently. I can occasionally get it to do so, but it requires multiple tries (dozens, not a couple). Not ready for prime time for a premium television experience."
2020-07-15 15:38:16,New and Exciting,5,Catgamer242,False,This is a new platform that is free and really fun to use! I would recommend getting this!
2020-07-15 08:35:14,Idk,4,dbest87,False,"I was soo excited to watch all seasons of bgc but they only have seasons 13,14,15,16,17 🙄soo there for iam hurt and disrespected by peacock because they even said “all 17 seasons will be streaming on peacock “ and no theres only 5 seasons and not even good seasons 🙄"
2020-10-19 02:04:37,Sign in,1,maromero3015,False,"My wife and I have both tried several times to set up an account and keep getting an error. We have tried on multiple devices and keep getting an error occurred, try again later. I'm done trying. Deleted this app."
2020-10-09 03:54:13,Amazing App,5,ayla_sayd16,False,You can get so many movie and tv shows for FREE! Definitely recommend!
2020-10-05 05:17:31,Loaded my show once and never again.,1,Bsjxndhd,False,I’ve attempted to watch Harry Potter for over 30 minutes now. It doesn’t load and you can’t say it’s my internet because it is 200+mbps. It is a shame that this service doesn’t work. It would be good otherwise.
2020-09-26 23:08:57,No pip,3,jake from state farm 42069,False,I use this because parks and recreation is being taken off of Netflix but I like using my phone for other things while I watch it and I can’t do that with this app please add pip
2020-08-22 04:37:59,Good but...,2,Tangerineflamingo2,False,"I like the selection of the shows, however I cannot get it to work on my Apple TV.  It works fine on my phone but will not let me mirror the screen to the Apple TV or sign in.  If it were not for that, I would rate higher."
2020-09-13 03:26:56,Pass word never works,1,Cool YiaYia,False,Can’t watch anything tried signing so many time s it’s a joke. Your pass word does not match so they sent me a email to reset a new pass word. So I did. Signed in again there is a problem try again. This is a waste of my time. I’m deleting the app and emails.
2020-08-09 07:29:43,Auto Play,3,Kelcoppage,False,I love the app and the shows available but I primarily use chrome cast to watch it and there is no auto play nor an option to enable it. Please give us auto play!!!
2020-07-26 22:24:01,Ok app but,3,Wolfbrian2,False,The service is good but the UI for the Apple TV is utter crap! Trying to navigate just a few seconds requires multiple steps. Please allow the 10 second skip on the Apple TV remote.
2020-07-30 23:17:51,Not worth the $$,1,JPISME,False,Not at all what I expected. Many of the shows that were advertised pre-launch are not current and are old seasons. Anything current is something I could have watched on my TV anyway. Such a disappointment and I will not be renewing my subscription.
2020-07-25 05:26:13,I can't watch the premier league,2,kelmonice,False,I pay for the premium and the reason why is because I lik soccer they u can watch the premier league that was the reason I pay for the premium when game are on can't even find live section

2020-07-19 19:37:06,Crashes Upon Opening,1,Hopper202,False,I’ve re downloaded the app several times and it continues to crash about three seconds after opening it. Nothing has loaded it just opens with a black screen and peacock logo then crashes. Hopefully this will be patched with an update. iPhone XR
2020-07-15 11:50:02,NO STREAMING TO DEVICES,1,Fob Rord,False,"Talk about crappy, you wait 3 years for a movie and it has to be on this stupid app. Not only does the app not cast to any devices when streaming, you also cannot use peacock tv to play on even a web browser?! So glad I waited til today for real free instead of getting one of the paid plans!"
2020-10-13 03:09:01,No Air play available,3,ANicknameNow,False,Please update the interface and functionality to allow for airplay. I would like to stream from my phone to Apple TV.
2020-10-10 03:19:29,App shuts off,1,Patz12345,False,I’ve been having constant issues with the app. It will stop playing after about 7 mins and will make me watch ads every time I restart the same episode I’ve been trying to finish for over an hour...

2020-09-27 05:06:29,Desperately needs jog controls on AppleTV,1,Zodiacrat,False,Every other streaming app will jog forward or back 10-15 seconds by pressing either side of the remote. As far as I can tell Peacock doesn’t support this feature. Really annoying if you miss something or want to skip ahead.
2020-09-22 17:33:56,Awful and money grabbing losers,1,Olddbray,False,"It’s one thing to rob your already paying customers from previous years. It’s another to do it with a pathetic product that fails and doesn’t stream at all. Weak effort to grab more money in the USA by NBC sports, shameful and worse pathetic. Did they do any testing whatsoever?"
2020-09-22 05:01:18,Looking forward to future updates,5,Not Ignorant,False,"Really enjoying the app so far and loving the content!

I know you all work really hard on this app, so please keep up the hard work!

One thing I would really love is Picture in Picture capability. Is that in the pipeline for a near-future update?

Thanks!"
2020-09-19 16:31:20,Gold was bad. This is worse,1,dnicenapster,False,Come on NBC. This is going to kill soccer in America. Putting this many matches behind a paywall is a huge mistake. Also no Airplay and no ability to split screen on iPad is a joke. At least offer the same features that Gold had. Very disappointed.
2020-09-17 21:26:17,The App doesn’t work,1,Jstan51,False,I get errors every time I log in. I try to create a new account and get errors then. I try to reset my password and never get an email. I’m sure the app works great. I’ve just never been able to use it which seems like an important feature.
2020-09-16 13:18:30,Give me all the Law and Order,3,jmemaybe,False,I’d give five stars easy if they’d put all the seasons of Law and Order on Peacock. They only have 13 and up. Ridiculous. Shouldn’t this be the app that has them all???
2020-09-15 01:01:48,commercials > user experience,1,Cosmicnaut,False,"The irony of bragging about sponsors paying for “limited commercials” & then ruin shows with commercial breaks that cut into the middle of random dramatic moments throughout shows. Billions of dollars, decades in the biz, & these morons can’t get commercial breaks right... sad. I’ll just wait for these shows to hit netflix..."
2020-09-13 15:30:59,Can’t use on Samsung TVs nor can you AirPlay to Samsung,1,Deavs10,False,This app is useless to me if I can’t watch it from the TVs in the house and I shouldn’t have to buy an adapter.  Every other competitor is at least able to do this. Very disappoint that I’ll have to watch the EPL from my iPad. I guess I can have the Bundesliga up on the TV then.
2020-08-18 10:28:40,I Agree. One of the Worst Apps I’ve ever dealt with,2,klscribe,False,"Which is really disappointing and perplexing because we’ve come so far and there are so many great streaming services out there, this feels like going 20 years in the wrong direction. C’mon, guys.  Fix your app"
2020-09-16 00:11:23,Why,2,Fix this 1,False,"This make noSense. Every other streaming program you can watch on your phone or your television or your iPad or wherever. NOPE, not this one! Only on your phone or your iPad I feel like I’m back in 2000. Get it together guys streaming mean streaming"
2020-08-14 02:36:55,Needs picture in Picture,3,leveler9,False,I think this app should have picture in picture feature
2020-07-15 14:39:30,Accessibility is horrible,1,Dahlia8418,False,If you’re going to make a good app please make sure that you make it accessible for others. There is no reading on the labels meaning I can’t even see what the heck is coming on unless it’s on the watchlist. Fix it please! Make sure you have voiceover testers to make this happen!
2020-10-03 16:05:59,Very disappointed,1,Spinn<33,False,this app needs a lot of work . Too many glitches. episodes sometimes take forever to even play. It has a decent library of shows and movies but the app itself is not as great as they advertised it to be.
2020-08-01 03:28:44,Unfinished,2,monstawansta,False,"Streaming to chrome cast from iOS is broken, get blank screen only. Apple TV streaming also broken, you need to do screen mirroring but only audio works. However, the ads somehow stream flawlessly."
2020-09-13 18:12:04,Premier League,1,17392629:,False,Terrible App for the Premier League. Unable to view the premier league game or rewind it to the beginning. Splitting the Premier League games between this app and their sports network seems like a blatant attempt to make you pay for two subscription services. What a huge disappointment for this season.
2020-08-14 04:09:42,Not allowed to mirror...,1,bummed40,False,I downloaded this app planning to use my phone to mirror-but it won’t let me. Except it will mirror the ads??!! I’m getting rid of it until they’re willing to change it and I’ll be sticking to Disney+ and Netflix even though I have to pay for these services.
2020-07-15 17:41:42,Crashes on Ipad Air,2,Jed566,False,App description says this works on IOS 11 and up but my Ipad Air on 12.4.8 doesn't get past startup screen. I have tried restarting my Ipad to no avail. Works fine on my phone but I would rather not watch TV on my phone.
2020-07-23 22:28:47,Searched Episodic Content Feature Broken,1,~Sylph~,False,The application crashes every time you attempt to watch any specific episode of searched content. (iPad) This is so frustrating that it completely ruins the application for me. What use is content if you cannot view it?
2020-07-20 02:06:34,"Good idea, terrible apple tv app",1,1nyc1,False,"Too many technical issues with this app. Did these people not their app before releasing it??? 🤦‍♂️ App keeps crashing after a few minutes. Also, content is very similar to Pluto TV which is also free - I see no value at the moment to download Peacock 👎"
2020-08-14 17:31:21,Poor,2,t99dalt,False,"Real problems with mirroring. No problem steaming news clips, movies, or commercials. However, while I see the content fine on the device, all I can get on live or programmed TV is audio, presumably buffering."
2020-07-15 16:41:39,Will Not Stream to Chromecast on iPhone,1,igtifivjfiriv,False,Just downloaded app & it will not connect to chromecast. It clocks for a few minutes before ultimately disconnecting. I tried multiple other apps & they all connected & streamed just fine so I can only assume the issue is with this app & its compatibility with iOS &/or chromecast.
2020-07-15 16:10:42,Missing Watch List Button,3,KsJayhawksfan,False,Button to access Watchlist is missing. Unable to just view the items I have added to my Watchlist.

2020-09-28 15:40:06,Can’t beat free,4,markbyrn,False,"There is little to no new content that I’m interested but as there’s a handful of classic TV shows, it’s worth the low cost of free as long as it stays free."
2020-09-28 01:58:54,Soccer hostage,3,Ya kiwi,False,"I downloaded this app and bought Premium membership for the English Premier League games that they are hiding from the NBCSN audience. 

   NBC buys more sports rights than they can handle, and now they are pimping their precious purchases, declaring Peacock as the “home of the EPL”. 

I can’t record Peacock games, and if I miss the one I want, I am on the pimp’s timetable for replay.

The rest of their material isn’t worth the hype. I get more voluminous options on free streaming apps."
2020-09-20 02:38:02,Completely Useless - complete money grab,1,Coopaloopiv,False,“Would you like to pay twice for games/shows that you already pay for with your cable subscription? Great! Pay for Peacock and we’ll show you MORE commercials. Oh and the quality will be terrible.”
2020-09-17 21:31:11,DONT SUBSCRIBE,1,i real reviews I,False,This is a greedy and the worst move made by comcast. So they want to pay for a subscription to watch a game when we’re already subscribed to cable provider? What a worthless selfish inconsiderate company it is I hope it goes bankrupt and burn to the ground then you start giving us content.
2020-09-13 16:22:52,Terrible for football,1,coach chambers,False,I’m trying to watch a football match and the app keeps loading every 30seconds. The picture is often grainy. Also the app isn’t playing the halftime coverage and commercials. I wouldn’t recommend this to anyone!
2020-08-20 03:20:47,Love it but need to be able to mirror it,4,fjcjens,False,This app is great! But it’ll be even better with the ability to screen mirror it with any tv
2020-08-17 00:54:55,iPhone screen mirroring doesn’t work,1,Llacey42,False,It appears that the app doesn’t support screen mirroring with iPhone. I googled the issue and there are many threads out there verifying this. It’s a shame because it’s a decent app and I like the shows....but I want to watch on a bigger screen.
2020-08-16 21:58:02,App keeps crashing,4,frostyfoss,False,So when I try to open this app it crashes. I like the app but it keeps crashing

Minutes and unable to disconnect or reconnect. Only
App to have this problem. Frustrating, most likely going to delete it if not fixed soon."

2020-08-09 19:16:44,Horrible,1,Teacher2014hb31,False,"Unless you are ready to watch shows on your iPad or phones, it’s not worth the download. This app refuses to connect to chromecast to play on the tv. We’ve tried everything! It’s not rocket science to click the button but nothing happens. Waste of time! Don’t download!"
2020-07-23 20:55:42,not a hit,2,mmmcheeseburgers,False,"easily one of the worst steaming apps i’ve used. 

for example - 

so far i’ve had to restart this same episode 3 times. all of a sudden it jumps to the ready to cast screen for no reason. and every time i have to restart the subtitles.  which by the way are spoilers as the next statement shows up in print before it’s said if there is a long pause after what was just said. nbd but still annoying. oh and if the show has subtitles something you may have missed the app subtitles will cover that, but won’t include it so you’ll miss that statement completely.  again. nbd but really annoying and distracting.  and i’m only trying to watch below deck ffs. 

if paying for this app is the only fix for the steaming quality issue, i’d say not worth it."
2020-10-03 12:23:32,Paying for this,2,Dustin Hadley,False,"NBC makes us once again change applications, pay for a new subscription, simply to watch premier league soccer, and you can’t create the simple tool to stream it to my TV"
2020-07-23 16:46:05,Out of sync audio on Chromecast,3,btanonbt,False,App works great on phone but audio goes out of sync when using Chromecast. Restarting the stream fixes this temporarily but it will keep falling out of sync. Please fix!
2020-07-15 20:49:55,Pathetic - Long delay in casting Live Sports,1,Kash-yap,False,"Tried to watch the Premier League game live and there is a 5 minute difference between casting to TV and watching on the phone. It’s like watching highlights when the game is on Live! Imagine that!!! 
I expect an established company like NBC to make an app that can cast well. In this age, casting to TV is basic."
2020-07-15 17:27:57,Amazing,5,juan muro,False,I finally have a place to watch premier league matches for FREE!!! Amazing app can’t wait to see what happens in the future.
2020-07-15 03:20:58,Obsessed,5,redaf1449,False,The layout is amazing and all my favorite shows and movies are on here. Thank you peacock!!!!!!
2020-08-30 21:47:37,Needs Work,2,Starski81,False,The interface is not great and needs a lot of updating. Also it buffers frequently when it’s time for an ad. I would not recommend this app in its current state.
2020-10-01 21:54:52,Terrible streaming app,1,Mikeyarg,False,"Good streaming service, but the app is missing many features like picture and picture mode. It's really annoying that my show pauses everytime I have to reply to a text message. And when it resume the playback studders."

2020-09-28 21:56:07,"Horrible App, Decent Streaming Service",1,BlakeEllzy,False,The app lacks many features that seemingly have been standard for 10+ years. It doesn’t even offer play/pause buttons for live tv or the ability to cast to a device. By far the worst streaming app on the App Store.
2020-09-19 14:13:12,BOYCOTT PEACOCK,1,Drshsjsj,False,If you’re trying to watch Premier League you should boycott this service and find another way. You can’t record matched and Match replays aren’t available until 9 hours after the match! NBC really butchered this. Probably the worst streaming service available right now.
2020-09-18 21:30:33,Why am I paying for NBC through cable?,1,frylock42,False,"They just took all of their decent content from NBCSports and threw it behind a paywall with a poor app.
There is now nothing on NBC I want to watch, but I am still forced to buy it though cable and now this extra.

No way. Too much of a money grab."
2020-09-17 21:01:38,Paywall for premier league,1,mrsadandabused,False,"I pay for cable to get the premier league on NBCSN, now they’ve decided to move it all to peacock. Not only is it an extra charge, it isn’t even available on Roku! This is a disgrace of a streaming service and should be shut down for a more competent replacement."
2020-08-07 17:54:55,There is nothing to watch,2,Big Max 1,False,"How many times can I watch the same shows over and over again?  There are all  old re-runs, nothing new, creative or exciting."
2020-07-31 04:15:24,No audio only,3,andyspocket,False,"All the other stealing apps allow user to lock phone, and then hit play to lists to the program audio only. Great for bedtime. 

Peacock does not. Bummer"
2020-07-26 09:13:30,Disappointed MSNBC Fan,1,MrPBS,False,"I’m disappointed that there aren’t complete shows under the News tab. Only short, undated clips. It would be great if you could add the last four or five episodes of your news shows, and please date them. Thanks in advance."

2020-07-24 01:06:19,Awesome!,5,YeeYeeEveryday,False,I love the concept of “mostly free streaming” and peacock does this in an amazing way.  Not trying it out would be a waste - it’s free!
2020-07-17 01:06:23,Peacock,2,Jaiden Morris,False,"They heavily advertise this streaming service as free, which is true to a certain extent but not entirely. Shows and movies go away after a few weeks and some content you can’t even watch without premium."
2020-07-21 18:06:30,Not available ANYWHERE yet.,1,aksarge75,False,I have a brand new high end Samsung smartTV... I subscribe to all of the streaming services... I have top tier Spectrum broadband internet/cable service... and yet for whatever BS reason Peacock is not offered here in my STL market — are you serious?!?! What the hell guys??!!

2020-07-15 15:03:02,Just awful,2,Stubblefish,False,"This app is fine for browsing on-demand content, but their “live channels” streams are terrible. No way to pause (or mute) the feed on the default channel while you’re looking through the list of other channels?!?"
2020-07-16 12:30:15,Good start,4,Soc Prof,False,"There’s a lot of great NBC content here but there needs to be a live local channel, like CBS All Access offers. The price (free) is right though!"
2020-07-16 10:55:28,Wow,5,jfkdjdkrmekdid,False,I really can’t believe that a  app with a truck load of tv shows is free. Honestly unbelievable!
2020-07-16 03:48:01,Its not free..,3,manojjain126,False,Its not free ... just a marketing gimmick...Others streaming services give you free trial ..peacock gives free episodes.. I thought its like TubiTv .. not quite so. But explore and decide ... is the content really worth 5 bucks per month..
2020-07-16 01:16:26,Samsung Smart TV’s,3,TRIFLY22,False,Will this app be available soon for Samsung Smart Flat Screens ?  I would rather watch TV on my 55” flat screen as opposed to my iPhone.  Hope you guys make this available to to Samsung Smart TV’s soon !!!!
2020-07-15 23:07:26,Doesn’t work on Chromecast,1,Steve287)9976544,False,"iOS App won’t cast to my Chromecast. The cast icon just keeps showing that it’s trying to cast for about a minute and then stops. All of my other apps (like HBO Max) work fine, so it’s not the Chromecast, it’s the app. Tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app and it still doesn’t work."
2020-07-15 17:41:19,False advertising...,1,wil050671,False,"Advertises itself as completely free but it is not. You get random episodes of random shows here and there free, but everything else you have to pay 5 bucks a month for. It’s not expensive, but don’t advertise to be something you’re not..."
2020-10-10 19:16:05,Love it but wish it was on Samsung tv,3,𝓙𝓮𝓷𓆉,False,I really love this app I can watch all my favorite movies for free but I just wish it was on Samsung tv so I didn’t just have to watch it on my phone

2020-10-18 11:57:29,Putting EPL matches on a paywall is bush league,1,VoteForKanye,False,"It’s the early morning on 10/18. Instead of showing the match on TV (NBCSN), it’s behind this slow app with over a minute DELAY of actual results. How do I know this? Because any human can follow live feeds such as Twitter. 

So the app is slow. The app UI is terrible. The paywall is abhorrent."
2020-09-28 15:27:31,Picture in picture?,3,DaphneQ2,False,Where’s the picture in picture?? Why doesn’t Peacock have that feature?
2020-09-28 20:46:25,Streaming on a Samsung smart tv is problematic,1,IrishGatorGuy,False,"NBC should be tar and feathered. They put all the good soccer match’s on this streaming service and then don’t provide apps that work on a 2019 Samsung TV

Then they announced that it works on Roku. Well not on a Roku Express.

Until they get the licensing agreement worked out. It is worse than useless"
2020-09-22 02:55:17,Errors with using HDMI to TV cord,3,kiera_loverrr,False,"I like the app and the available movies and tv shows, but when I try and use my HDMI connecter cable that plugs into my iPhone, it won’t play anything on my TV."
2020-09-21 20:21:48,Disappointing for Prem Fans,1,tim613,False,Stream is behind always behind by a few minutes. Most games are behind paywall now instead of on NBCSN. Have to switch from pregame on NBCSN or on peacock to the game stream and then back for postgame often times. After years of great coverage I expected more from NBCSN.
2020-09-20 23:22:12,What were you thinking???,1,jonah1445,False,"NBC is going to RUIN the US market for Premier League by pushing us all through an additional subscription that they provided for free through cable just a few months ago. Not to mention it’s not on smart TVs, app is super glitchy, and hard to use."
2020-09-20 12:39:34,Wants to sell your info,1,Shapsgator,False,"So now in order to watch stuff they used to show on NBC, you know I have to give them your personal info so they can sell it to other parties.

2020-08-06 13:32:21,Why cant these other services learn from Pluto?,2,streetreportpod,False,We just want to watch tv. Why can’t all these apps work like Pluto? Just open the app and start watching. Soon as you ask for my email it gets deleted.
2020-09-17 21:30:33,"all sound, no picture",1,Vailsean,False,"That says it all. Signed up to watch the US open golf. Worked great on my 4"" phone screen, but when I tried to stream it from my iPhone to my TV, I got nothing but sound and a black screen. If I wanted that, I'd just turn on the radio. Sheesh!"
2020-09-13 15:54:52,Worst app ever,1,Kesmarcel,False,This is the worst app I’ve ever used I signed up for the premium package to watch premiership soccer but I can’t do a mirror to my Apple TV it’s completely blank when I try to mirror it it’s like it’s blocking me from using Apple TV from my iPhone this is horrible it’s one of the biggest flaws in this app.
2020-09-12 14:09:38,Peacock is the 2020 of streaming apps,1,%%nickname%%,False,"So happy to see that Peacock is onboard with 2020 and decided to make access to sports and quality streaming bottom priorities with the app. I was hoping that with the increase in rates from YoutubeTV, NBC would step up its game. Instead it’s a race to the bottom and we are along for the ride."
2020-08-17 17:18:28,😌,5,big moo💓,False,This app is the best it doesn’t buffer and picks back up right after a commercial love it 😌‼️
2020-07-17 11:49:38,No commercial plan should mean no commercials!,2,Imjustcuban,False,"If I’m paying for no commercials, then I don’t want to be forced to watch stupid Peacock Commercials in between episodes! The cost of this is way to high for what is being offered."
2020-07-30 21:02:56,Worst streaming app I’ve used,1,rera19385,False,This is the first time I have written a review of anything. This is garbage.

2020-07-27 00:54:17,Can’t Reset Password on iPad/iPhone,1,swanlobr,False,"The password reset form blocks paste and 1Password. When I manually type the same password twice, I see a couple “loader” dots flicker briefly, then nothing happens. Hard to rate an application anything other than 1 star if you can’t log in."
2020-07-23 21:11:02,Closed Captioning is badly timed,3,Youngathenians,False,The subtitles generally either show up a second before or after audible sound. You can obviously tell this ruins comedic timing and dramatic effect.
2020-07-17 16:34:00,Force Closes,1,MyGirlFriday1987,False,"I have not been able to use the app because it force closes after the loading screen. I have attempted everything I can think of, uninstalled and reinstalled along with updating my iPad, nothing has worked."
2020-07-15 11:00:22,Bad interface,2,Hallway153,False,The interface of this app needs a lot of work. How do I see my watch list? Finding the complete list of shows is very hard. Poor design overall.
2020-07-16 02:00:32,Streams ads to Apple TV fine but won’t stream the shows,1,Sitruc21,False,Same issues that others seem to be having. Watched 120 seconds of ads for Psych but when the movie started could only get the sound picture was locked. Same issue for Brave New World.
2020-07-15 17:58:22,Terrible quality,1,Sinskiman,False,I’m trying to watch soccer and the quality to that of illegal streams. The game froze twice in the first half and I might as well be playing the original fifa game as everyone is pixelated through out. No idea how this app got an editors choice. I cannot stress how BAD the picture is with this app.
2020-07-15 17:33:56,Its cool but.....,5,CapBluGuy2,False,"peacock is amazing but it doesn’t have anything I like on here Maybe ad some more dreamWorks movies

2020-10-10 01:16:29,Hate it!,2,22lbe,False,First it made me mad that they interrupted the us open and made us have to figure out how to watch it. Now it doesn’t work to watch Yellowstone. I tried to give it one star but it won’t let me!
2020-09-14 19:14:51,Interested in Sports? Look Elsewhere.,2,RustinJ,False,"The only app we use on our TV that freezes frequently so the problem appears to be in Peacock. Very unsettling when viewing live sports. Don’t buy Peacock “Premium”, look elsewhere."
2020-09-19 14:10:21,Absolutely disgraceful,1,mahabshanerz,False,"NBC clearly does not care about their customers. Making them pay for an app that has loads of problems just to watch sports, and peacock is not even compatible with Roku and Firestick. No one wants to watch sports on there phone instead of the TV."
2020-09-19 11:31:39,Greedy tossers,1,Jonnyboy1234567,False,Thanks for splitting up premier league content and holding us fans to ransom. I hope you lose the premier league rights and your app fails all just because you need to try and scrub a few more bucks. And the layout and navigation of the app is horrible.
2020-09-14 19:51:12,Total loser of an app,1,YakYeti,False,"I can understand unreliable performance if the app is free. However, if it is going to cost money, it better work all the time. I’ve a 200mbps Internet service and every other streaming service is working except this one. Totally unsubscribing it..."
2020-09-14 19:43:19,Is technology traveling backwards in time,1,Lytning12,False,Unable to watch using Airplay. Was told by customer service that I can watch on the laptop or iPhone. So the whole family has to crowd around the laptop or phone?  Is technology traveling backwards in time?

2020-08-24 00:45:19,CANCELLING SOON,2,Becoglu,False,"What is the purpose of paying to watch movies and tv shows when on the Apple TV all you just get is sound and a black screen,  this would have been better called Peacock radio!!!!

Please fix this!"
2020-07-26 20:55:57,Does not export to HDMI,2,Roro_Errece,False,This app is the only streaming app by a major network that doesn’t correctly export audio or video through the Apple lightning digital AV adapter. I have tried multiple adaptors and this is the only app with that problem.
2020-08-16 00:11:59,FAIL,1,BluePhoenix70,False,"This app is not available on Roku or any of my three different smart TVs. I tried to access it from my TV browser and it is not supported.

2020-08-13 01:24:24,Constantly Crashes,1,drewittt,False,This app is terrible. It took two hours to watch a 45 minute episode due to the app continuously crashing over and over. This is with the premium subscription by the way. Not worth your time or money.
2020-10-08 19:13:30,Pretty crappy to have NBC behind,2,HLPence,False,Not at all impressed! Can’t watch anything with commercials or it will just keep crashing!! My former boss can build a better app than this crap! Very disappointing
2020-07-21 02:04:19,AppleTV vs iPhone App,3,cschanzen,False,"I have to agree with other reviewers I don’t like how the Watchlist works. It should be a tab just like Browse. Also, the TV app needs to have the fwd/back 10 secs like the iPhone app does."
2020-07-16 19:30:20,It’s barely even free,1,ulikecheese?,False,So I downloaded this app and made an account only to watch one movie that I couldn’t get free anything else :shrek. But it turns out that most of the shows require a paid subscription. There advertising is lying when they say that a lot of stuff is free
2020-07-16 15:13:18,Love it!,5,Dominic McEntee,False,"It’s very nice that it is free, but with free, there’s ads, but they are at the most a minute long (for now at least)."
2020-07-15 22:46:50,Major Flaws,1,Tom10293857,False,"The content they have is great. 
BUT:
• The service is missing most of the networks best all-time shows.
• The “Channels” menu doesn’t display channels it displays TV shows which you can get to from Browse instead. Waste.
• Your WatchList is buried a couple of rows under the “Browse” menu??
• If you paid for NO ads, you still get ads for PEACOCK, a service you already paid for.
• There’s only ONE profile so good luck keeping track of who in your family is where on which show."
2020-10-15 03:10:28,Confusing,1,Tawksung1988,False,"They announced 7 day free but after a day they charge me 4 time, $1 dollar each time. I am not sure yet my credit card still pending them.
I like English Premier, but I hate there’s channel program. I probably move to Spanish Soccer or no more watching."

Although it is not necessarily relevant here, it is also unfortunate that they don’t have apps for Samsung TVs."
2020-08-05 01:50:10,Why is the video so small?,2,Sly Raskal,False,Why doesn’t the app make full use of a phones screen to show the video. Instead I see huge black borders around the video on my iPhone XS Max.  Go full screen on the video!
2020-09-20 02:28:54,Cash grab!,1,Walt DGM,False,"Used to watch all premier league games last year now I have to pay twice for it because they decided to make an exclusive for this crappy app. Money above all, no regard for customer service. I refuse to give money to Disney for the same reason."

2020-07-22 03:40:58,Worse than horrible,1,Elso222,False,"Want a frustrating experience, download the app for ipad. Want to make it worse, add to appletv.

Terrible content once you’re there. Brave New World was an embarrassment as one might expect coming from NBCU. Didn’t get through a second episode."
2020-07-20 16:51:06,No pause or Volume,2,cimeron786,False,It’s a good interface. Intuitive and easy to use however when just channel surfing there is no volume control particularly No Mute or Pause functionality
2020-07-19 00:23:26,"Hey, I got a big screen tv so my weak eyes have it easy",3,manifest viewer,False,I could not throw shows on this app onto my Apple 4 tv. Would it been so hard to put an air drop of some kind!
2020-07-18 06:14:13,Editors’ Choice,1,Than[Q],False,"These “Editors’ Choices” are becoming a joke! They advertise all the stuff you can watch, then ask for your information. On top of that, they’re telling me I cannot watch with VPN. App deleted. You want me to turn off my VPN to watch, I’ll go somewhere else! Don’t waste your time."
2020-10-18 04:50:19,Seriously?,1,daukb,False,What is the point in blocking the ability to screen mirror onto a TV? I have a third gen Apple TV so I cannot add the app onto it. Wanted to simply watch a movie on a bigger screen that wasn’t my phone. What’s the point in blocking this? All it does is frustrate your viewer.
2020-10-16 06:40:57,This app is terrible,1,Petrolero,False,"1.  I don’t have Peacock for my Samsung TV and 

2.  Both Airplay and mirroring are disabled.  Garbage.  

3.  No video controls at all on live streaming.  None.  Why not?

4.  Navigation is awful.  It just comes up with a single, full screen offering from whatever is Trending (usually something stupid or it wouldn’t be trending). You have to figure out how to get to what you really want.  

5.  Why is English Premier League on this godawful platform?  I hope NBC is losing truckloads of money right now."
2020-10-09 22:47:04,Doesn’t support basic AppleTV UI controls.,1,ksgant,False,"For instance, you can’t easily skip ahead 10 seconds like you can on nearly all other apps on AppleTV. They have access to the IOS API and they were like “nah, let’s just do our own thing...which does nothing”."
2020-09-28 19:36:59,Not smooth,1,srijn,False,The only reason I bought the premium was to watch epl and honestly it’s better to watch live games on different illegal links you find on internet than peacock tv. Live stream gets stuck every second
2020-09-20 15:31:27,Garbage app - no cast or screen share,1,graeme19,False,"Waste of money really, can’t cast or share on Apple TV from phone or iPad. They have to update or I’ll find another way of watching and stop paying for the app like everyone else I know who is stoping after the first month"
2020-09-19 16:28:11,Worst streaming service,1,JWKane08,False,Great to have all your stuff in one place! Wrong! Advertise free service then won’t allow to stream to the tv from your phone and you can’t get the shows you want without paying. More of a scam than anything else.
2020-09-14 19:41:26,Money grab,1,LAWMadrinan,False,Ridiculous that you have to pay to watch sports when I already pay for cable to watch NBC Sports. Literally just a money grab by NBC and insane that there’s one soccer game on and guess what? Can’t watch it unless you pay extra money for it.
2020-09-14 16:52:44,"Really, NBC??",1,iconico3am,False,"This is the most un-intuitive app for sports out there. Try searching something simple like, um, today’s line-up & schedule for English Premier League matches.  EPL keyword search results show teams that have played so far - not matches, just the teams. Never a problem with NBC Sports Gold."
2020-08-16 16:36:30,Rip off,1,mnrtst,False,Paid subscription with 5-6 mins of ad breaks every 15 minutes is the worst idea I came across for video streaming. Barely any significant content. Wrapping the same old content from all NBC channels and trying to resell is plain simple low level of greed. it’s demise imminent.
2020-09-04 19:40:57,Peacock TV,5,Spencerwas!5,False,I was wandering if you guys could add more bad girls club and I really you to pretty please add some more bar girls club you guys
2020-08-15 17:10:14,Can’t sign up,1,Bostoncarp,False,Try to sign up get nothing but an error message telling me I error signing up please try again later. Does tell me what it is though.  Oh and I think trying it for 2 days straight after the initial try can be considered later.
2020-07-27 15:06:49,Goodbye soccer,1,mjackmcfc,False,The fact that peacock will not work on hdmi adaptor is a huge loss. I have purchased every app nbc has made for the premier league. I live in the middle of nowhere and do not have internet access. Now it looks like I have to watch every match on a phone. Please fix this!!!!!!!!!!!
2020-07-22 05:55:46,False advertisement,1,OGaeta,False,"It’s not free. Anything that’s worth watching on this app isn’t free. I’d be happier customer if I wasn’t lied to. Unfortunately, this app was made and sponsored by NBC so I should have known better than to expect something honest. My fault really. 

Don’t be like me and waste your time on this."
2020-07-18 16:31:31,Could be good if it worked,1,CSL13,False,"Was excited as app seemed to have some good content I was looking forward to watching but it won’t connect with my Chromecast at all, just keeps failing.  Use lots of other streaming apps through my Chromecast without issue."
2020-07-18 14:00:35,Apple TV but no Peacock App,1,E20XW,False,"If you have an older model Apple TV device it will NOT update to include the Peacock App.  You basically have to buy a new Apple TV device. I can get the Peacock App on my iPhone and ipad, but it will not mirror to my TV.  Every Peacock article and promotion says you can get Peacock if you have an Apple TV.  Not exactly true."
2020-07-17 17:59:17,"NBC, over it!!",1,BigD MN,False,"Was excited and looking forward to this for months, it does not vast to chrome cast.  Screen says ready to connect forever, plays on the device. 

Failed launch, nothing plays, NBC should have tested this prior to launch.  Very disappointed."
2020-07-16 14:40:18,Quality,1,blackie chan 2342069,False,I clicked to watch a movie and it gave me like 160 seconds of adds and when They we’re done it just buffered and timed out and when I clicked resume movie it made me watch ads again and it kept doing this very annoying very wack
2020-10-11 19:34:11,Streaming window,2,AAABossDragon,False,"The streaming service is good, but when I am watching on my iPhone 11, the video doesn’t fill the screen and there is only a small window for the video."
2020-07-15 19:36:32,Unstable,1,cjm2020,False,"Running on an iPad Pro. Feed freezes but sound keeps playing every few minutes. Need to exit out and restart every time. It’s been advertised for months, not like they haven’t had chance to Beta test it."
2020-07-15 17:21:34,Terrible,1,Draw champion,False,This app is terrible. There are too many protections. I am unable to stream from my cell phone to a tv. It is not available on my Samsung TV. It only streams to my Sony TV. Unable to open on my laptop which has a screen connected to it. Unimpressed with this rollout. Had high hopes for NBC.
2020-07-15 16:11:29,Other profiles,5,thomasday101,False,How do I add other profiles on one account
2020-07-15 14:04:44,Awesome Experience!,5,Mohamad C,False,"I’ve been patiently waiting for this app and it’s finally here. I’m in love with the content, thanks Xfinity!"
2020-10-17 22:58:01,UI needs major work,1,Rainydaze12,False,The player is not user friendly and lacks basic features like controlled scrubbing or go back/forward a few seconds by clicking. The actual streaming is good but the UI is awful.
2020-10-17 04:49:59,took out scenes,1,ashlynNnNNnNnNnNnNNnNnNn,False,i was rewatching the harry potter series and i noticed that they had taken out many scenes from each movie. really disappointed because i thought i had found a free way to  watch the series. besides that when a commercial add shows up it doesn’t pause the movie so you end up missing a who 45 seconds of the movie or show. and lastly the recent movie i was in the middle of never shows up on my continue watching. super annoying.
2020-10-09 02:09:23,Not smooth,2,bytrry,False,"Frequently stops and goes, back up for no reason. I have a premium account still have to watch ad. Sometimes yellow spinner just stopped!"
2020-09-10 04:10:50,40 minute shows,2,ppr55,False,"Will only cast to chrome 40 of 43 minutes before jumping to next episode restarting gets another minute
Very annoying. Needs fix now"
2020-09-27 19:28:26,No way to cast to Samsung TV,1,Z Z TOP,False,Why on earth would you put all these important games on this app without an ability to cast to a Samsung tv?  You don’t have an app for the tv and can only cast to a google device... Just keep the important games on NBCSN until you fix this!
2020-09-27 13:10:58,Ads,1,avvedg,False,Ad will come on at the beginning of show which is cool I guess being I’m using the free version. The will skip the first 15 minutes and if you try start over it’s more adds and keeps skipping part of the show.
2020-08-19 21:39:50,Can’t use it with Roku,2,Jacksuman,False,If I had known it would not have worked with my Roku TV and devices I would have never subscribed.  Can’t add the App on my Sharp Aquos TV either.  Doesn’t work with fire stick.  They need to get it together.
2020-08-17 02:51:48,Glitchy,2,NoNickNameHereNowOrEver,False,"- Buffers too often
- doesn’t return to program after commercials
- navigation issues."
2020-08-03 22:28:16,Good app,3,Groovedaddy77,False,It’s a good app and I haven’t had any technical problems except I can’t get it to go to full screen like most other video watching apps.
2020-07-22 23:56:56,Restrictive Accessibility,1,Gesleriana,False,"Won’t allow viewing on a desktop with multiple monitors, no HDMI access, no screen mirroring to project phone to television. (Only screen mirrored the ads).

Psych fans will be disappointed if they don’t have the newest and most expensive technology."
2020-07-16 07:46:16,Free?,1,Boojicheese23,False,"I found this app through one of the app store pages under the home tab. They advertised it as FREE and then when i download it, i have to pay to watch certain content. I’m not mad bc i have to pay, im mad bc it was ADVERTISED as being free when in reality it kind of isn’t"
2020-09-20 19:37:22,NO REWIND OR LATE START!! - ONLY LIVE - GARBAGE,1,Gunner818181,False,I paid for a full year since they are forcing good Premier League matchups to Peacock. ZERO REWINDING AND NO STARTING LATE!!! UNACCEPTABLE!! Clearly whoever created the app and functionality knows nothing about sports and necessary features. Forced to pay for Peacock Premium and it’s worthless. Don’t pay for it until they fix this
2020-09-20 16:16:40,TERRIBLE,1,dpalma98,False,This app is only good if you like to watch stuff on your phone. You CANNOT screen share this to your tv because you will only get audio and no visuals... Honestly I’m glad it comes with a free trial because it’s not worth the money if I can’t STREAM the games to my tv off a STREAMING APP.
2020-09-12 13:38:28,Partial English Premier League coverage,1,Rohitd22,False,"Peacock being an NBC owned app, I was very hopeful that this will finally be the one stop shop for all EPL games. But this is a disappointment just like the previous NBC premier league pass in previous years. At a minimum, NBC should enable a Peacock Premium log in feature to the NBCSN app."
2020-09-07 03:45:50,Where are the shows?,1,Tuath,False,Can’t watch already aired episodes of the current season. NBCU gives you a few weeks to watch or too bad. Guess the dinosaurs at NBCU don’t understand the desires and behaviors of people these days. Sorry your up service will be a flop.
