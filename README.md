# Streaming-App-Analysis

Purpose: Extract and analyze the reviews of 5 different streaming apps. The apps were selected because they represent both, apps with good ratings such as Hulu, Netflix, and Disney+ and some with bad ratings such as HBO Max and Peacock TV. The general purpose is to understand what features makes an app enjoyable for customers and what features don't.

The analysis involved identifies main topics in the reviews for each of the streaming apps through topic modeling (LSA). Then, the topics are compared based on the average ratings of the reviews per topic. Additionally, the reviews and apps are also compared using a Part of Speech Tagging approach.
